        "description": "<p>In the world of Asphalt, roads and highways have become a playground for violent criminals. Only heavily armed vehicles dare travel between cities. It is your job as a truck driver to deliver your cargo despite all dangers.</p>\n<p>Asphalt is a top-down shooter, you don't have to worry about driving (the road is as straight as it can be), all you have to do is shoot your opponents before they have a chance to do too much damage to your vehicle. You have a machine gun turret with unlimited ammunition, a flamethrower and some mines, as well as a damage display to see what part of the truck needs to be protected.</p>\n<p>The difficulty is rather progressive, each new level bringing new, better armed opponents, requiring new tactics to defeat them without damaging your vehicle too much. You can also grab some bonuses like extra ammo, instant repair or bonus points.</p>",

No surface, but many obstacles formed a labyrinth with big gaps to move in. Some creatures want to taste robots, it leads to loss of robot's energy, so you have to shoot them in horizontal plane. Also unique features of robots allow you as pilot-manager to use robots as a team. XOR collects the resources, SAM repairs other robots but not itself if they break-down, and RHO transmits communications from the other two robots back to you.</p>",

In turns, each of you have to guide a ball down a gutter surrounded by a patchwork 3D effect. This is done by steering it left and right to give it angular acceleration.</p>\n<p>You can hit the jesters, kings, queens, and chalices for points and bonuses. Avoid the axemen and monks - the axeman takes your life, and monk returns you to the start of the game/ Different royal members, including monks, increase your score. As such, hitting monks can be a good move if you are confident. On the right of the screen you may see your career progress in the gutter (D/1/2/3/0/S).</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Amstrad CPC appears to be the only released version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Grandslam\">Grandslam's</a> original vision of a licensed Liverpool FC game (a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Striker\">Striker</a>-style <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Liverpool+Computer+Game\">forced perspective 3D game</a> surfaced for 16-bit systems in 1992, and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Liverpool+Commodore+Computer\">a slightly simplified top-view version for C64 a year later</a>). A human player must represent Liverpool, and can play either single 1 or 2 player matches or a full league. The second team always wears white. The English Division 1 teams of the time are included, with their 11 first-choice players named. Attendances are calculated, and goalscorers are recorded.</p>\n<p>The action is viewed side-on, and uses a power bar to affect the strength of passes and shots - two bars move along the bottom of the screen in sequence, and must be stopped as close together as possible to produce a good contact with the ball. </p>\n<p>The ball sticks to a player's foot. Players appear to occasionally freeze, and sometimes two players will get jammed together, and need a third to move the ball. The view is very close-up, but a scanner of the whole pitch is provided, as well as a running clock.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In this sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/26742/billy-la-banlieue/\">Billy la Banlieue</a> the player takes on the role of RockaBilly, who wears black jacket, black sunglasses, earring, blue bandanna, and usually move around the streets with the purpose of playing new video games. Again, the streets are full of thugs preventing RockaBilly from reaching his favorite video game machines. Now RockaBilly has to fight with them using hands and legs (instead of the tools available in the predecessor), take their money, and use this money in the video game machines. The video games are new and represent classical Trampoline Jumping and Cowboy Shooting games.</p>",

Starting at the waves you dive deeper and deeper to the reefs, which form a labyrinth and block your way. During the diving you should move left/right, swim up or passively fall down on the screen until you reach its boundary, when you progress from one screen to another.\nUnderwater inhabitants such as crabs or skates are harmful to your diving-suit so you have to shoot them with your pistol. You also have to push the dynamite to the seabed, find the doors, follow the passages, and collect the treasures. Encountering the depth sensors in the reefs you may check your position on the map. Your oxygen supply is exhausting during a diving so you have to top it up regularly.</p>\n<p>Game may be played in turns by 1 or 2 players of the same or different sex.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the quite distant future, the universe is governed by an organisation known as the Foundation. You are Jack Bludfield, one of its former agents, now turned bounty hunter. You have now heard that your old partner, Xocann, has escaped from his prison planet. To exact revenge on Xocann, who once murdered your woman and left you to die, you take it on you to track him down. You start out in New York, where you must fool security guards and security systems, and track down someone who can give you a clue where to go next.</p>\n<p>For an adventure game, Fugitif uses a rather unique icon-based system. The entire screen is filled with still pictures of what you see, and you move from screen to screen using the cursor keys. All system messages are printed on the icon screen, from which you execute all commands bar movement. The command screen contains 20 icons which represent all the different verbs of your glossary. Double click a verb to go to another set of icons, representing all the usual objects you can expect to find. Apart from the 19 standard objects, more icons can pop up according to what can be found on a particular screen or in your inventory. It is possible to manipulate several objects at once with one verb, allowing you to build intricate actions such as moving a knocked-out guard's hand to an electronic lock requiring a particular biometric signature. On the other hand, the wealth of actions and objects available at all times can be rather overwhelming.</p>\n<p>Fugitif contains graphics drawn in the Amstrad's high resolution mode, which usually only allows 4 colours, but innovates by extending the colour pallette using smart interrupt programming.</p>",

These catacombs formed a labyrinth are filled with flowers, acid cans and are controlled by your enemies representing dinosaurs, mutants, robots, and undeads. The contact with enemies is lethal for you, so you have to find the flowers of appropriate color, and shoot the balls of such color at the monsters of such color to kill them. Also you should clear your way of acid cans. To do this you should most often fly to appropriate position of complex labyrinth to shoot the can through the gap in the wall. It is because of your ability to shoot in horizontal plane only. To increase your energy you should find the barbecues.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Galactic Plague</em> is an alien shoot up in the vein of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=space+invaders\">Space Invaders</a>. In this version each screen has between 4 and 20 alien craft of differing variety. Each variety of alien moves in a different pattern but always down and usually at a rate of knots, dropping bombs as they do so (often just one enemy can blanket the screen in bombs, almost inevitably causing the demise of the player). The ship controlled by the player is confined to moving along the bottom of the screen. The secret of progressing in the game was therefore learning the patterns of the aliens and learning where to place the ship to shoot down the various hordes without getting crushed by the hundreds of dropped bombs or colliding with an alien as it hit the bottom of the screen, where it just wrapped around to reappear at the top.</p>\n<p>The player only has three lives and many players found this game to be extremely difficult if not completely impossible after just a few screens, however, the game is completable. There are approximately 50 different screens and upon beating the last wave of enemies, the game goes straight back to screen No.1.</p>",

Here you are a Birdie in some sci-fi world filled with robots, carnivorous plants, parachutes, raptors, barbarians, lasers, butterflies, magical doors, hyperspace, etc. You should survive in this world with help of your wings and flying techniques.</p>\n<p>The game is flown in third-person view, where you may control a bird moving him/her left or right, flying up or descending down, and flapping the wings. To fly correctly, the bird has to move in the air at a certain speed. Once the latter increases, the bird is handy. If bird's speed drops below a certain threshold, the bird then follows one of the oldest laws of the universe, gravity. Flapping wings enables bird to gain altitude and flying down on the wings increases speed.</p>\n<p>The scoreboard on the screen tells you your speed (red = stall), altitude, the remaining time before the night, your life energy (no energy = game over). Flying at altitude for too long will attract predators, give no points, and exhaust the energy unnecessarily. Eating butterflies allows you to recover energy, but remember that eating too much makes you aggressive!</p>\n<p>The environment, where Birdie is flying, will change during the game. Starting in the forest, you will visit other dimensions through Magical Doors as well as descend the dungeons, and even meet lamas.</p>",

The CPC version unleashes macho cop Marion 'Cobra' Cobretti onto the streets to protect fashion model Ingrid from the psychotic Night Slasher and his army of goons in eight side-scrolling levels. </p>\n<p>All eight stages actually take place on the same (very long) game map; only the starting location differs. In each level, the goal is to meet a kill quota: a certain number of enemies must be taken out to advance automatically to the next stage. Enemies come running along the street, hide in trash cans or shoot from windows, armed with throwing knives, machine guns or rocket launchers. Also present: dive-bombing ducks(!). Cobra can take a few hits before he loses a life; an extra one is awarded every 10.000 points.</p>\n<p>At the start, Cobra is unarmed and must punch out the bad guys, but some enemies leave behind hamburgers that when picked up give one of three weapon power-ups: a machine gun, a pistol or a throwing knife, each with only limited energy, which can be refilled by collecting another hamburger.</p>\n<p>Starting in level three, Ingrid will appear and Cobra must follow and protect her. She can't be harmed though, at least until level six, when the Night Slasher appears. Failing to protect Ingrid means the loss of a life.</p>",

The player controls a character, or acolyte, who is sending their spirit out to follow pathways along the Tree Of Life. \nThe ultimate objective of the game is to guide the acolyte along a predetermined path through ten spheres of existence to achieve Godhead. Along the way there are objects that must be collected before the acolyte can pass from one sphere to the next. There are also demons, creatures of the dark side, who will sap the acolyte's energy.</p>\n<p>There are three levels of difficulty and the game keeps track of the highest score of the session.

There are six opponents each with their own characteristics and names. Mad Joe for example moves around a lot but doesn't throw many punches while Jef is a champion with a killer punch who doesn't move much at all.</p>\n<p>The game is keyboard or joystick controlled and the same keys / joystick movements are used for movement and for throwing punches. For example a joystick movement diagonally up and right (single player keyboard equivalent W) will move the fighter in that direction while the same movement with the FIRE button pressed will initiate a jab to the head.</p>\n<p>This game is compatible with the AMSTRAD SSA-1 Speech Synthesizer.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Assault On Port Stanley</em> takes place during the Falkland Wars and the player takes the role of an S.A.S. commander and has to liberate Port Stanley from the Argentinian occupants. The task at hand is to break through the enemy blockade and pick up troops from a sabotage mission behind enemy lines. </p>\n<p>The game is split into three stages. The game starts with the player being aboard a warship that is slowly approaching land. This section works similarly to the battle station sequence of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/19932/beach-head/\">Beach-Head</a>. The player takes control of the ship's cannon from a first person perspective and has to shot down the enemy ships as they appear while at the same time avoiding their fire. At any time the player can take off with his helicopter and move on to the next stage which is a shoot 'em up game in the style of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7949/1942/\">1942</a>. However the helicopter has a limited amount of fuel and therefore the player can't launch it too early, as it won't be enough to reach the shore. The number of waves of enemy planes in this section depends on how many ships the player has destroyed in the naval stage. Upon reaching the island the third stage is launched which plays like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=River+Raid\">River Raid</a>. The player flies his helicopter over a channel while trying to avoid the cliffs on the sides and the enemy boats and barrages. Along the banks there will be stations where the player can land to pick up men and refuel. At the end of the level the player gets bonus points for each man that has been rescued.</p>",

In the garden of the witch there are many charms lying around and if these are collected the spell can be lifted. The player himself can't move though, so he has to get help from a snake, Nibbler, who has to make his way through the nine sections of the garden and collect all the charms. </p>\n<p>The game plays similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a> albeit without any enemies that chases the player. For each level Nibbler has to collect most of the charms (a few can be left behind). The problem is that the snake grows every second, making things harder since it will lose a life if it collides with its own tail. A life is also lost if the snake stands still too long without moving. The game is over when all five lives are lost.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The setting of <em>Survivor</em> is Deadstone Abbey, a desolate manor house that has been vacant for decades. In it there is a king's random scattered about that has been untouched due to booby traps and the evil forces that live there. An adventurer desperate for money known as Angus is confident that he is skilled enough to get the fortune and escape from the manor alive. Now it's up to the player to navigate Angus through the maze like interiors of the manor and retrieve the treasure.</p>\n<p>Survivor is an action game where the player has to make his way through the seven levels of the mansion which has 1008 rooms in total. In each room spirits wander around that the player can shoot or just sneak past. The player can move in all directions but only shoot right and left. A spirit is killed with a single bullet but more respawn constantly. In addition to the standard gun it's also possible to use a porcupine bomb that frightens all nearby enemies. Treasure such as coins and rings are scattered all around and by collecting it, as well as killing spirits, the player earns points. As the player takes damage when in contact with spirits he also needs to find bottles of life giving elixir that replenishes his strength. It's also necessary to look out for ammunition for the gun as it is limited. </p>\n<p>The objective of each level is to clear a certain number of bombs. In some rooms there are signposts that show the direction to the nearest bomb. The number of bombs increases with each level and the enemies get harder to avoid and frighten.</p>",

Other painting companies has quit the job due to it not being safe, but Binky has no such concerns and accepts the job despite all its hazards. Each level of the game is a floor of the building which is viewed from an isometric perspective. The objective is simply to paint the whole floor which is done automatically as Binky moves across it. Since the floors somehow are floating around in mid air it's possible to run off the edge of the floor and fall to a certain death if not careful. There are also various nasty creatures that Binky has to watch out for. These will suddenly appear on the floor and move in one direction until they either get to Binky or fall of the floor. There are also beasts that move straight for Binky but these can be killed if stepped on before they hatch. There are also balls that roll around the floors. Later levels need to be painted with two or three coats of paints and require Binky to move over them multiple times.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>RoboCop 2</em> for Amstrad machines follows the same template as the other versions of the game released by Ocean Software in that it combines platforming action, a puzzle mode and a shooting gallery, but with different level designs and gameplay mechanics.</p>\n<p>In the three platform levels, RoboCop must find the goal point of the level before time and energy (which decreases continually) run out. The levels are full of hazards like electricity, rolling boulders, falling spikes, stomping machinery and more. Compared to other versions of the game, enemies are relatively rare and no gun power-ups are available. Robo can collect extra lives, energy and short-time invincibility power-ups, though. Optionally, he can collect Nuke drug canisters and arrest suspects, both of which give bonus points at the end of the level. Suspects should not be shot, however, because doing so drains the energy substantially. Every level contains several one-screen bonus rooms: entering these presents RoboCop with both more hazards but also more items to collect. Entering a room also activates a reset point so the level doesn't have to be started over again when a life is lost. The last level concludes with a boss battle against Cain aka \"RoboCop 2\".</p>\n<p>After every platform level, a puzzle level follows. To regain Robo's lost memories, a cursor must be moved over a circuit board with the goal of hitting all black chips while avoiding all red ones. Moving the cursor leaves a trail of burnt circuitry which must not be crossed again. It is possible to re-arrange the board by shifting the current row left or right or the current column up or down. Four boards must be completed successfully within three minutes to gain the maximum number of points.</p>\n<p>In the shooting gallery, targets appear in windows and on the street, and a crosshair must be moved to hit them. Both criminals and innocents are among the targets: naturally, the civilians should be spared to achieve the best possible score.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Execution</em> is a word guessing game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Hangman+games\">Hangman</a>. But here, rather than being hanged when answering wrong, the player gets executed by a firing squad. The player guesses the word by inputting one letter at a time. When making a wrong guess or when taking too long a soldier enters the screen. Once the full squad is positioned in front of the player they will begin the execution. The game can be played by up to six players and a game consists of eight rounds. The player with most points at the end wins the game. The game difficulty can be customized and it's possible to change the number of incorrect guesses that can be made as well as the maximum response time. It's also possible to turn on clues. The vocabulary consists of over 1000 words and it that's not enough the player can create his own word list.</p>",

The game begins with a qualification lap before the race itself starts. Racing is arcade-style, with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/16/outrun/\">Outrun</a>-style 3rd person perspective view graphics and a timer that indicates how much time is left before the next checkpoint has to be reached. Opponents fill the track and billboards fill its sidelines - crashing too fast into either displays a spectacular crash animation and takes valuable time off the clock. The game offers a choice of automatic or manual gear switching. The time of day passes during racing, thus offering driving in sunsets and sunrises and during the night.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Activator</em> is a side-view flick-screen maze game, where you control an Activator Pod sent into the Space Port Antari found on the edge of the Sol Galaxy. An unknown power source has rendered any carbon based life-forms and their equipment inactive, and as the last of the power has emptied, a distress signal was sent out, and you have picked it up and found the Space Port's location from it. You are the Commander of a Federation Patrol and Space Port Protection Craft and when you have got close enough to Antari you have sent the Activator Pod inside. The Pod's aim, under your control, is to find fuel-rods to activate the power and place them in Room 97. </p>\n<p>You can carry only three items at a time and other items you need to be aware of are bullets and key-passes. The bullets allow you to shoot and destroy the various aliens roaming the corridors of Antari and if you touch one the you lose part of a power gauge. When the gauge empties then you lose one of nine lives. The key-passes allow you to go through doors but both are labelled with letters from A to G and can only be used if the letters match.</p>",

In a two player game, one player has to guess the word, when the other player selects the word. The word is guessed one letter at a time and if correct then the letter appears in the word made up of dashes. If the letter is wrong then part of a man appears who is getting hanged on a scaffold. The game ends once the word is either guessed or the whole man appears and is hung. If only one player is playing then they select a group from different groups of categories that include geography, transport and maths. The computer selects a word from that category and the player has to guess the word. There is also a facility to add words to the categories.</p>",

You move your craft left, right and a small distance forward as a Centipede type creature moves along the top of the screen, moving downwards one place when it reaches the sides. Scattered all over the screen are mushrooms which block your movements but can be removed after a couple of shots and if the Centipede hits one then it moves downwards one place and moves the opposite direction. If the Centipede is shot then it splits into two, and when the other parts of the Centipede are shot then they also split into two. Other creatures appear like spiders and snails and these can be shot or avoided and if you touch any creature then you lose one of three lives. Once the Centipede has been removed then you move to the next level.</p>",

Dan Dare and his friend Digby fly towards the asteroid, looking to destroy it. While searching for an entrance, Digby is captured by the Treens. Now it falls to Dan alone to save the day, armed with only his laser gun.</p>\n<p>The game is a side-view platformer with light adventure elements, taking place over almost a hundred screens depicting the inside of the asteroid. Dan must complete several goals: to destroy the asteroid, he has to activate the self-destruct. The activation mechanism however is across a large chasm, in the same place where Digby is held. To cross it, Dan must collect four bridging pieces. Once the self-destruct is activated, Dan and Digby must flee the asteroid by using the Mekon's rocket ship. Time is limited: an indicator shows how little time Earth has left. Standing in Dan's way are automated defense emplacements as well as Treens. If Dan is hit, he loses energy. If it runs out or a Treen touches him, he is captured and thrown into a prison cell. Luckily, the cell's door is faulty and he has no trouble escaping, but will lose valuable time.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Groops!</em> is a tile based puzzle game based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=SameGame\">SameGame</a> concept. The game is played on a board with a large number of tiles with different colours and symbols. The aim is to remove as many tiles as possible by clicking on clusters of two or more tiles of the same kind. Tiles located above the removed tiles will then drop down and take their places. When a column becomes empty the tiles left of it will move and take its place. The game goes on until there are no more tiles that can be removed. </p>\n<p>There are three different game modes: normal, fast and challenge. In the normal mode the whole playing field is covered by tiles while the fast mode only has half the amount. The challenge mode consists of a series of sixteen increasingly more difficult levels. To progress from one to another a minimum score has to be reached.</p>",

The player takes control of Dempsey who has two hours to locate and rescue his partner Makepeace who has been captured and is held somewhere in London. To find clues about here whereabouts he has to explore various buildings around the city. This is done from a third person perspective and the player can interact with the environment through an icon based interface which is used to examine, pick up and use objects. There is also an inventory icon as well as a phone that can be used to telephone clues back to Spikings. Upon doing so the player's score increases. In addition to finding Makepeace there are three other crimes to solve.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the player will come across armed criminals and the game then starts an action sequence where Dempsey is controlled from a top down perspective and can attempt to shoot the enemy. The game also involves driving sequences where the player steers his car from one building to another. Crashing the car will lead to a loss of time since Dempsey has to find a new one.</p>",

These are the player's guns and are shot when the corresponding key is pressed. The keys are protected by barriers that are weakened every time they are hit by aliens. If a barrier is completely destroyed the alien will reach the key which will lead to a game over for the player.

The player controls an armed man, supposedly a gangster, who can walk left and right down the bottom of the screen while shooting at the enemies above him. The enemies, which are represented by icons of objects of the era (such as tommy guns, beer mugs, cars etc.), move back and forth according to certain patterns while dropping projectiles that the player character has to avoid. Each type of enemy has its own movement pattern. The player getting hit will lead to a lost life and when all four lives are gone the game is over. An extra life is given for every 2000 points earned. Before starting out there are five difficulty levels to choose from.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Contact was broken between the planet of Astul and the rest of the galaxy, and it reverted to barbarism. A Roman inspired group led by the Ephore Crassus has conquered the city of New-Cythere from a Spartan inspired group. Four adventurers have then turned up at the citadel, and started asking questions about a mysterious chamber beneath the city. You control these adventurers, and your aim is to find information about what is going on, and leave the city.</p>\n<p>This French language game is a typical turn based first person 3D dungeon crawler. You have a single pool of character points to assign to the abilities of all four party members (Alton, Elisabeth, Jofil and Eddy). Abilities affect physical based attack (e.g. Constitution and Agility) and supposedly also mental characteristics (e.g. Intelligence, Aura, Observation, etc). Once the characters are prepared, you start in the ground floor of the citadel. </p>\n<p>Interaction is through an icon based menu system, with options allowing movement, sorting of character inventory, seeing your character stats and seeing your orientation. Once movement mode is selected, the party moves by using the arrow keys. Most encounters occur at predetermined positions. Some will be non-hostile characters, where an interaction menu is opened which allows talk, trade and combat. There are also many hostile praetorian guards. When these are met, a combat menu will open up.</p>\n<p>Combat occurs by selecting each party member in turn, and choosing an action. These include parry, lunge, strike, persuasion and running. If there are multiple opponents, you can select which one to strike. After this, pressing the forwards arrow executes the commands. Damage in each round is dependent on character stats and weapon/armor stats. The process continues until one side is defeated. If your opponents are defeated, they usually leave items (but they disappear once you enter movement mode again).</p>\n<p>Each character may carry (and automatically be equipped with) one weapon, one shield, one helm and one suit of armour. Keys may also be found, which open locked doors. In addition to this is a bag of four items for the party rather than the individuals. There are at least five levels of the citadel. There does not appear to be any mechanism for character improvement (such as experience and levelling). There also seems to be no important dialogue during the game. The explanation for what is happening is supposedly revealed once the party has completed their investigation and returned to their starting point.</p>",

Like the original game it is played on a single screen that is full of stone blocks. The player is in control of a red bird that has to push the blocks around to create passages and to crush the blue creatures that wander around the screen. If caught by one of the blue creatures, one of three lives is lost. After losing a life it is possible for a brief time to kill the creatures by simply moving over. It is also possible to kill them by destroying the blocks that they are spawning from. Additionally there are three diamond blocks. Pushing these so that they are all connected to each other leads to bonus points. To advance to the next level the player has to stay alive for a certain amount of time or kill all the blue creatures.</p>",

You need to drop bombs on the buildings below so that you can land on the ground safely, however you can only drop one bomb at a time.

When playing against the AI, the game has a built-in advice system and will at any time show the best next three moves.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Charly Diams</em> is an action adventure game about a young man Charly searching for a hiding place of a treasure with blue diamonds. The player should help Charly to collect seven miraculous flowers scattered around the world in order to unveil this place. Charly can walk, jump normal, jump high, swim, dive, change clothes, and regain his stamina visiting the places such as green plain, snowy mountain, hot desert, and warm sea. The circular world of the game is divided on static screens, and Charly can consequently proceed from one adjacent screen to another in any order. The stamina of Charly is decreased with his travel, and it should be re-filled with certain actions such as drinking a liquid or breathing over the sea waters. The girls proposing the liquid are dancing, while Charly is drinking. The clothes of Charly should be changed manually in special houses to be able to survive in the regions of different climate or specifics. An encounter with deadly scorpions or crazy riflemen, a fall from a mountain's road, a drowning in the water, or a complete loss of the stamina can kill Charly, taking out one of his three lives.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Paraplane / Paragliding</em> is a simulation of paragliding sports. The gameplay includes activities such as taking off, paragliding with air currents, avoiding the obstacles, and landing. The player can direct the paraplane left or right, accelerate, decelerate, and descend. The game starts with the training, where the player should get the skills to roam the real complex environments. Each training stage contains weighted places. The player should reach and land onto the place, collecting 100 points. Completing three stages of training flights, the player is awarded with a certification. Only after obtaining this certification, the player can choose a one of four sites such as the Alps (France), the Himalayas (Nepal), the Grand Canyon (the U.S.A.), or the Andes (Peru). In these locations, while the player is in the air, the score is increased, but it can be gained only on reaching a final destination after passing through checkpoints and avoiding different flying objects such as airplanes and deltaplanes. Top five scores are stored for each of these sites. Other platforms have their own specifics described in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Paragliding\">Paragliding</a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Zox 2099</em> describes a rescue mission of an intergalactic hero on his way to set free four hostages of the planet Hullm from clutches of Zox asteroid. </p>\n<p>The game combines two modes of gameplay. One of them is a spacecraft shooting arcade, and another is a labyrinth crawler. First of all, the player should fight in the space, destroy all encountered enemy ships, and finally arrive on the huge asteroid. It is achieved with a shooting at the ships and their missiles while showing the direction for each shot. Numerous damages of the player's ship lead to the game over.</p>\n<p>After the asteroid is reached, the player enters its labyrinth fortress with 20 rooms. Here the player should move from room to room, searching for transition spots. In each room the walls should be examined to find the secret passages with attempts to move the fragments of these walls. Also some switches can be toggled to open the doors or remove the electric barriers. Enemies are guarding the corridors, and they should be avoided or neutralized for a limited time with a gun. If enemy guard will reach the player, the player is moved to the starting point of the labyrinth. There are four hostages to find.</p>\n<p>Once all the hostages are found, the player should flight back to his home planet in the same spacecraft shooting arcade.</p>",

The game does not use a textual interface, like most of the adventure games of its time; instead the player has to associate two words within a very long list.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Last day of the election campaign in a climate of extreme political tension. The police apparatus in charge of the protection of the deputy is particularly reinforced. At the same time, four groups of protesters are heading towards the main square of the city ... </p>\n<p>Choose your side ... for the urban guerilla !!!</p>\n<p>A daring political game about turbulent events of France's 1986 elections. Pouvoir is an urban guerilla sim between police backing CRS on one side and protesters in red shirts on the other!</p>\n<p>If you play with a friend, one of you controls the CRS, and the other the protesters. In case of solitary pleasure (but without a stick of joy, all done on the keyboard), you play the police. Your goal will be to protect the Town Hall Square until 9 pm, because the speech of a Member must take place there. The game starts at 3 pm, and each round lasts 15 minutes in game time. A complete game is likely to spread over 24 rounds. And during all this time, dozens of protesters will lead you hard while trying to infiltrate the streets of Paris. Yes, Pouvoir is actually a turn-based strategy game, punctuated by mini-games when the two opposing groups face each other.</p>\n<p>The CRS appear in blue on the map, and the demonstrators in red (it's a finesse, ah ah ah!). When one of the small characters (a relatively ugly sprite) is white, it means you control it during the turn. There are then several phases of play during which it will be possible for the CRS, to move, to pose barriers in strategic places (six maximum), to hold his place (do not move) or unlike launch Offensive - for this, your CRS sprite must be on a square adjacent to a box with a protester. A small action sequence then launches at the bottom of the screen, and you must run to apprehend the protester while avoiding his projectiles - tomatoes, cobblestones or Molotov cocktails.</p>\n<p>When the AI (or a friend who plays with you) takes control of the demonstrators, they are likely to move (and they will, with the place of the town hall in sight) and of course, they will not back down not facing adversity. If a street is blocked by a barrier, during an arcade phase the protester will have to run and jump over it with the right timing - otherwise ,he takes damage, and if he takes too much, he disappears (dies). he really?!). He can also decide to load the CRS, the latter can throw him a baton horizontally - it looks like a laser, but let's move on. It will be time again quthe estion of timing: running and jumping over the baton to fight with the CRS hand-to-hand - in this case, the victory automatically returns to the protester (we did not say breaker yet) , at the time?).</p>\n<p>In short, the CRS will have to hold until 21 hours or to make disappear all the demonstrators by then - unlikely, as they are numerous. The latter win the game if they reach the place of the town hall before the fateful hour or if they eliminate all the CRS.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Uwol 2: Quest for Money</em> is the sequel to the 2009 title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/130745/uwol-quest-for-money/\">Uwol: Quest for Money</a>. While some elements are familiar, it has different gameplay compared to the original game. After the events of the first game Uwol exits the Storm Palace with his fortune, when he is hit by surprise by a Fanty guardian and falls down a long slope, ending up in the Phantomas' Electric Garden and losing all his coins. He decides to head home anyway until he discovers there are pipes in the garden similar to those in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Super+Mario+Bros\">Super Mario Bros</a>, leading to caves full of coins. The choice is now up to the player: just try to exit the garden or go for the extra risk by collecting coins as well.</p>\n<p>Just like in the first title the game consists of a large amount of single-screen rooms, but they are now linked together into a large, single level that can be explored freely. Uwol needs to explore and pick up several keys to open up gates eventually leading to the exit. Optionally there are also tennis balls to collect often in difficult places. The rooms in the garden use the familiar gameplay with enemies on platforms that need to be avoided as Uwol has no means to attack. After a single hit he still loses his clothes and then needs to pick up the shirt that appears in the room to regain the protection. When hit without clothes one of the nine lives provided at the start is lost.</p>\n<p>Coins can only be found in the underground caves accessed through pipes. There is no longer a time limit per room, but the caves have the Fanties that would appear when time runs out in the first game, chasing Uwol. He needs to lure them in certain directions, get past them by jumps and quickly gather all coins before exiting again. Other game elements are spikes and moving platforms. There is a difference in the colour and music for the rooms above and under the ground.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Gates to Hell</em> is a 2D platform game set in the near future with bright and colourful graphics. A few old computer gurus have learned about <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Bill+Gates\">Bill Gates</a>'s goal to alienate humanity with a new computer operating system: Windows to Hell (W2H). The player's character is an Amstrad user who has been recruited to infiltrate the Microsoft facility and infect the central computer with a dangerous virus to destroy all source code.</p>\n<p>The game consists of more than 150 screens divided over three levels. They are single-screen rooms connected both horizontally and vertically to form a large environment using the flip-screen mechanic with an amount of freedom to explore. The player's character can only move around and jump while avoiding enemies such as snakes, parrots, bats, arrows, killer monitors and hazards such as dangerous drop of liquid.</p>\n<p>The first level starts in the forest where the company's bunker needs to be located. A key will be required to get in through the entrance. In the second level the central computer needs to be infected. Other computers have already been targeted, but not the central ones. The character has a health meter and in this level there are a few Z80 computers that can be picked up to restore some health. In the third level W2H is destroyed, but the character still needs to exit the facility. There is a countdown with time pressure and many traps to avoid. When all health is gone, the game is over. The game has exploration with some minor environment based puzzling with keys, lever and computer terminals.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Aqua</em> is a 2D game somewhat similar to the concept of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/403/bubble-ghost/\">Bubble Ghost</a>. The player controls an air bubble and needs to safely guide it to the surface. Starting underwater there are 20 levels or single screen rooms that need to be completed. Once the bubble starts to move it keeps moving at a steady speed, so the player constantly needs to adjust the movement as it is not possible to hold still completely anymore until the next screen is reached. Along the way typical underwater elements need to be avoided such as rocks, walls, crabs, fishes and so on. The bubble has a health meter and every collision removes a part of it.</p>",

When she comes in contact with an enemy or a hazard a life is lost. She has no means to attack.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Phantomas 2.0</em> is an unofficial remake of the 1986 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Phantomas+II\">Vampire</a>, which was the sequel to the 1986 ZX Spectrum game released in the same year: <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/15585/phantomas/\">Phantomas</a>. Unlike the UK version of the 1986 game which introduced the character Brok the Brave, the remake stars the original protagonist from the Spanish version: Phantomas. He is an android thief and was captured during his last mission on the Earth-Gamma planet in the first game where he stole treasure from a millionaire's mansion. This time he has a mission on Earth as he ventures into the castle of Count Dracula to defeat him and bring back order and peace to the region. This remake closely mirrors the original game with the original challenges, design, enemies and level lay-out. The largest changes are in the entirely new visual design and art, tweaked elements, new music and improved responsiveness.</p>\n<p>The player controls Phantomas through different rooms of the castle. Those are all single screens linked together both horizontally and vertically offering an amount of freedom to explore freely. Phantomas has no means to attack and he needs to complete platforming sections avoiding enemies, traps and hazards. He starts with one life and can earn additional ones by picking up pieces of chicken. Several sections are locked and first require a key. To confront Count Dracula himself three weapons need to be gathered first: a cross, a hammer and a stake. There are also six shutters that need to be opened so the sunlight is brought in to weaken Dracula. The castle consists of different environment with regular rooms, a roof section and catacombs. Several additional items and gameplay mechanics are revealed while playing.</p>",

Each wave or level lasts for about 10 seconds, during which time hordes of creatures of a specific type traverse the screen from right to left. The earliest waves are populated with relatively harmless Rammers, followed by more erratically moving Mushys and Spiders and eventually highly mobile Swoopers which can shoot and the very fast moving Baiters. Contact with the aliens or their projectiles will cause you to lose one of your jets. Shooting them gives you points, with the more dangerous aliens being worth more.</p>\n<p>After the ten waves of nasties have been avoided, a starship appears which moves with a fairly unpredictable vibrating motion. Directly touching the nose of your ship to the exact centre of the back of the starship allows you to dock to earn bonus points. However even a narrow miss will cause your jet to explode. After the starship disappears, the colour of the screen changes and you loop back to the Rammers at a slightly faster speed.</p>",

Uncanny diseases, which were previously unknown, are rampant among humans and claim many victims. The plant world mutated and for unknown reasons, a deadly green carpet grows over the land. Fear and terror prevail among the already decimated humanity. It seems as if nature has conspired against man and is now striving to wipe him from the face of the earth for good. A small group of survivors saves themselves on a secluded island in the Saragossa-Sea, where life is still possible without dangers and dangers. There the refugees discover the remains of a lost culture. An ancient prophecy has been engraved on the stone tablets, which tells of a blue crystal whose mysterious power could save mankind from destruction. But the only clue to the place where this crystal is said to be is a clue to an underground temple. This chance, however small it may be, must of course not go unused. And so the strongest, bravest and most intelligent is chosen. Thus begins an adventurous odyssey above and below the lonely island, in the vastness of the mysterious  Saragossa-Sea.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Roland in Space</em> is a 2D scrolling platform game where you play a lord of time who must travel to seven different planets and collect the 158 components of the ARNOLD super-weapon. Once complete, this weapon will allow Roland to defeat the evil Maestro and save the universe. The game is a direct sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/57920/roland-in-time/\"> Roland in Time </a> and has similar game-play and mechanics.</p>\n<p>The player can choose which of the seven worlds they wish to explore from the planet screen. Roland then appears from out of his phone-box like space-ship on the selected planet and can start collecting weapon pieces, represented by flickering blue orbs. Roland can move around the screen using left, right and jump keys. Other keys allow you to scroll the screen independently of moving the character. The landscape is odd in that some of it allows Roland to walk and jump through it and prevents him falling. Some other areas will collapse under him as soon as he walks on it, and there are even invisible semi-solid areas that slow Roland's rate of fall, but will allow him to gain height by continually jumping.</p>\n<p>Roland starts the game with nine regenerations, but these will easily be lost to fast moving enemies, inconveniently placed traps and falls from reasonable heights. Once all of the weapon fragments on a planet have been collected, the screen flashes. At any time, Roland can return to his phone-box and so back to the planet screen. The collected weapon parts do not re-spawn when the planet is visited again, but the rest of the level does refresh.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mokowe</em> is a French first-person adventure game taking place in Kenya's Mokow\u00e9 settlement in May 1975. The player is a brave adventurer contacted by professor Wilson part of a group to protect elephants. Mokow\u00e9's local police contacted the professor about a network of poachers killing elephants systematically. The main character jumps on a plane to assist with the operation right away.</p>\n<p>The game uses mechanics similar to the author's previous title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/142432/la-secte-noire/\">La secte noire</a>. The game consists of several single-screen locations with exploration, picking up and using objects to solve puzzle and conversations with characters. The environment takes up the largest portion of the screen in the centre with a permanent background behind it. The top left corner shows possible movement options based on compass points. The top also holds boxes for the current date and time. The text parser where all commands are entered is at the bottom. Basic commands are entered for moving around, picking up items and performing actions. A separate key is used to display the inventory. Below the parser portion sentences appear to provide descriptions or feedback on the player's actions.</p>\n<p>A distinctive game element is the role of the time of day. Certain actions can be only be performed during the day or at night. One of the possible actions is \"attendre\" (wait) to make time pass. The game can be saved on a separate disk.</p>",

These pipes do not stay fixed, and may need to be revisited if they are not tightened sufficiently. While conducting your handy-man activities, you must avoid hazards including falling debris knocked loose by the earthquake, and rising water levels. On the above water decks, there may also be mutant anti-matter mice which can be kicked away if you get your timing right. A failed kick will give the rats an opportunity to deliver a fatal bite. </p>\n<p>Under water decks may be visited for a short period of time, but you only have just over a minute's worth of oxygen which can be replenished above the water. Once the water has reached the top of the screen, there is no way to avoid death. Each time spannerman dies, the level starts again from the beginning.</p>",

        "description": "<p>It is 1994, and the entire Earth has been invaded by aliens... almost. You control Macho, helicopter pilot extraordinaire, as he flies around the screen collecting the parts for the nine fighter planes whose assembly is Earth's last desperate hope.</p>\n<p>Chopper Squad is a game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Jetpac\">Jetpac</a>, where you must avoid alien nasties, collect parts of a plane that appear around the screen, and bring them back to an assembly point. The screen contains only three helicopter landing pads, and an assembly zone accessed by moving a carried plane part into the bottom right side of the screen. The helicopter can move left or right, and increase altitude. When not directly moving upwards, the copter slowly descends. </p>\n<p>The copter is also equipped with a \"photon proton lazer blazer\" with which to destroy enemies. Enemies can also be destroyed if they touch the top or the bottom of the screen. Vanquished enemies will be re-spawned from off-screen so that there are always four at any time. Aliens on earlier levels move about randomly, while later ones move more quickly and home in on your position.</p>\n<p>Plane components occasionally fall from the sky, with only one appearing at any given time. Once all of the plane pieces have been placed in the assembly area, the next level starts. The player starts with 4 lives, which can be lost on collision with an alien. Loss of all lives ends the game.</p>",

The player patrols the two-way scrolling landscape in his ship, disposing of six different types of aliens preventing them from abducting the humans. If the aliens manage to get a human to outer space (top of the screen), it mutates and takes after you. You can rescue the humanoid by shooting the alien capturing it, but if it falls too far it will meet its end. In that case you need to swoop in to pick it up and return it safely to the surface. At the end of level, each surviving human gives you a bonus score.  </p>\n<p>Your ship is equipped with lasers and a limited number of smart bombs and the the top of the screen is dedicated to a long range scanner that shows the location of all enemies and humanoids on the level.</p>\n<p>You start out with three lives. Each time you get hit by an enemy or an projectile you lose a live, once all lives are spent the game is over.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Aliens have invaded your spacecraft. For the good of humanity, you have decided to stop the aliens by destroying your ship. However the pieces needed to activate the self-destruct sequence have been scattered around your vessel. Your task is to collect all 12 explosive parts, assemble and activate them in the correct part of the ship, and then flee to the life-boat in the hope that you will eventually be rescued.</p>\n<p><em>Argo Navis</em> is a platform game set in a 96-room maze, connected by corridors and ramps. You can walk left or right, shoot, or jump over small gaps. You start the game with a certain amount of oxygen, which only decreases if you fall any distance, run into walls, or get hit by aliens (such as robot guards, spitters and weird spider-like creatures). Oxygen cylinders may be collected to replenish your air. </p>\n<p>As you explore the ship, you will find that many areas can only be accessed by pressing a button to activate a door, and there is some challenge in determining which order the doors should be opened. You may find stars to collect which increases your score. There is also a mini-game which is accessed any time you try to pass one of the special red firing portals dotted around the ship. When this happens, the ship comes under attack by another alien ship and you must move your cross-hair about to shoot at it. Once that ship has been obliterated, the game continues as normal.</p>",

The game environment displayed through a first-person perspective takes up about a third of the screen and it is shown in a rectangle in the top right part of the screen. On the left side there are three buttons that can be clicked (by moving a cursor shaped as a hand) to interact. Near the top left is the inventory.</p>\n<p>The main goal is figuring out a way to repair the space ship after being stranded on a planet. There is no linear path to follow and right from the start there is freedom of exploration. Progressing involves locating pieces and solving puzzles. Eventually a second, very different part of the game is reached with action sequences, puzzles with 2D-scrolling elements as well as navigating a 3D environment with real-time movement.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Contamination</em> is a world health simulation game, where the earth is invaded by unknown viruses from outer space.</p>\n<p>The player takes on the role of the World Health Center tasked with identifying the virus, creating an antidote and taking other measures to stop the virus from spreading. At the same time the player must not wear down morale of the world population, or risk a up-rising by the local population. When the population is out of control, it becomes impossible to order measures like a sanitary belt.</p>\n<p>The player must first take a sample of an infected region, then create an anti-virus by grabbing all the virus parts in a certain order. Next is the experimentation phase, to determine the probable effect of treatment but also the secondary observed effects. An antidote can have side effects such as dehydration, liquidation of the eyes, cancer of the lungs etc. When you treat the population with a highly toxic anti-virus with severe side effects the population reacts negatively.</p>\n<p>Other measures include a stop icon to put a sanitary belt in place, a fire icon to perform a terre brulee or scorched earth. The ultimate measure is to simply drop a nuclear explosion on a region, which results in an instant game over.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Star Avenger is a variant of the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Scramble\">Scramble </a>. You control a spaceship travelling across a horizontally scrolling landscape littered with obstacles of various types including missiles, planes, bats and force-fields. In some areas, the ceiling and floor topography also means careful piloting is needed to avoid a crash. Your aim is to make it past everything without hitting anything. Points can be earned by shooting some of the opponents.</p>\n<p>You have an energy gauge, which starts full but is depleted at a constant rate. Running out of fuel will lose a life, but shooting fuel tanks will replenish some of the lost energy. There is only one big level which repeats once you reach and destroy a reactor at the end. However you can start the game at any of a number of checkpoints. There is also a difficulty setting which may be selected (from 1-5) and affects the speed of the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Death Pit is a 2D scrolling platform game where you play as a treasure hunter, setting off on an underground expedition to recover gold and a priceless gem. The aim is to get as high a score as possible. Points are earned by finding valuables below ground, and returning them to your tent near the entrance of the pit.</p>\n<p>To survive the caverns, you will need a battery to power your torch and an oxygen cylinder to pass through water filled corridors. These slowly deplete with use, but you can carry back-ups (up to 4 items max) and fully charged replacements may be found on the surface. You may also carry a spade, which is needed to menace some of the creepy-crawlies that scuttle about the depths.</p>\n<p>There are twenty gold bars randomly scattered through the subterranean regions, but the gem is always in the same position. The game ends once a timer runs out, you have lost five lives or have returned to your tent with the gem.</p>",

Very simple looking, the game displays your score and your opponent's score. You can choose the 501 or 301 mode by pressing F1.</p>\n<p>To aim and to fire the dart use the joystick, then the player needs to put the cursor on the screen, but the aim isn't precise, it moves around and is purposely hard to control, so its necessary some skill to fire at the right time on the board. Like classic darts game, the dart can hit outside of the board and in the wire, meaning no points for you or your opponent.</p>\n<p>It is also part of a compilation of games titled \"Pub Games\" for the same platform (Amstrad CPC) and from the same year (1986).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Jet Paco</em> for Amstrad CPC is the fourth iteration of <em>Jet Paco</em>. It builds on the previous games in the series, but is not identical. The siblings Paco and Puri Rebollez are astronauts and their job is to gather energonia crystals, a material used to power spaceships. They get around using a jetpack. In this version of the game they detect an abandoned ship and investigate to look for crystals. Players get to choose between Paco or Puri at the start and there are three missions in total.</p>\n<p>The missions consist of several single-screen rooms connected vertically and horizontally so there is free exploration to collect the crystals in any order. The characters can fly around with an unlimited amount of fuel using a jet pack. Movement is based on thrust, so the player can either keep a button pressed to keep rising or use small taps to hover and navigate small passages. Unlike the previous games they cannot fly through platforms when approaching them from below. There are hazards and enemies in irregular patterns to avoid. The characters have no means to attack, the focus is on careful navigation using the jet pack mechanic. The HUD shows how many crystals are left to be found.</p>",

Improving your handicap will result in longer and more accurate shots on your next round.</p>\n<p>The game has a password system to allow players to continue to work on lowering their handicap over several sessions.</p>",

It is possible to rotate the chessboard by 90\u00b0 with each press of O key. You may change the colour of your pieces by V key. The voice synthesizer announces all the movements you make. If you would like to play silently, a short chime will alert you that the computer has made a move and now it is your turn to play.</p>\n<p>The program has two options: normal play and analysis. In normal play 7 levels are offered, from beginner, when computer responds very fast, to the \"correspondence game\" level where computer's respond may take up even to 24 hours. Among the different options of the game there are also possibilities to change sides or levels during the game or to stop the game to reposition the pieces. Additionally, by pressing the R key, the computer recommands you the best moves if it were in your place. The program accepts castling and in passing (en passant) capture.</p>",

You are the pilot of an intergalactic combat ship responsible for defending different sectors of the confederation, fighting against waves of powerfully-armed enemy ships.</p>\n<p>In addition to enemy spacecrafts, you will need to avoid burning meteorites and kamikaze ships. Some of the ships will try to attack you from behind, but your radar will show you the enemies' position. You can also explore the deep canyons or tunnels that criss-cross the planet. During your mission, you must refuel your ship by destroying the fuel cans placed on the ground. Of course, you should eventually destroy the enemy base.</p>\n<p>You can move to the sector that you must protect in order to intercept enemy units or to resupply on the surface of the planets. The bases are located on the surface of the planets. Each planet has a three-level defense system:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The magnetic shield: This is the most external protection.</li>\n<li>The energy screen: This is the intermediate protection.</li>\n<li>The force field: This is the last protection before reaching the ground of the planet. This level is the most resistant.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These three levels of protection may not be present together every time. To reach the ground of a planet, enemy units must cross all available defense levels on that planet. Once the ground of a planet has been reached, Advenez units will destroy the base (if there is one).</p>\n<p>The game has two levels:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The strategic level: this is the level where you choose the units that you are going to attack, the planets to defend as a priority, the moment when you are going to resupply, etc. The computer edge provides you with a radar map of the sector and information on enemy units present, on planets and on your interceptor.</li>\n<li>The action level: after choosing the units to intercept, you must eliminate them.</li>\n</ul>",

The game features 99 different layouts and you can choose which screen to begin on. Once you clear the map, you're given the choice of four exits each of which will whisk you to another level.  </p>\n<p>To help you on your way, you are armed with two pots of glue that you can drop on the floor and lure the chasing workers into them to hold them for a short period of time this can help you escape or get to an otherwise difficult to reach section of the scaffold. If things get desperate you can even chose to leap to the level below, assuming you can make it.  Once the strikers free themselves, your glue is replenished but you're also up against the clock so you need to balance the cautious approach with getting through the level.</p>",

As in the original game, it is the player's goal to collect all the gold pieces within a level, climbing ladders or handlebars, avoiding deadly falls, and outsmarting enemy guards. The guards can be temporarily trapped in holes that the player can dig. Unlike in the original, there is a time limit to every level.</p>\n<p>Also like the original game, <em>Halls of Gold</em> contains a level editor.</p>",
