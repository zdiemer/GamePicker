        "description": "<p><em>Pok\u00e9mon Pinball mini</em> is the second Pok\u00e9mon Pinball game. The game consists of 90 levels total. Diglett, Pikachu, Clefairy, Wobbuffet, and Poliwag are used as plungers, but the levels restrict which plungers are used. There are three modes: Quest, the main mode, has 70 levels. Capture levels are found only in Quest mode. Each level must be completed to unlock the next, unlike the other two modes. It consists mainly of Fill Hole and High Score levels. In Fill Hole levels the goal is to get a Pok\u00e9 Ball into each hole before the timer runs out. In High Sore levels, the goal is to race against the timer and surpass a minimum score. Getting a Pok\u00e9 Ball into a hole normally earns 1 point, and getting a Pok\u00e9 Ball into a hole with a power shot earns 3 points. Capture levels involve capturing the Pok\u00e9mon walking across the screen. Hitting it with Pok\u00e9 Balls reduces its HP, and when it faints, hitting it again will capture it. The player must shoot the now-heavier Pok\u00e9 Ball into the hole. Time Attack mode features 10 Fill Hole levels, all of which are immediately available. Score Attack mode features 10 High Score levels, all of which are, again, immediately available.</p>",

In Pikachu's Rocket Start, you play a Pikachu racing against various other Pok\u00e9mon. In Slowking's Judge you control a Slowking refereeing a tennis match and must make the right decisions. In Chansey's Dribble, you are a Chansey kicking a soccer ball, with the goal being to kick it to the finish line as quickly as possible. Bellossom's Dance puts you in control of a Bellossom trying to match the dance moves of two other Bellossom. In Hitmonchan's Boxing you are a Hitmonchan boxing with a Machop. Finally, in the two-player Sneasel's Fake Out, two Sneasel play basketball and try to decide who is offense and who is defense in a game of chance. There are two other functions: Battlefield, in which two to six players choose a one-player game and compete in it for the highest score, and Celebi's Clock, which is simply a clock with date, alarm, and stopwatch functions.</p>",

There are four game modes. Wild Match is for 1 to 5 players. The players must put matching cards down on the table in order to win coins. Whoever has the most coins at the end wins. Pairs aren't the only accepted matches, as there are many different combos that are worth more coins, like putting all three starter Pok\u00e9mon of Johto down. Special Seven is also for 1 to 5 players. Whoever gets rid of all their cards first wins. Players match cards by traditional suit or by Pok\u00e9mon on the table. Some cards also have special abilities to change suit, or other effects. Card Duel can only be played by 2 players via infrared connection. Both players have the same cards, and whoever plays the highest value card wins. Four Kings is 1 player only. It is like Solitaire, but the card piles must be in a specific order and topped off with the Magikarp card.</p>",

Two puzzles return: Motion Puzzle, where tiles are switch around to form the correct Pok\u00e9mon image, and Shadow Puzzle, where shapes are rotated and placed to form a Pok\u00e9mon's relative silhouette. There are also two new puzzles. In Pick-Up Puzzle, an arrangement of Pok\u00e9 Balls lies on the floor. The player's Pok\u00e9mon must clear them by moving over them in one line without isolating any of them. And in Stretch Puzzle, a grid is shown, with black and white boxes. The white boxes are empty, and the black boxes have numbers on them. The numbers represent bars that can be extended to take up the empty spaces. The goal is to fill up each empty space, meaning the placement of the bars is crucial to success.</p>",

Traditional controls are used rather than motion controls for movement, though the Pok\u00e9mon mini system's built-in tilt sensor is occasionally used for escaping when Togepi gets stuck in a hole. Togepi was peacefully walking through the forest when a Fearow noticed it. The Fearow grabs Togepi and takes it to its nest on the top of a tower. Togepi tries to escape, but trips on a pebble, and starts rolling around. The player must guide Togepi down the stairs. Many hazards exist, including bottomless pits, cracked floors, bumpers and many more too numerous to list. Sometimes, the stairs are covered by a door, and puzzles must be solved to open them, such as rolling over floor switches or knocking other Pok\u00e9mon into holes. At the end each tower is a boss Pok\u00e9mon, who is fought when they also trip on a pebble and start rolling. Boss arenas are small platforms surrounded by a bottomless pit. They must by rolled into and knocked into the abyss to be defeated.</p>",
