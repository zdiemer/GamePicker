Within the labyrinth there are five secrets that the player has to retrieve so that humans can be freed.</p>\n<p>The game is played from a first person perspective similar to other maze games of its time with the graphics being redrawn for every step taken. Next to the main view there is a map that shows the layout of the level and the locations of the labyrinth's guards. When coming across a guard the player has two options: fight or pay for passage. The fights are played from a top down perspective and involves hacking at the guard with a sword until it dies. The player will also come across various boxes: blue ones that contain the secrets and green ones that might contain gold or an element that can either take or give strength to the player or demand gold. When an elements wants gold it's possible to bargain but if the offer is too low the player might get killed.</p>",

It's a side scrolling shoot 'em up where the player has to fight off the forces of something called the Zelons and ultimately destroy their globe fortress which is supposed to stop their assault on the solar system. Like in the original Scramble, the plane automatically advances over a mountainous terrain and the player has to watch out for or shoot down missiles that are launched from the ground. Two weapons are available: a machine gun that shoots bursts of fire forward and bombs which are dropped towards the ground. Fuel is limited and the plane will crash if it runs out. It can be refilled by dropping bombs on fuel stations on the ground. In addition to missiles there are outer dangers such as asteroids, mines and different fighters.</p>",
