Combining more than four of the same colour launches \"refugee\" Puyos into the opponent's well, filling it up and disturbing the combo buildup.  Triggering chains of Puyos grants more points and more \"refugee\" Puyos, so careful planning is essential.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Following the successes of the PC versions in the Elder Scrolls series, Shadowkey mimics most of the hallmarks apparent in its PC variants. Shadowkey is a first-person action RPG that lets you do just about anything in the game world you want without being tied too tightly to a plot. </p>\n<p>Featuring 18 separate areas with 65 different monsters, this game is quite small in comparison to its bigger brothers. A wide range of classes can be chosen which follows through with what you'd expect from the series. Assassin, Barbarian, Spellsword, Rogue, Thief, etc give the player a wide variety of play styles. Aside from the 9 possible classes, you also have a choice of 8 different races, each with different strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n<p>The game is structured around missions and jobs you receive from characters in the game. Some will require you to kill a certain person or creature, while others will require you to find a certain item. As you progress through the game you will acquire more powerful equipment and spells to accomplish more difficult goals as you travel to new areas.</p>\n<p>The game also features blue-tooth connectivity to another n-gage for co-op play.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Pocket Kingdom</em> is a strategic MMORPG set in the fantasy world of Ulgress. The core gameplay mechanic is combining combat units into squadrons and sending them into battle during which you have no control. Units can be equipped with various armors and weapons, and their AI can be customized for different levels of attack and defense. Winning battles earns you loot and items. The items can be combined with other items and equipment to create new items with special powers. </p>\n<p>The game can be played both online and offline. When online the world map shows other players which you can interact with by sending text messages and engaging in battle. Online also features an auction mode where you can buy or sell units, items and equipment. The main difference when playing offline is the lack of other players. The world map in both cases is populated by cities and dungeons. </p>\n<p>The culture of leet-speak heavily influences Pocket Kingdom. The combat units are constantly uttering leet-speak during the battles, and even acknowledge their own existence in a game. The plot centers around players fighting for the #1 spot in the rankings after some griefers were banned from the game.</p>",

In the 3D races Spider-Man needs to move higher or lower between buildings to avoid obstacles. The 2D levels are more traditional: climbing walls and ceilings, slinging web at opponents, taking pictures for the Daily Bugle newspaper, using spider sense to reveal secrets etc. The events are loosely based on the story of the <em>Spider-Man 2</em> movie. The game offers fifteen 2D levels, five 3D levels, some Spider-Man comics' classical villains as bosses (like The Lizard, Rhino, and Doc Ock) and a scoreboard on N-Gage Arena.</p>",

The player controls Bomberman and views the non-scrolling playfield from a top-down perspective. Besides the player character, there are three important other elements on the field: non-destructible blocks, destructible blocks and enemies which kill Bomberman when they touch him. </p>\n<p>The player can lay bombs which explode after a few seconds and destroy blocks and enemies in a certain blast radius. While the goal is to kill all enemies within a time limit, Bomberman will also find power-ups which improve his abilities, e.g. laying more bombs at once, a bigger blast radius or speed increase. After death, which can also be caused by the own bombs, all upgrades are lost. An exception are items found in bonus stages which can be entered when the secret condition for each world is fullfilled, e.g. in the first world is is necessary to defeat the boss without laying a bomb.</p>\n<p>Besides single-player (eight worlds with four levels plus one boss stage each) there are also five multiplayer maps where two players can fight each other. In multiplayer, there is an exclusive power-up which has negative effects on the player.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>ONE</em> is a one-on-one 3D fighting game. The story is about a tournament where fighters enter to come out on top and become \"the one\". At the start a custom fighter can be designed with options to alter the appearance through gender, face and skin colour, haircut, and outfit (top, bottom, footwear, gloves, accessories). Single-player games can be played in a Story, Survival, Training and Versus mode. The player can fight with only one type of character, but new moves are unlocked gradually by progressing through the Story mode, along with more customization options.</p>\n<p>The fighting system with punches, kicks and combos is based on three stances (offensive, neutral and defensive) that can be switched on the fly. The poses determine the movement (quick, medium, slow), types of attack (quick and powerful combos, mixed strikes and some combos, and quick but weak strikes), defense (dodging, blocking and deflecting, and very easy blocking), and grip (one-hand grab for offensive and neutral, two-hand grab for defensive). The offensive pose is also the only one that allows for a counterattack after dodging.</p>\n<p>The player's performance through the game is calculated through an ELO level that defines the progression. The Training mode is used to practice, in Survival the player has to defeat as many fighters as possible with one life and limited time, and Versus is one-on-one games against an AI opponent where it is possible to choose the opponent, make it a rated game or not, and define the rounds, time and enemy health. Opponents include bikers, boxers, clubbers, goths, kickboxers, punks, rappers, soldiers and more. Multiplayer against another player is supported through Bluetooth. The player's ELO score can be uploaded using the N-Gage Arena feature to compare rankings worldwide.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>MLB Slam!</em> is an MLB-licensed baseball game that offers six game modes. It uses the MLB statistics of the 2003 season based on the league standings as of 26th August of that year and all 30 teams. In Quick Match a quick game can be played with randomly assigned teams. Spring Training is similar, but there the teams can be chosen. Full Season is the main game mode with a season 162 games. It follows the 2003 schedule and includes all inter-league games and the World Series. A season is started with an opening day MLB roster or a dream team. A dream team can be used in all games modes except for exhibition games. A dream team is built starting with a $45,000 budget for a 15-person roster including at least three pitchers and one player for each position. Players can still be bought or sold afterwards and money is earned based on the performance. During a season statistics change based on the performance. Games can be simulated to move quicker and tactics include setting the batting order and field lineup.</p>\n<p>The three remaining game modes are World Series, Homerun Derby and 2 Player Game. World Series takes a team immediately to the World Series for the conclusion without having to play an entire season. Homerun Derby is a game of three rounds where two team take turns hitting the ball out of the park. After ten outs the teams switch positions. 2 Player Game is a local competitive multiplayer game using Bluetooth. There are three difficulty levels.</p>\n<p>As in most baseball titles a game is split up into different phases, each with their own controls for hitting, running, pitching and fielding. However, outfield and base running are left almost entirely under the control of the computer. Hitting a ball is done by moving a target into a strike zone where the pitch will cross the plate while simultaneously timing the swing button. While pitching a small selection of pitches is offered, along with moving a target in the strike zone and timing a power meter to determine the speed.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Operation Shadow</em> is a third-person run-and-gun shooter set shortly after the Cold War. The player controls the commando Jay Solano, part of a covert Special Forces team of the United Nations, deployed to defuse situations where escalation can lead to global military conflicts. The game starts in the fictitious Arawas region fighting Ixan forces and other regions are visited later on. Next to general Barton leading Team Shadow, other important characters are Ma\u00eblys Nyx, leader of the Midnight Wraiths mercenary outfit, General Neva, the political and military leader of the Rodan nation state, and CPN news network anchor woman Samantha Brown. There are four factions in total in the game: Ixan Desert Scorpions, Loxos Red Moon Army, Midnight Wraiths, and Rodan Snow Wolves. Next to moving on foot in the infantry mode, Solano can enter different types of crafts and vehicles during missions, such as a Humvee, a chopper, a hovercraft or a tank, each with very different controls and means. The Humvee can be used to take control over a mounted machine gun, the chopper uses a machine gun and missiles and the tank has both turrets and missiles.</p>\n<p>The game is in 3D and the action is always shown from a third-person behind view. The linear levels have different objectives and a red marker on the compass near the top of the screen shows the general direction. Solano needs to move and strafe while shooting enemy forces while moving on foot. The assault rifle has an unlimited amount of ammo, while grenades and antitank missiles are used to take out larger targets. Vehicles and crafts need to be exited before the explode and there is a general health meter for Solano as well. Using the tank or the chopper it is possible to lock on and shoot missiles. Pick-ups include health, armour, grenades, double damage, invincibility and frenzy. There are also ammo pick-ups for the Gatling gun, bazooka, tank shells, multi-rocket launcher, chopper rockets and Hellfire missiles.</p>\n<p>The singe-player mode is split up into different campaigns with multiple missions each, provided by general Barton. The game supports competitive multiplayer games on four maps through Bluetooth for up to four players.</p>",

There are twenty one different civilizations to choose from, and generally the list of features is the same. There's a full Civilopedia and tutorial available as well.</p>\n<p>Unlike most of other N-Gage titles, there are no multiplayer features in <em>Civilization</em>.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Call of Duty for N-Gage is a first foray of the hugely popular FPS series into the handheld world. It's not a straightforward port of an original 2003 game, as the set of levels and the engine used are different, accommodated for the restrictions of the mobile device. The basic idea is still the same: alone or with the help of your comrades shoot Nazis and complete objectives in a war-torn Europe during World War 2. As in the original campaign, here you can also partake in the action as U.S., British or a Russian soldiers during various missions.</p>\n<p>The game follows the basic concepts of a 3D Shooter, just as the \"bigger\" Call of Duty: players can run, look up and down, use ironsights, array of WW2 weaponry and help of their squadmates to an extent. Plus, in Call of Duty fashion you sometimes take up a role of a tank commander. There are eleven maps in total, plus some that are used in multiplayer games that could support up to four players via Bluetooth connection.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Requiem of Hell is an action-RPG game exclusive to Nokia N-Gage, and the closest thing to Diablo you can get on this platform. It has isometric graphics, hack'n'slash action, hordes of deformed monsters, and of course, Hell. </p>\n<p>The game starts in a village that has been attacked and ransacked by demonic troops, and your character is among the slaughtered ones. The magical fairy and a mysterious shaman brings them back from the dead to fight their cause.</p>\n<p>Action is done a bit differently from the Blizzard hit, as you may not only attack, but make combos, also use special moves depending on a weapon in hand, block enemy hits, which might be essential, and cast several types of magical spells. The character only has a health bar and instead of stamina there are cool-down timers for magical attacks like in MMORPGs. </p>\n<p>The roleplaying system is a simplified one as you level up mostly automatically, magical skills get more powerful the more they are used. The fairy accompanies the player during the journey, and can help him with an advice or slightly heal him if health gets very low. Hit points could also be restored with various food that lies around on the map.</p>\n<p>There are also two multiplayer modes: one is for cooperative play, and another one that allows two characters to battle against each other.</p>",

        "description": "<p>King of Fighters: Extreme is a mobile chapter in a long-running 2D fighting game series that first appeared in 1994. N-Gage version follows the most rules and has the most features of the arcade game. There are twenty one character to choose from to battle CPU or a human opponent in several game modes. Graphically it's not as richly detailed as arcade or console versions, as backgrounds lack animation, sprites in this version are much smaller as well as there are black bars on top and bottom of the screen to make game screen look wider. </p>\n<p>Among the game modes there are practice, survival, story and a battle which is a versus mode played via Bluetooth. Story lets you play through the ladder ending with a boss with three of your chosen brawlers. In tradition of King of Fighters, you don't go in a fight alone, but choose several characters, where after defeat of one another goes into the arena. The opposite party also got several brawlers at hand. And by pressing a button you can summon your backing character to help you a little bit mid-fight. </p>\n<p>Every character has their own martial style and set of special moves. There's also a \"max\" move, where one first needs to fill up a meter, scoring hits to use it, that's in turn lets you unleash a series of powerful attacks. The list of key combos could be handily summoned at any time by pressing pause, as well as controls could be redefined even in the heat of battle. All of the basic moves could be accessed by pressing assigned buttons due to N-Gage twelve-key phone keyboard.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Warhammer 40,000 is a scifi-fantasy tabletop tactics game famed for its' elaborate rules and grotesque detailed figurines. Warhammer 40,000: Glory in Death, unlike many licensed WH titles, is an attempt to bring that type of tabletop gameplay into the digital realm, in that case to N-Gage.</p>\n<p>There are four different factions to play with: Space Marines, Orcs, Eldar (think High Elves) and Chaos Space Marines, plus four sub-factions for each of them. All parties has their set of infantry and armor units (more than 60) with different roles, stats and attacking powers, that could be upgraded. There are campaigns with a storyline told through comicbook-like cutscenes for each of them as well. And a skirmish mode that lets you tune what type of a mission you'd like to play, select the map size, AI-mastery level, type of an environment and such. And there's multiplayer mode as well, that could be played either one a single device on turn-by-turn basis, or via Bluetooth with other N-Gage devices.</p>\n<p>The game plays pretty much as a typical turn-based tactics/strategy, however with specific Warhammer 40k rules applied. For example moving phase and shooting phase are separated, as well as an assault phase that lets you send your troops into hand-to-hand fight, that will keep the enemy squads busy. Commanders can be assigned to lead squads, some units can infiltrate enemy positions and etc. The battlefield is separated into several equal sector and the goal is usually to keep it under your control as attacking or defending side by the end of turn limit. Another important difference is that you can choose to deploy some units into battlefield at separate turns to reinforce the you forces where it's needed. The battles are shown as a set of animated cut-scenes, like it was done with Panzer General or Battle Island series.</p>\n<p>Since the game rules are a plenty there's a multi-chapter tutorial for general gameplay, and separate chapters for any of the three remaining factions to learn about their specifics and features, that are different from the default Space Marines.</p>",

        "description": "<p>System Rush is a futuristic racing game with strong hints of Wipeout series. Though the goal is the same as in any other racer - to finish in a first place, you don't pilot a physical vehicle in it, but a virtual one inside one of the four world global network. And your opponents are also programs and defense systems, as well as opposing hackers whose net you are trying to crack.</p>\n<p>The game sports a striking visual look mixing hints of futuristic Wipeout design, low-poly tracks as in F-Zero and neon vector graphics reminiscent of the early 80s arcade games and the movie Tron. Each one of the four networks - European, Russian, South American and United States has their distinctive color schemes, musical tracks, track layouts and also different flyers. Vehicles has four different parameters: speed, drift, handling and aero. While, the first three are obvious, the last one is quite unique, as each one of the flyers can take off and glide for some time. It could be used to avoid obstacles, gather power-ups and take over your enemies.</p>\n<p>At first, you only race against the simple programs that are not very competitive and could be destroyed by collision or by sucking their energy. However, at later stages more advanced bots are introduced, as well as other hacker vehicles that can pick up bonus items laying around the track and are harder to break down. Also, as the game progresses you'll find defense systems on the tracks, such as barriers, portals, firewalls that could impede your progress and destroy your flyer.</p>\n<p>Beside the story mode, where the goal is to hack each of the four global networks, there are also more typical Grand Prix tournament, single races and a multiplayer game, where up to four player can compete.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Roots: Gates of Chaos is an action role playing game set in a fantasy world. It is designed much like Diablo or many more similar ARPGs: there's a small hub, a peaceful town, and several pathways leading to the \"wilderness\" locations, where you encounter monsters and go to fulfill quests.</p>\n<p>In town you could shop, travel to a different location (there are five towns in The Roots), learn some local news, get quests or enter a gladiator arena. The tasks you can get are mostly kill or fetch quests typical for many ARPGs and MMORPGs that can provide you with valuable items in case you succeed and also do it before a deadline, as all of them are time-limited.</p>\n<p>To add interest and replayability there is a randomly generated loot system, such as also in many more RPGs. The items you get come with different stats, that could improve your character's primary abilities, like strength or agility, add damage or raise the defenses and magical resistance. The rarer the item the more modifiers and higher they are, but also such items require certain character level to wield them.</p>\n<p>The role playing system consists of a set of primary stats, usable skills and passive talents specific for each of the five character classes. Skills could be equipped and used on the game map: there are things like empowered attacks as rain of arrows, or something more original when for limited amount of time you could transform into an a giant spider that will let you bruteforce your way around.</p>\n<p>The visual style is somewhat cartoonish in appearance as in another Blizzard game - Warcraft III.Besides the single player mode, it's possible to play together with up to four player characters on the same in-game locations. And at the same time on the arena you can challenge them to a fight.</p>",

In general it follows the same rules as a console release: it's an American football \"simulator\" where you can choose a team from a vast roster corresponding with 2003 season, pick strategies from a number of offensive and defensive plays and then command your players on the field. Also you can take a look at some of the historical teams and games. But there are a few differences. </p>\n<p>The first and most obvious one is graphics -  the N-Gage game has a totally different graphical engine: instead of a fully 3D world, only the field is polygonal and sprites are used for the players models, thus making it more close to the sports games of the 90s. Secondly, Dynasty mode that lets you customize the team, build programs and recruit new members is absent, instead there are only quick play and season modes. Also, there's a one-on-one Bluetooth multiplayer and a bowl game called Nokia Sugar Bowl National Championship.</p>",

        "description": "<p>X-Men: Legends is an action-RPG with a twist: instead of controlling a sole protagonist, you run around with a whole party of four heroes, where player can control one of them at a time, while the other three are directed by the AI. You can also select different members into your party from a list of 11 mutants from Professor Xavier School for Gifted, including such iconic characters as Cyclops, Wolverine, Storm and so on. Some characters could be unlocked at later stages.</p>\n<p>The game story starts with a discovery of new young mutant, Alison, who has a powerful ability - a control over the Earth's magma layer. And human-hating Brotherhood of Mutants is quick to try to capture her to enlist into their numbers. X-Men manage to fight them off only to discover it was also just a part of their plot - to free their leader, an evil mastermind called Magneto from his long-term imprisonment.</p>\n<p>The game plays as many traditional ARPGs with an emphasis on direct control and action, though at any time you can pause the game and go to your inventory, skill or character menu to manage something. Every mutant has four primary battle skills that command their unique abilities plus some that are shared among all of them. It could be anything from Cyclops' optic beam, Gambits' deck of cards or Storms' massive tornado attack. Besides the skills that require energy all of them could engage in a simple melee fight.</p>\n<p>The N-Gage release shares many similarities to a PC and console game from Raven Software, however the graphic engine and in-game perspective are totally different - instead of fully 3D, almost top-down view, Barking Lizards version has a traditional isometric view with a prerendered world. There are 24 missions in a whole and the game features voice-overs and has some FMV cutscenes from the \"bigger\" edition. X-Men: Legends could be played either in single player mode or in cooperative multiplayer.</p>",

This time both X-Men and Brotherhood of Mutants have to work together against a common enemy - Apocalypse, one of the first mutants to walk the Earth and also exceptionally powerful one. He wants not only to crush humanity but his fellow mutants as well and starts with a large scale attack on Genosha, a mutant controlled island nation. </p>\n<p>The N-Gage version is still an isometric four character strong action RPG where all have got a set of unique passive and active abilities, but now there are more characters to choose from, including the past villains from the other side such as Toad or Scarlet Witch and some of the new heroes can fly too. Rise of Apocalypse is slightly less linear with more optional objectives and. Now there's a currency system which means you can also purchase equipment, mostly usable items, like smelling salts or energy packs in the camp, though there are also equipable items such as belts, body armor and gloves.</p>\n<p>The game could be played by up to four players online, and as new feature there's a turn based player versus player mode on smaller locations, where more characters could be purchasing with in-game currency.

Resources could be either purchased for Settlement cards or traded with other players.</p>\n<p>The N-Gage version besides the traditional board game rules, also features a multi-stage tournament and a quest-mode with a number of different objectives, like building the longest road or having the largest army, by the end of the game, or reaching ten points under a certain amount of turns. Most of the in-game actions are decided by the roll of dice and it is done automatically. There are ten different computer characters who has their own portraits and things they say during the game, if you are playing alone. Of course, there's a multiplayer option for up to four players as well. Also there's a short tutorial to grasp the strategy basics.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>WWE Aftershock</em> is a wrestling game featuring real fighters and arenas licensed from World Wrestling Entertainment. One of the major differences from the previous handheld adaptations is that it is done in 3D. There are ten superstars in total such as Chris Jericho, John Cena or Booker T, plus two could be unlocked using the N-Gage Arena online service. This feature is now no longer available as Nokia has abandoned the platform.</p>\n<p>The action takes place in and out of the ring and the goal is to force your opponent to submit, usually by beating them to a pulp before that. There are a multitude of moves starting with simple kicks and punches to more sophisticated grapples, throws and counter strikes. Weapons could also be picked up used sometimes. And unique to each fighter there are Smackdown moves, which when performed are shown in a cinematic manner. To activate them player needs to fill up a gauge by smacking his opponent for some time.</p>\n<p>Other elements that were licensed are the introduction walks and musical themes, which are unique for each of the wrestlers. Included game modes are Survival, King of the Ring, Tag Team and several Main Event ones that are one-on-one matches. There is a versus multiplayer option available as well via Bluetooth connection.</p>",

Due to the lack of better prospects, player assumes the role of a courier who has to find and deliver the valuable minerals, and on the way back has to fight off gangs of marauders and other delivery workers who'd like to get their hands on his payload. There's a story mode in the game which is told through the comic-like cut-scenes.</p>\n<p>What puts Payload aside from many racing games is an open-world approach to level design, instead of a set of fixed linear tracks. On those levels or arenas the player could traverse in a hovercraft, pick up the minerals, race or fight the enemies, pick up power-ups and such. There are 11 different \"skims\" as the vehicles are called in the game and 10 worlds to explore. The looks and loadouts could be customized between the stages.</p>\n<p>Graphically it is a combination of 3D landscapes and vehicles, and 2D objects, such as debris or boulders on the map. Besides the single player mode, there's a four player multiplayer option via Bluetooth. N-Gage Arena features included unlockable vehicles, uploadable rankings and customizable race conditions.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This is a traditional RPG game with turn-based tactical combat based on the pen and paper role-playing system called Rifts. The system is quite eclectic and is somewhat similar to Shadowrun, though it also deals with post-apocalyptic, horror and western elements. Due to the massive nuclear war at the end of the XXI century and deaths of the millions and subsequent disasters result in a huge release of the magical energy that happens to activate a system of mythical ley lines. Usually hidden from the eyes of humanity, now they've become visible and powerful and created a number of \"rifts\" leading to parallel worlds and other dimensions. Many alien beings from different worlds got sucked in and transported to Earth, forcing them to co-exist with humans - from fantasy races to vampires, demons, mutants and many others. The story of the game starts several hundred years after the beginning of those events: you are a prisoner on the run from the group called Dead Boys, and first thing you have to do is remove the ugly tattoo from your face that marks you as someone's escaped property.</p>\n<p>The game begins with a character creation - you can choose from the three proto classes, that later could be evolved into a more sophisticated and narrowed versions. The classes are mercenary - a specialist in technology, psychic that deals with power of the mind, and mage that feeds from the magic-filled world. The roleplaying system uses a set of primary stats like in DnD, Shadowrun or GURPS and a set of dependable skills spread into categories like technical, personal, military, magical and so on. </p>\n<p>The game goes in real-time, but when a fight is bound to happen it goes into turn-based mode governed by action points and character's initiative. During the combat both skills and weapons of your party could be used, terrain also plays a role and various objects like propane tanks could be used as well.</p>\n<p>The visual style is a mix of 3D maps and sprite characters, and as an uncommon feature you can rotate the view by the 90 degrees to get a better look at the surroundings. Rifts also boasts online functionality - there are several multiplayer modes such as King of the Hill and Capture the Flag that could be played both locally via Bluetooth or through N-Gage Arena service, which was closed after Nokia ceased supporting the platform.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Puzzle Bobble VS</em> is an N-Gage-exclusive installment in the long-running puzzle series. Unlike most entries, it does not feature solo puzzle levels but (as indicated by the title) only the competitive variant of the game.</p>\n<p>The game can be played in single-player story mode or as a multi-player game for up to four players via bluetooth connection. In the story mode, series hero Bubblen (aka Bub in most US releases of the series) must recapture six stolen diamonds from bad guy Drunk and his minions. It consists of six consecutive one-on-one stages arranged on a map of Rainbow Island. Three difficulty settings are available, with a special ending only becoming available upon finishing the hardest level.</p>\n<p>Gameplay follows the standard template of the series: at the start of a level, differently colored bubbles fill part of the play field. The players control a launcher at the bottom that can be aimed in any direction and shoots bubbles of random colors. When three or more bubbles of the same color touch, they are removed from the field, with any unattached bubbles falling away. Removing bubbles adds them to the opponents' fields. After a while, more bubbles fill in from the top, pushing the existing bubbles downward. A player loses when the bubbles reach the bottom of their field. Special power-ups are available via a bubble gauge, which fills when removing a certain amount of bubbles at once. Once the gauge is full, the powers can be unleashed at the press of a button.</p>",
