Due to the limitations of the screen the pinball table isn't actually shown, but the points scored are. There are 8 point scoring devices on the screen such as roll overs, thumpers, spinner gates, kick out holes, drop targets, etc. When the game is started the number of remaining balls is shown, after which the player can shoot the ball. Numbers are shown indicating which device is hit and how many points are scored. If -1 or -3 is displayed the player must type 1 or 3 quickly to use the flipper to bounce it back. This must be done quickly. When -2 is shown the ball is going down the middle and cannot be stopped, the player can try to tilt the machine by pressing 2 with a two out of three chance of avoiding a ball loss. When the ball does go out the bonus score is displayed. If zero points are scored no ball is subtracted and the player earns an extra ball at 50,000 points.</p>",
