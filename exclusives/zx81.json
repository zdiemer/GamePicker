After being introduced to the game by a circus crier, the player character is transferred to a randomly generated 16x16 maze and has to find the exit. There is but one difficulty: There is a Tyrannosaurus Rex hidden in the maze. As soon as the protagonist moves, the dinosaur will begin to chase him, getting more and more active the nearer he gets. The T. Rex's state is indicated in the status bar, letting the player know if he is still far away (\"Rex lies in wait\"), if he's approaching (\"Footsteps approaching\") or if the player should really get a move on (\"RUN! He is behind you\"). The protagonist can run quicker than the dino, but many are the adventurers that took a wrong turn or came to a dead end. The exit, of course, lies at such a dead end and is only visible from a few steps distance.</p>",

The aim of the game is to evacuate humanoids from the surface of a moon. From a mothership at the top of the screen, the player drops down lunar modules that he has to safely land on the moon's three landing platforms. This works similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Lunar+Lander\">Lunar Lander</a> but here the player has to navigate his way through an asteroid storm. The player can steer left and right and use the thrust to hover in the air. Once the player has landed successfully the humanoids will enter the module and the player takes off again. But now the scenario has changed. Above him he will find waves of aliens that drop bombs. To survive the player has to dodge the alien ships and make it back to the mothership. Now thrust isn't available any more. Instead the player can use a gun to shoot at the aliens. </p>\n<p>There are six groups of humanoids. The player gets points for each successful landing and each alien shot down. When the last humanoid has been rescued the player gets bonus points for every one he has managed to bring back. Bonus points are also awarded based on the amount of fuel that remains. For each group that has been rescued the game goes on with increased difficulty and bonuses.</p>",

The player controls a laser base at the bottom of the screen and has to shoot at the centipede-like aliens that appear at the top of the screen and then crawls towards him. Unlike the Atari game the player can only move left and right and not up and down. Neither does it feature any mushrooms. Instead there are only a few obstacles that stop the centipedes and make them change direction. When a centipede is shot it splits into two halves. The player must shoot all segments before they reach the baseline. If they do the player loses a base. The number of bases is user defined (1 to 5) and so is the movement speed of the centipedes. Another feature not present in the arcade game is that the centipedes can drop bombs at the player.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Galactic Gunner</em> is a shooting game where the player has to shoot down as many ships from an enemy space fleet as possible. The game is viewed from a first person perspective and it involves moving around a crosshair and then pressing the fire button when an enemy ship flies past it. The firing is not instant so the player has to anticipate the enemy's position. Space is full of dust clouds that the player's shots won't penetrate and when the enemy ship hides beneath them they have to wait it out. One enemy appears on screen at a time and when killed another will take its place. The game goes on till either the time runs out or the player has used all the 25 shots they have at their disposal. The player can choose between five skill levels and the scoring is dependent on this. Higher skill levels mean faster enemies and less time available. For each enemy shot down the player earns 10 times the skill level.</p>",

But now a rescuing attempt is under way. A group of alien soldiers try to evacuate their masters by hyperspacing into the scene and breaking down the walls of the jail. It's of course up to the player to stop them and defend the jail. </p>\n<p>The game is a fixed screen shoot 'em up. The player controls a stellar missile base at the bottom of the screen and above him is the jail. Similar to other early shooters like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a> the player can move left and right and shoot up against the enemies. The enemies teleport into the screen one at a time and they then bounce around the screen as if they were balls from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Breakout\">Breakout</a>. As they hit the jail they will remove one piece of its walls at a time until the holes are big enough for the generals to escape. The player scores for each enemy he hits; 20 points for soldiers and 50 points for generals. When generals are hit they turn into three soldiers. The player also has to watch out for the bombs that the generals drop.</p>",

Rather than having keys for up, down, left and right, they here lead to diagonal moves (for example up and left, down and right).

The buildings can however only be entered when their doors are opened. From the sky, meteorites are falling and the player has to avoid being hit by these while moving across the screen. Getting hit means a life is lost. Other things falling from the sky are pills that give an extra life when eaten and bricks that when caught builds or repairs one of three protection buildings (similar to the shields in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a>).

Rampaging hordes of kamikaze aliens are attacking the earth and of course it's up to the player to shoot them down before they crash into the surface. What sets Astro Invaders variants apart from other shoot 'em ups is that the aliens position themselves in columns after entering the screen. As the columns fill up with aliens, they begin to descend until they explode upon hitting the ground. If in range of the explosion, the player will die. In addition to these normal aliens, there are neutron bombers whose explosion range covers the full screen and therefore has to be shot down. The player has three lives.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Bat Cage</em> is an action game where the player has to capture bats while fighting off other bats that try to rescue them. The playing field consists of a bat cage in the bottom and above it a bat flap around and there are also eight bat eggs bouncing around. The player controls a bar that can be moved around freely. It is used to capture the bat eggs which are taken to the bat cage where they can hatch. As soon as the hatching begins the bat at the top of the screen will attack and try to rescue the egg. The player then has to use the bar to fend it off. It works a bit similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Breakout\">Breakout</a> as the bat will bounce back up again when it makes contact with the bar. The player then scores points as long as the egg hatches. Ultimately the attacking bat will give up and retreat and the player can move on to the next egg that needs to be captured. </p>\n<p>As the game goes on the player will reach bonus levels and the number of attacking bats will increase. The game is over when the bats stay at the top of the screen and no longer attack when the player hatches his eggs. The game can be set to different skill levels (1-36) that alters the speed of the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Rocket Man</em> is a platformer where the player has to collect diamonds. The diamonds are located on the far left side of the screen and the player starts out to the right. The right side consists of platforms and ladders but to get to the diamonds the player will need a jetpack to fly across the gap that separates them from the rest of the screen. To use the jetpack the player first has to collect fuel cans which appear in random positions. Once the gauge indicates there is enough fuel in the tank the player can pick up the jetpack and go get the diamonds. When the fuel runs out the player has to go back and collect more fuel. Beneath the platforms are water that the player has to avoid. There is also a bubble that moves around the screen trying to catch the player. When it succeeds it drags the player down into the water. Contact with water leads to a lost life. </p>\n<p>The game consist of six levels each with a different platform layout. On the first three levels the bubble gets increasingly better at homing in on the player, making the game harder. On levels 4 to 6 the jetpack is replaced by a vulture and instead of collecting fuel the player has to collect lamb legs to feed the vulture.</p>",

The concept of the original game is turned on its head as here the player controls a ghost who is chased by pac-men. The gameplay works the same though as the player has to collect all the dots in the maze while avoiding the pac-men. There is one difference though. Ghosts obviously doesn't have lives, instead the player has a spirit meter. Spirit decrease when the player makes contact with the enemies. This means there's no instant deaths but the game is over when all spirit is gone.</p>",

Little of the dungeon is shown when starting so the player has to explore to find the exit and move on to the next level in the dungeon. Sometimes it's necessary to dig tunnels through walls to move forward.</p>\n<p>The player only has one statistic, strength, and it constantly decreases. When it reaches zero the player dies and has to start over in a new dungeon. To increase the strength the player has to collect food. The dungeons are full of monsters that the player can engage in combat. Battles are automatic and the only option available for the player is to run away. The outcome of battles depend on strength as it decreases for each hit. Winning a battle leads to an increase in strength. There are also traps to watch out for. When stepping on one, the player has five chances to guess a number and if he or she succeeds, they will be saved. The player can also come across phantoms which can be paid to increase strength.</p>",

At their disposal, the player has their Svlegian Raider which is moved across the bottom of the screen while shooting at the enemies above. The enemies begin at the sides of the screen and move towards the centre where supply pods are located. The pods are protected by barriers that the aliens will remove one piece at a time. Once they have made a hole through they can take the pods and transport them back to the edge of the screen. The player has to prevent them from doing this by shooting them down in time, at the same time watching out for their fire. Some protection is offered by four <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a>-esque shields. The player has three lives and loses one when shot or when the aliens recover a pod. Before a game, one of three game speeds can be chosen.</p>",

Like that game it is a platformer where the player uses a jetpack to fly between platforms. The objective of the game is to collect fuel cells that appear at random positions on the right side of the screen. These then have to be transported back to the player's flying saucer which is located on the left side. In the way there are plenty of hazards and bad guys that the player has to avoid. These include spiders, skulls, pests and nettles. The player also can't take too long as he has a limited supply of air. Another way of dying is crashing into a platform with the jetpack. The game has five levels that can be played in any order.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dungeon of Ymir</em> is a dungeon crawling RPG where the player has to find the sacred Sword of Kaslo. The dungeon consists of multiple levels connected with stairs that the player has to explore. There are plenty of monsters that will come in the hero's path and the combat with these is automatically performed when contact is made. Once the battle has started it can not be cancelled. If healing potions are available they will be automatically used in combat when needed. Hit points lost will automatically recharge after battle. Defeating a monster leads to an increase in experience points and ultimately the player will level up. Some of the monsters that the player will encounter are minotaurs, archers, birdmen, dire wolves, three-legged gremlins and ghastly ghouls.</p>\n<p>Various objects can be found around the corridors of the dungeon. This includes gold, spell vials, lamps and mysterious chests. There are also temples that the player can visit. A few different kinds of spell can be cast: drift, shield, teleport and invoke rejuvenation. The player can also use healing potions. Sometimes the player might stumble upon an oracle who might help the player.</p>",

It takes place long ago in a galaxy far away where a war between two hostile races took place. Prisoners taken could not expect to survive for long and their only hope lay with the Xtricators, a group of warriors whose job it was to rescue people from the enemy's home planet.</p>\n<p>The player takes control of a member of the Xtricators called Zed and has to collect all members of his group that have been captured. To pick up a prisoner the player has to move down close to the surface without hitting the ground. Due to the planet's gravitational pull the player can't stay close to the surface too long since the ship will then explode. At the same time the player has to fight the enemy fighters that try to stop him. Two weapons are available: a regular laser cannon and a super zapper bomb that destroys all enemies on the screen. The bombs have to be used sparingly as there are only three in supply. Occasionally a mother ship will appear which must be hit four times with the laser. The player has a limited amount of fuel but after rescuing all prisoners the player returns home for a refill before the game continues with another tougher stage.</p>",

Therefore he sets off to the mines of Cornwall where he searches for that perfect diamond. The goal for each of the game's 32 levels is to unlock the exit by collecting a certain number of diamonds. At the same time Bradford has to avoid the boulders that will fall down on him if he digs a path under them. There are also various roaming creatures that have to be avoided. Theses monsters can be killed with falling boulders and sometimes diamonds will take their place. In some levels the player has to collect keys to be able to reach diamonds that have been locked away. There is also a time limit to mind.</p>",

Controls are simple with buttons for steering left and right as well as accelerating and braking. There are two game modes: survival and speed race. In the survival mode the car automatically moves forward at a steady pace (starting at 160 mph) and the player has to avoid crashing by steering left and right. For each lap survived the speed increases by 4 mph. In the speed game the player races against the clock and has to complete ten laps in the best possible time. When crashing the speed drops to zero and the player has to start accelerating again. The game has eight different race tracks.</p>",

Beneath it are columns which the aliens enter before they attack the player. When hitting the ground the aliens explode and the player has to stay out of their blast radius. In addition to the regular aliens there is also a larger kind that appears in the middle of the screen. When this one hits the ground its blast radius covers the whole ground and therefore it has to be shot down. The game is over when all three lives have been lost.

At the same time he has to watch out for the meanies (black squares with eyes) that chase him. By collecting power pills the meanies become edible but only for a short time. The player has three lives and earns another one after scoring 10,000 points. Pills are worth ten points each and for every meanie eaten the points double with first one being worth 200.

        "description": "<p><em>Alien</em> is a game inspired by the movie with the same name but without a license. The game takes place aboard the transport ship Nostrodamus and the player's objective is simply to destroy the alien. The game is viewed from a top down perspective where the whole ship is visible. The player character and the alien are represented by flashing squares although the alien is only visible when within ten moves from the player. The player can also see various letters that represent weapons although the player won't know which weapon is which before picking them up. To attack the alien the player has to pick up a weapon and then use it in the direction of the alien. The player can only carry one weapon at a time and won't know what effect it has until he has tried it out on the alien. Once the action has taken place the weapon is automatically dropped and another weapon has to be picked up and used to further damage the alien. The player has four crew members and when they have all died the game is over.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Fortress of Zorlac</em> is a shoot 'em up with some similarities to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9396/yars-revenge/\">Yars' Revenge</a>. The player's objective is to rid the galaxy of a dreaded alien called Zorlac. Zorlac is positioned on the right side of the screen and is protected by a fortress consisting of three rotating walls as well as four indestructible stationary guns. The player starts out at the left edge of the screen but can move around in all directions. To be able to hit the alien the player first has to blast a hole through the three walls. It is made harder by the constant movements of both the rotating walls and the alien. At the same time the player has to avoid being hit by the defense guns which automatically lock in on the player ship. As the game goes on the fortress slowly moves toward the player who gets less space to dodge the enemy fire. </p>\n<p>Once the player has been able to hit Zorloc, he gets enraged and the game moves on to the next level that's played at a higher speed. The player scores points by destroying the walls of the fortress and for hitting the alien. Points are awarded based on the skill level chosen before a game and the player's distance from the edge of the screen. Hitting the alien is worth fifty times more than destroying a block in the fortress. The player has access to five ships and once they have all been destroyed the game ends.</p>",

Like in the original arcade game the player has to save a maiden from a vicious monkey. To reach the maiden at the top of the screen the player has to climb ladders and jump between platforms. A ladder is automatically climbed when the player walks into it and it is not possible to go back down (although some levels have lifts for going down). To avoid climbing a ladder the player has to jump past it and then the ladder is destroyed. The player has to watch out for barrels that are dropped by Kong as well as fireballs. Barrels can be jumped past while fire balls cannot be avoided. Ladders are destroyed when hit by a fireball which might make a level unfinishable. The player has five lives and is given a score when all are lost. After a game is over it's possible to restart from the current level without going back to the first.</p>",

The player is presented with a map of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and has to answer questions concerning various locations including cities, rivers, islands, mountains and straits. There are three types of questions: those where the player has to move a circle to the right location on the map, those where a location is marked on the map and the player has to choose the right name from a list and those where the player is given the name and has to choose one of the locations marked on the map. Depending on how close the player is or how many attempts are needed, up to three points are scored. A round consists of ten questions and the maximum score therefore is thirty. At the end of the round the player is given a mark.</p>",

The player has to rescue stranded life forms while watching out for aliens falling from the sky. The life forms are located at the right side of the screen and the player has to move from the left, across the screen, pick up the life form and then return to the starting position. Three <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a>-style shields offer some protection but are quickly destroyed. </p>\n<p><em>Outrider</em> is a shoot 'em up game controlled with only one button. The player controls a fighter ship circling a mothership that needs to be protected from various aliens. As the player ship moves around the mothership it constantly rotates and by pressing the fire button the aim is locked and shooting begins. There are four different kinds of aliens worth different amount of points. The game goes on until the mothership is completely destroyed.</p>",

By climbing ladders and jumping between platforms the player has to make his way to the top of the screen where Jane is located. At the same time it's necessary to avoid the barrels that Kong throws toward the player. </p>\n<p>The game has four levels. In the first one the player can use a hammer to smash barrels, in the second one there are trap doors to watch out for, in the third one there are walls and open spaces to jump over and across and in the final level there are collapsing girders to be wary of.

Blocks consisting of two tiles fall from the top of the screen and the player has to arrange these so that clusters of four or more tiles of the same sort are created. Once a cluster of tiles has been created it is removed and other tiles fall down in its place. By removing tiles from the board the player scores points and prevents the tiles from reaching the top which means game over. Sometimes garbage blocks fall onto the board and to remove them the player has to create clusters that are adjacent to them. </p>\n<p>Since the ZX81 doesn't support colour, the tiles are differed by symbols like asterisks, circles and dollar signs. When clusters begin to be created the tiles change from white to black. Three different difficulties can be chosen before starting a game. Unlike most games in the Puyo Puyo series, this version is for one player only, with no competitive mode.</p>",

If it is right then it appears as part of the word, but get it wrong and you move closer to the edge of the plank. You can only guess six letters wrong and if you do then you fall of the plank and into the sea. Get the word right and you move onto the next word.</p>",

Up to four players can compete in hot seat and the aim is to get as far as possible. Each player gets three chances before it's game over. There are two difficulties that the player has to overcome. First the player has to keep the car on the road and not crash. Second the player has to race at the correct average speed. There is a minimum speed that is checked every ten minutes (in-game time, not real time) and if the player is below it the car will be stopped by the computer. The minimum speed is initially 216 km/h and increases with 36 km/h for every test. Before starting the race there is a 30 second long demonstration mode that lets the player examine the race track beforehand.</p>",

        "description": "<p>During and after a christmas party at Macrobiology Industries Limited horrible thing happens in the laboratory's containment fridge as large quantities of swine-flu vaccine gets mixed with cucumber sandwiches and the boss' viagra supply. At the year's first day of work the company's security guard enters the site, finds the containment fridge smashed and realises that things aren't quite right. As the building now is full of virus spores, the security guards grabs his gun and gets ready for some shooting.</p>\n<p><em>Virus</em> is an action game where the player controls his character from a top down perspective. It is inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Into+The+Eagles+Nest\">Into The Eagles Nest</a>. The player can move in all four directions and use his gun to kill the viruses that he comes across. To progress he has to pick up keys that are needed to open some doors while other doors can be shot open. Other collectibles that will be needed are ammo and health packs. The objective of each of the eight levels is to kill all the viruses and get to the exit. Health is decreasing continuously with time so if all health packs have been collected it's necessary to hurry to the exit or the player will die. In case the player runs out of ammo it's possible to restart a level but that leads to the score being reduced.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>10 Games</em> is a collection of games and programs on one tape. The collection contains:</p>\n<p><strong>Klingons</strong>: You are a spaceship returning from a mining expedition and you have run into a Battlefleet of Klingons but you have no guns so with your shield you must ram them all. The game is viewed from above with you scrolling down the screen and the Klingons scrolling upwards. You receive extra points for any Battleships or Motherships that you hit.</p>\n<p><strong>Crash-Landing</strong>: Your spaceship has been hit by a meteor and you are prepared for a crash landing on a planet with the only control you have is using your rockets. The game is text only and you see your fuel levels, velocity, height and the time.</p>\n<p><strong>Simon</strong>: Based on the classic game where the computer shows you a sequence of colours and you have to input the same sequence. Every time you get the sequence correct, the computer adds another colour to the same sequence.</p>\n<p><strong>Artist</strong>: A drawing program that allows you to draw pictures and shapes on the screen with a cursor.</p>\n<p><strong>UFO</strong>: A row of UFO's sit on the top of the screen and your spaceship scrolls from the left of the screen below them, firing one shot at a time to remove parts of the UFO's. Every time you hit a UFO you score a point and you start scrolling from the left of the screen again. Missing a UFO or hitting the right side of the screen loses you points.</p>\n<p><strong>Code</strong>: Based on the game Mastermind, the computer thinks of a 4 digit number and you have to guess it within a set number of guesses. Once you enter a number the computer tells you which number is correct in the right place and which number is correct in the wrong place.</p>\n<p><strong>Asteroids</strong>: Your spaceship has hit an asteroid field and like the game Klingons you have no gun but instead of ramming the asteroids you must avoid them for as long as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Bomber</strong>: The game is viewed from the side as you watch a Bomber fly from left to right across the screen. The land is below with a dam on it and you must drop a bomb to hit the dam. Each dam that you see appears in a different location.</p>\n<p><strong>Kaleidescope</strong>: This is program based on the toy where you see dots moving about the screen making symmetrical shapes. There is no interaction from the player.</p>\n<p><strong>Guillotine</strong>: A two player game based on the pen and paper game Hangman but instead of saving your self from being hanged you must stop yourself from getting your head chopped off by a Guillotine. Player One enters a word and Player two has to type in letters to guess the word. Get a letter right and it appears in the word but get it wrong and a Guillotine starts to appear.</p>",

He must dig his way through the earth and excavate the gold but at the same time avoid the creatures that move around under ground.</p>\n<p><em>Forty Niner</em> is viewed from the side and the player has a full view of the level. Starting at the surface the player digs tunnels through the earth and the goal is to collect all the nuggets. At the same time it's necessary to watch out for giant rats that burrow through the earth to get into the player's tunnel. It's possible to delay them by knocking down supports that causes cave-ins. The only way to kill a rat is to release a snake from its nest. At the same time there are gremlins which attempt to reach the entrance of the mine and thereby blocking the player's exit. To stop it from doing this the player has to return to the surface and replenish the main mound with the pile of earth that appears when the player digs.</p>\n<p>The player earns more points the deeper he digs but he also has to walk further to replenish the mound. When all nuggets have been collected a cave opens which allows the player to move on to the next level. The new levels have more rats but there are less snakes to kill them with.</p>",

The player has to steer his bike (whose tail continuously grows) around an arena while avoiding crashing into the AI rider, the walls or the bike's tail. The player earns points every time the opponent crashes and a game goes on until the player has lost all of his three lives. The speed of the game increases with time. There are three different arenas to race in: open arena which doesn't have any obstacles, torus arena which has a large obstacle in the middle and deadly arena which has a large amount of small obstacles.</p>",

Alphaprobe attempting to land on a landing pad on the surface of various planets. Viewed from the side, you are dropped from your Mothershhip and you fall towards the surface of the planet using your thrusters to control your descent. You can move your craft left or right but you can't move your craft upwards, only slow the descent as you aim for the landing pad. Using the thrusters uses fuel but you can land on fuel dumps to increase your levels. Once you land then you move onto the next planet but it is game over if you land too fast (over 10 m/s) or run out of fuel. There are five skill levels (1-5) with 1 being the easiest and on levels 3 to 5 there are also spores in the air that need avoiding.</p>",

You can move your car left or right, and increase your speed but you can't slow down and the faster you drive the quicker your score increases. If you hit other cars then you stop which also stops your score increasing.</p>\n<p><strong>Missile Man:</strong> Based on Galaxians, you must move your craft left or right at the bottom of the screen to blast and destroy the aliens above moving left and right. The aliens will drop missiles on you and occasionally an alien will move down the screen. If you are hit by a missile or an alien then you lose one of three lives.</p>\n<p><strong>Spacefighter Pilot:</strong> Your crippled Mothership is orbiting a planet but the planet residents are firing missiles upwards to destroy it. You control a crosshair at the top of the screen and you must move left or right and hit the missiles. If your Mothership is hit too many times then it is game over.</p>\n<p><strong>Greedy Gobbler:</strong> In this Pac-Man clone you must move about a maze eating all the dots while avoiding ghosts who are out to kill you. If you touch a ghost then you lose one of three lives but there are four power-pills that can be eaten to allow you to eat the ghosts for a limited time.</p>\n<p><strong>Extra Terrestrial:</strong> Your mission is to destroy the whole world before a timer reaches zero. You move across the screen to the right above a map of the world. Pressing keys 1 - 8 fires a missile and the number you press determines the range of the missile.</p>",

To prove that you have taken the route you must buy souvenirs from twelve capital cities including Amsterdam, Vienna and Madrid. Starting with \u00a31500 in your pocket, you must first decide whether to take the standard or express (more expensive) journey to the next city. As you travel between various stops between the two cities, random events happen like losing money or being delayed. When you reach your destination you must decide how much money to exchange for the cities' currency taking note that any currency you have left will be lost when you leave the city. You have a choice of souvenirs to buy before buying your next ticket to the next city.</p>",

You place your various length ships vertically or horizontally on one grid while the computer does the same. Once all the ships are in place, you both take it in turns to choose a square on the other grid to fire a shot to hopefully hit an opponents ship. Both players take it turns until a player sinks all the other players ships.</p>",

The player controls Diamond Dan who must be navigated through ten different caverns while collecting all the diamonds he finds. At the same time the player has to watch out for rocks. Standing under a rock for more than a short moment will lead to Dan being crushed. Each level consists of a single screen. Since there is not much space to move in the player has to plan ahead. This makes the game more puzzle oriented than the original Boulder Dash since there is only one correct path to take through the level. Another difference is that there are no monsters. The only way to die is to be crushed by a rock. After four deaths the game is over. When stuck the player can restart the level but that also leads to a life being lost.</p>",

The games have similar graphics but unlike Rock Crush, Dans Revenge is not a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Boulder+Dash\">Boulder Dash</a> variant. The protagonist is the same, Dynamite Dan, and the objective is still to navigate him through ten caverns while collecting all the diamonds. Here though there are no rocks to be crushed by. Instead there are monsters that move back and forth in predefined paths who will kill Dan if contact is made. Once all diamonds have been collected a secret door appears that the player has to reach to move to the next level. After four deaths the game is over.</p>",

You can speed up or slow down your craft and you are able to move your sight left or right. Below your sight is a small radar and this shows any ships flying behind you. On the sides of the main playing area you can see a timer counting down, amount of bombs, fuel levels, power, speed and score. The faster you travel the more power and fuel you use.</p>",

The aim is to hit bricks on the right of the screen to make them disappear but if you let the ball past the bat then you lose one of three lives. Before the start of the game you can choose whether to play with one or two bats, and playing with two bats has them parallel to each other a small distance apart. There are also three types of games to play and they are:</p>\n<p><strong>Practise Game:</strong> A normal game with the choice to choose the speed of the bat (1-4) with 1 being the slowest.</p>\n<p><strong>Progressive Game</strong>: Every time you hit the ball it speeds up and also removing a set of bricks makes the ball faster.</p>\n<p><strong>Acceleration Game:</strong> The ball will speed up for every 10th brick disappearing and it speeds up when all the bricks have been removed.</p>",

You control an attack craft moving left or right below, firing missiles upwards to destroy as many Bugs as you can while avoiding their bombs. Firing missiles though uses fuel and to re-fuel you can either go back to the base on the left of the screen or wait till you run out and an rescue craft comes and re-fuels you. The rescue craft will also repair your craft if you are hit by a missile. There are 10 skill levels (1-10) with 1 being the slowest the Bugs move.</p>",

The game is viewed from the side and the game world is divided into single screen sections. Yoo can walk left and right and climb platforms up and down but he can not jump. Climbing down from platforms is a must since any falling will lead to an instant death and game over. To make progress through the world the player has to open gates by activating switches found around the world. There are also locked doors that require finding a key. Potions can be picked up and after that Yoo can survive falling from a platform which is necessary when there is no other path to take. But there are also bad potions that can kill Yoo and which the player has to watch out for. Clues are given in the form of messages written for each screen.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Alien Mind</em> is a block pushing puzzle game. Unlike <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Sokoban\">Sokoban</a> this game is played from a side view and uses gravity. The player controls a small alien that can walk on air and whose job it is to push the right boxes onto the right shelves. Each level has multiple boxes and multiple shelves but it's only the box that's marked with an x that needs to be moved. The level is completed when the x-marked box is placed on the shelf that is also x-marked. However the other boxes are still important since they can create bridges that allow the player to push the x box to it's shelf. Pushing a box that is located beneath another leads to the alien being crushed. Only one box can be pushed at a time. In total there are thirty levels and once one is completed the player moves on to the next one. A code for the level is also given.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Cassette Two</em> is a collection of ten games which contains:</p>\n<p><strong>Othello:</strong> Based on the board game, the idea is to fill a 8 x 8 grid with more counters than the computer. To remove an opponents counter you have to place a counter so that there is a number of opponent's counter between two of your counters. The opponents counters are then turned into your colour. Each player takes it in turn to place counters.</p>\n<p><strong>Awari:</strong> Based on an African game with sticks and beans, the idea is to move all your beans from your side of the pits and place them in your home pit. The amount moved into your home pit is depending on the amount of beans in the pits opposite.</p>\n<p><strong>Laser Bases:</strong> A strategy game where two players (one player and the computer) have ten bases each with an energy of three. The idea is to destroy all the others players bases with three choices for each base, Fire (3 energy), Shield (1 energy) or Nothing (0 energy). You write down your moves then tell them to the computer. The results for each base is then revealed.</p>\n<p><strong>Word Mastermind:</strong> The idea is to think of the five letter word the computer is thinking. After typing in five letters the computer tells you which letters are correct in the correct position and how many are correct in the wrong position.</p>\n<p><strong>Rectangles:</strong> Played on a 26 x 20 grid, the idea is to make bigger rectangles than the computer by placing two points on the grid to form a rectangle. Your rectangle won't show if the computer has points in your rectangle. You have to make rectangles big enough that won't get blocked.</p>\n<p><strong>Crash:</strong> You have to move a cursor that leaves behind a trail and catch the other cursor moving on the screen. To catch the other cursor you have to make it crash into your trail but you lose if you crash into it's trail.</p>\n<p><strong>Roulette:</strong> A gambling game where you have to bet on the the result of a wheel being spun with a ball and the number that the ball stops on. As well as picking a number you can also bet on the colour and other outcomes like the number is between 1-18, odd or even etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Pontoon:</strong> A gambling card game where you bet against the dealer to get 21 or the nearest to 21 without going over. You receive two cards and decide whether you want anther card or stick with what you have. Once happy with your cards the dealer then does the same. You win if you beat the dealer.</p>\n<p><strong>Penny Shoot:</strong> A penny falls from the top of the screen and you have to shoot it with a gun.</p>\n<p><strong>Gun Command:</strong> You have ten guns on the bottom of the screen and you choose which gun fires upwards to hit a plane flying above.</p>",

In this isometric shooter you control a craft moving it up or down, and the aim is to destroy as many of Xon's armaments as you can to reach Xon himself and bring him to justice. You have the choice of two weapons, a disruptor (more powerful) or a phaser, and you have the choice of turning your armour on and off. Moving the craft, using weapons, or having your armour on uses fuel shown by a gauge but fuel can be collected with a grappling hook or turning part of your score into fuel. If you crash or run out of fuel then it is game over. Once you have amassed 300000 points or played for two hours, you have the chance to grapple Xon with your hook.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Cassette Five</em> is a collection of eight games that contains:</p>\n<p><strong>Planetoids:</strong> Based on the game Asteroids, you control a spaceship in the middle of the screen and the aim is to destroy the Planetoids that move about the screen. Unlike Asteroids, the Planetoids don't split into two but parts disappear. You can turn 360 degrees, move forward and even hyper-space to another part of the screen. An alien ship occasionally appears and can be shot or avoided. Before the game you can select the speed of the game (1-100) and the difficulty (1-100) which dictates how much of a bonus you receive when you clear the screen.</p>\n<p><strong>Breakout:</strong> Based on the Arcade game, you control a bat moving it left or right on the bottom of the screen and the aim is to bounce a ball upwards to remove bricks above. If the ball passes the bat then you lose one of nine lives. Before you the game you can select the speed (1-999).</p>\n<p><strong>Space Rescue:</strong> A ship moves across the top of the screen and you must drop a rescue craft from it to fall down the screen. As the craft falls you can move it left or right to avoid Asteroids that move across the screen. Once landed on the planet below you pick up one of six stranded astronauts to take back up the screen. As you move upwards you must avoid ships but now you can accelerate and fire a beam at them. You must also make sure you dock with your ship and if successful you drop down again to rescue another astronaut. There are four skill levels, Beginner, Amateur, Skilled and Professional.</p>\n<p><strong>Draughts:</strong> Based on the board game, the aim is to capture your opponents pieces by jumping over them to take the piece if the square behind is clear upwards. There are three skill levels (1-3).</p>\n<p><strong>Byte-Man:</strong> Based on Pac-Man, you must move about a maze eating all the dots while avoiding three ghosts. If you touch a ghost then you lose one of three lives but there are power-pills and if eaten allow you to eat the ghosts for a short time. There is a choice of 3 mazes.</p>\n<p><strong>Dodgems:</strong> You move a vehicle around lanes eating dots while avoiding another vehicle because if you hit it then you lose one of three lives. Your vehicle is always moving forwards but you can change lanes through openings of the lanes. Before the game you can select the speed of the game (1-9).</p>\n<p><strong>Blitz:</strong> You control a plane flying above a city full of buildings and you have to bomb them all before your fuel runs out. The plane always moves forward but you can move up and down while you drop a bomb one at a time to remove parts of the buildings.</p>\n<p><strong>Merchant:</strong> A trading game that sees you in Venice in the Renaissance period with one ship, 2000 Florins and a debt of 5000. You must buy and sell items and sail to other cities to buy and sell more items. When you set sail then dangers can appear that can make you lose your cargo but you can buy more ships. The aim is to make 1000000 Florins.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Community Chest</em> is based on the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Monopoly\">Monopoly</a> and is a smaller version of the game. You play the computer and try to make money without going bankrupt. The game has 16 squares with 13 squares named after London streets, Community Chance, Jail and a Go square. The street squares are split into six sets. Each player takes it in turns to throw a dice to move their counter and if a street square is landed on then the player has a choice to buy it if the player has enough money. If the player has brought a street to make up a set then houses can be brought and placed on the square. </p>\n<p>As the players move buying streets and a player lands on a street square owned by the other player then that player has to pay rent and the cost depends on how expensive the street is and if there are any houses on it. Landing on a Community Chance square reveals an incident and this can either lose or gain the player money. The Jail square forces the player to pay a fee and if a player passes the Go square then they receive \u00a32000. A player will lose the game if they go bankrupt.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>City Patrol and Sabotage</em> is a double game pack containing the following two games:</p>\n<p><strong>City Patrol:</strong> In this 1st person shooter, you are in command of a Laser-Cannon Platform and you must defend your city from alien invaders attempting to destroy it. Controlling your sights, you must move about the city, scrolling left or right, in search of the invaders. Once you find one you must blast it before any damage is inflicted to the buildings or yourself. As you fire you must be careful as you can also destroy buildings as well. Your Laser-cannon can take five hits before it is destroyed and it is game over. Before the game you can choose a skill level from moderate, difficult or impossible.</p>\n<p><strong>Sabotage:</strong> The game is set in a ammunition compound viewed from above with the whole compound on the screen. You have the choice of playing either as a saboteur trying to place an explosive and cause as much damage as he can, and a guard trying to prevent the saboteur from succeeding. Playing as the guard sees you trying to predict the movements of the Saboteur in a set number of moves. You are armed with a truncheon and if close to the Saboteur then he will move out of your hitting range. You must try to corner the Saboteur or prevent him moving to his target as he will blow himself up. Points are awarded or deducted for any prevention or damage caused. Playing as the saboteur now has you trying to place the explosive while avoiding the guard who now is armed with a rifle in a set number of moves. Once again points are awarded or deducted according to how much damage is caused or if you are caught or shot.</p>",

You choose a square and a letter is revealed, then you choose another square and hopefully match the same letter. If they don't match then the letters disappear and you choose two more squares. If they do match then the pair of letters stay on the screen.</p>\n<p><strong>Number Challenge:</strong> A game based on the game Simon for one to six players and each player has three turns to get the highest score memorising sequences of numbers. Each player can choose from one of three games a turn, Straight Forward, Back Up, and Both Ways with each one having varying levels of difficulty and scoring more points. Straight Forward has the player watching a sequence of numbers and then typing in the same sequence. Get it right and the computer then adds a new number to the sequence. Back Up has the player having to type the sequence backwards and Both Ways needs the sequence typing in forwards and backwards.</p>\n<p><strong>Word Challenge:</strong> Based on the game of Boggle for one to six players with each playing attempting to make as many words as they can from a 5 x 5 grid full of mixed letters. As a timer counts down, each player must write down as many words as they can from the letters in any direction but the letters must touch. At the end of the timer, each player writes down their score and the winner is the player with the highest score.</p>",

The game is viewed from the side and scrolls from left to right constantly, and you can move your ship up or down. As you fly and bomb the surface below, you must watch out for missiles that fly upwards but these can be avoided, bombed or shot with your laser. You can also thrust forward to speed up and avoid them. You must keep an eye on your fuel levels as it decreases but you can increase it by bombing fuel dumps on the surface. if you are hit by an missile, crash into the surface or run out of fuel then you lose one of five lives.</p>",

The game is viewed from above and the first thing to cross is a busy road full of traffic scrolling across the screen. You can move left, right or forward as you dodge the traffic to reach a river bank. Once the road has been survived then a river must be crossed by jumping on logs or the backs of turtles that scroll across the screen as well. Once you reach the other side of the river you must jump into a gap and occasionally a baby frog or flies appears for extra points. If you get hit by a vehicle, fall into the river, or touch the sides of the screen then you lose one of three lives. Before the game you can change the speed of the game (1-100) with 1 being the fastest.</p>",

The whole Palace is in pitch blackness and you must move about feeling your way with walls appearing briefly if you hit them but you are shown if you have been in a place before. You have on your person a certain amount of clubs and torches, but step on a hole and you lose half of what you are carrying. Clubs allow you to knock down some walls or throw and you must have a least one or the game is ended as you cannot kill the Beast without one. </p>\n<p>Torches shine a light in a straight line, stopping when it hits a wall before going out. If the beast is awakened then he will come looking for you and any trails he finds he will follow but the Beast must be killed before you can get the Damsel to follow you if you find her. Once the Beast is dead and the Princess is following you, you must find the exit before she starves to death. Before the game you have three skill levels and they are Easy, Medium and Difficult.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>QS Asteroids</em> is a fairly basic conversion of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8872/asteroids/\">original arcade game</a>. The action starts immediately after loading (no title or options screens here) and players finds themselves in a space ship in the middle of the screen with numerous asteroids passing by. To control the ship, two keys are used for rotating it, one for shooting and another for thrusting it forward. Shooting can be done in eight directions. On an unmodified ZX81, the ship is represented by a number which changes with rotation (For example 0 means it's pointing up, while 4 is down) and the asteroids are o's, while users with a QS CHRS board get graphics more similar to the arcade original. The player starts with three ships and after 10,000 points a bonus ship is given. Asteroids appear in waves. The first one has two large ones and the number increases with each new wave.</p>",

You control a spaceship and you have to fly over the surface of a planet and blast all alien ships and missiles that fire upwards towards you. As well as a laser to fire at the aliens and missiles, you also have one smart-bomb which destroys everything on the screen. If you touch an alien ship, missile or crash into the surface then you lose one of three lives. Before the game starts you can choose the speed of the game (1-10) with 10 being the slowest.</p>",

Movement is limited to moving up and down and there are two weapons to attack with: forward going missiles and bombs that are dropped onto ground targets. Five missiles can be fired at a time and three bombs can be dropped at a time. Targets include aliens that swoop down from above and rockets that launch from the ground. On the ground there are also fuel dumps. The game goes on until the player has lost all three lives or the fuel runs out.</p>",

Using the radar allows you to see the location of any ships and if any are seen then you can adjust your power of your engines and direction. Once you are near to a ship you can switch to periscope mode and look around your position 360 degrees. Once a ship is seen and in range you can fire a torpedo and hopefully sink the ship. Once sunk then you look for more enemy ships with your radar. You also have the option to dive and this is useful for when the enemy drop depth charges but your air gauge needs checking. If air is low then you can surface and open a snorkel. Before the game you have three skill levels and these are Beginner, Professional and Expert.</p>",

You can move in a North, South, East or West direction and if you hit a wall then that part of the wall stays on the screen.

If you are caught then you lose one of three lives but there are power-pills that can be collected and this allows you to eat the ghosts for a short time.</p>\n<p><strong>Star Fighter:</strong>  Earth is being invaded by a huge Zylorian invasion force and you have been tasked to hold them back for as long as possible. The game is a single screen shooter viewed from the side where you control a craft on the left side of the screen moving up or down. The aliens move from the right of the screen and you must blast them trying to let none past you. If you are hit by an alien or it's missiles then you lose one of three lives and if the amount of aliens is too much then you can warp to another part of space, once every life. Although you cannot stop the invasion force, the more you destroy the easier it will be for Earth to defend itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Bomber:</strong> Your mission is to fly repeatedly over a dam and bomb it to inflict as much damage as you can with 30 bombs. Your plane just flies from left to right over the single screen and you press any key to drop the bombs. Parts of the dam are worth different amount of points.</p>",

To reach higher places in the hive ladders are used since jumping is not possible (falling is though). Other bees refill the cells but will sting the player if they get the opportunity. The hive is five screens in size with one third consisting of underground labyrinths. The player starts at the top of it and for every level cleared moves deeper down into it. For each new screen the hive gets wider and there are more bees buzzing around until the underground is reached where there are as many as twenty bees on the screen at a time. After completing the final screen the player moves on to an extra tough mega-hive. The positioning of honey cells in the hive is randomized for each playthrough. When stung by a bee the player respawns at the bottom of the screen but keeps the honey collected. It's possible to be stung 30 times before the game is over.</p>",

You control a spacecraft and you must fly over a mountainous planet's surface bombing various installations while avoiding missiles that fly upwards. As well as your bombs you are also armed with a laser that fires forward. As you fly, a fuel gauge decreases and you need to bomb fuel dumps to keep your fuel levels up. If you are hit by a missile, crash into the surface or run out of fuel then you lose one of three lives and it's the 2nd players turn if two player is selected.</p>",

A sword can only be used once to fight but there are many swords scattered around the maze. You will also encounter prisoners bricked up in the walls and they will give you a route to the treasure, but the route only appears for ten seconds so you will need to move as quick as you can. A map showing part of the maze can be brought up at any time showing you any Mazogs, prisoners, swords and the treasure if near.

You fly left to right across the screen slowly descending downwards, but you can move up or down. Once you have dropped a bomb, you are unable to drop another one until the bomb hits a building or the ground. It is game over if you hit a building or run out of fuel and you have a choice of speed (1-255) with 1 being slowest.</p>\n<p><strong>Rat's Nest:</strong> There is a rat running around the screen leaving a trail behind it and you have to move about the screen to box it in. If you hit the Rat's trail or move back on yourself then it is game over. There are a choice of speeds (1-250) with 1 being the slowest.</p>\n<p><strong>Snake:</strong> You move a snake's head with a tail around the screen to catch falling dollar signs. As you collect the dollar signs the game will get faster and your tail shorter.</p>\n<p><strong>Sketch Pad:</strong> A program that allows you to draw shapes and pictures by controlling a cursor on the screen.</p>\n<p><strong>Cross the Road:</strong> You are on the right of the screen and you have to get to the left of the screen by avoiding the cars moving up the screen.

The opponent's colour is then turned into the player's colour and it is then the other player's turn. This carries on until the board is full or no counters can be placed.

        "description": "<p><em>Phoenix Adventure</em> is an arcade adventure where you must find and kill a Black Phoenix over four parts with an energy of 100. The parts you will encounter are:</p>\n<p><strong>Hexagonal Room:</strong> You are in a room with eight doors leading to eight rooms described with text. Inside the rooms are creatures and traps and you must enter each room finding objects to take to other rooms to receive other objects. If you enter a room that has been solved then you lose 15 energy. </p>\n<p><strong>Land of the Goblins:</strong> You have been teleported to a large area viewed from above on the whole screen. You start on the left of the screen and you have to reach an exit on the right side of the screen. Also in this area are Goblins and Dragons and you must avoid them or lure the Goblins into swamps and find a sword to kill the Dragons. You move one place at a time in eight directions before each creature moves one place each and if you touch a creature you lose energy. Food can also be collected to give you energy boosts.</p>\n<p><strong>Coded Room:</strong> This part takes the form of a wordsearch grid full of letters and you must move around the grid horizontal and vertically to make a message. The message must be continuous and if you get a letter wrong then you lose energy and have to start the grid again with a new message.</p>\n<p><strong>Land of Phoenix:</strong> You are now in an area viewed from above with the whole area seen on screen. There are five locations and also where the Phoenix lives and you must explore the locations to equip yourself for the final showdown. The locations are Pit, Caves, Castle, Swamp and Forest and like the Hexagonal Room, there are objects and traps, and you must enter each one to get the objects to help you receive other objects. Once you are equipped you can go and face the Phoenix.</p>",

The game is a horizontal side view shooter with the screen scrolling from left to right constantly. As you fly over the surface of the planet you will encounter various alien crafts and all must be destroyed with your limited amount of lasers but you can get more by landing on landing pads. If you are hit by an alien craft or it's weapons then you lose one of five shields and when they reach zero you lose one of five lives. Being hit by bombers or hitting the surface loses all the shields in one go and loses you one life. There are six levels to choose from (1-6) with six being the hardest.</p>",

Larger asteroids are split into smaller ones that has to be shot until they are fully destroyed. Controls involve rotating the ship left and right, using thrust to move forward and brake to slow down. A hyperspace jump can also be used to avoid collisions. Keys used can be redefined by the player. The alien saucers from the original game are however not included. Upon colliding with an asteroid one life is lost.

        "description": "<p><em>Super Scramble</em> is a variant of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Scramble\">Scramble</a> that consists of six stages with different obstacles and enemies. Like the original arcade game it's a side scrolling shoot 'em up set inside a cave where the player can shoot at targets in front of him as well as dropping bombs at ground targets. Here the cave is inhabited by a wicked witch that the player has to destroy.</p>\n<p>At the first stage stalagmites grow across the cave that the player has to blast his way through while later stages add other obstacles such as stalactites and erupting volcanoes. Later in the game there are vampire bats. With one sitting on the ship it can no longer climb, with two it's necessary to steer upward to avoid falling and with three the player is doomed unless he can brush them off on a cave wall. At the final stage the player will meet the witch herself who has to be shoot on the nose while her magic spells are avoided. The game be played by one or two players (hot seat) and a skill level 1-5 can be selected before starting.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Chopper Drop 3000</em> is a single screen shoot 'em up. The player controls a helicopter and has to drop bombs on an enemy tank that moves on the ground beneath him. At the same time he has to avoid being hit by projectiles not only from the tank but also from a flying object that moves around above him. While hovering stationary the bombs are dropped straight down while when in motion the bomb retains the forward inertia and falls at an angle. The player has to be aware of the helicopter's fuel level but by destroying tanks the fuel is recharged. When hit by a projectile the game ends and the player gets a score based on how many tanks have been destroyed. As the tank count increases the game gets more difficult.</p>\n<p>The game is a remake of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/72251/chopper-drop/\">Chopper Drop</a>, a 1K type-in game that the author wrote in 1983 and which was published in the New Zealand magazine Bits &amp; Bytes in 1984.</p>",

With the use of two redefinable keys the player rotates the triangle in an attempt to avoid the various shapes that continuously moves towards it. ZXagon doesn't have the various levels of the original game. It only consists of one endless level that goes on until the player collides with a shape. Due to the constraints of the hardware the game doesn't have solid graphics like the original, instead using a wireframe look.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Pinbat</em> is a combination of Pinball and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Breakout\">Breakout</a>. The player launches a marble from a plunger at the right side and the table consists of various bumpers and other objects like in real pinball but instead of flippers at the bottom there is a bat that the player moves left and right in an attempt to hit the marble before it goes out of play. At sidewalls the marble obeys the laws of reflection but at some objects like stars and grey blocks the marble is thrown off at a random angle. By hitting stars and other targets the player earns points. The game consists of five rounds each with a different table design and each round goes on until the player has lost three marbles.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Spelling Bee</em> is an educational game where the player has to pick out the misspelled word from a list of five words. Each test consists of ten problems and at the end the player will get a score. There are both easy and difficult versions of the test. In the easy test the player only has to pick the misspelled word while in the difficult it's also necessary to type in the correct spelling. After playing at least one game it's possible to check scores, list misspelled words and to take a test with only words that the player got wrong before.</p>\n<p>There are four programs on the tape each with problems adapted to a certain difficulty level. From third graders and under on the easiest level to tenth grade through preparation for college SAT on the hardest. Each program has 25 sets of words.</p>",

The game plays like any other version of the shoot 'em up with the player moving the laser base along the bottom of the screen while shooting at the aliens that move back and forth above. Four barriers offer some protection from the enemy fire and sometimes a saucer worth extra points moves across the screen. The game ends when the player has been destroyed three times or the aliens land on the base line.</p>",

Your mission is to rid the Galaxy of Klingons before they can start a large scale attack on the Mothership in 181 hours time. The Galaxy is divided into 16 quadrants, with each quadrant divided into four sectors. You must move around the sectors and quadrants searching for the Klingons and attempting to destroy them.</p>\n<p>You ship is equipped with Short Range Scanners and Long Range Scanners, and these can tell you the locations of any nearby Klingons, Starbases and stars. For combat you have phasers and torpedoes which use up energy, and to protect you, you have a shield and you decide how much energy to go into your shields. As you search the galaxy you can also dock with Starbases which can repair your ship and this starts a small arcade sequence where you take control of your ship and attempt to move the ship into a gap in the base.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Cannon War</em> is a shooter game where the player controls a cannon along the left edge of the screen. Other cannons will appear from the right side and shoot towards the player. If a cannon ball reaches the player's border he will lose a life and therefore it's necessary to shoot them down before they do so. The player can also attack the enemy cannons but to do so he has to move forward from his starting position into the screen and from there shoot at the enemies. Being stationed in the middle of the battlefield makes defending the border harder since there is less time to move the cannon vertically. Destroying a cannon ball is worth five points while destroying a cannon is worth twenty. At 500 points the player gets a bonus cannon. The game ends when all the player's cannons (three at the start) has been destroyed.</p>",

You have to blast all the asteroids, and when one is shot then it splits into smaller asteroids and keeps repeating the process until the asteroid has gone. You can turn your craft left or right 360 degrees but you can also move forwards. Occasionally an alien craft will appear and when shot gives you bonus points. If you are hit by an asteroid or the alien craft then you lose one of three lives. Two players can play and each player takes it in turns when the other player loses a life and there are five levels of play (1-5) with one being the easiest.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>ZX Compendium</em> is a collection of six games and programs that contains:</p>\n<p><strong>Alien Intruder:</strong> During a long space voyage to Earth, you have been woken from cryogenic suspension to find, to your horror, the rest of the crew devoured by an alien lifeform. To prevent yourself being the next item on the menu you have decided to collect enough essential supplies before escaping in a shuttle. The game is a text adventure with some graphics where the screen is split into two. The top half shows a map of one of the three levels of the ship with your location and the aliens if on the same level as you, a map showing your immediate surrounding area and any exits, and finally the supplies you need to collect which are oxygen, cells, water and food. The bottom half of the screen has text describing your current location and you type in commands with the keyboard to interact with each location. If you enter a location with the alien then you die but if the alien enters your location then you need to deal with the situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Wumpus Adventure:</strong> A text adventure that allows one to four players to move around an area hunting for creatures called a Wumpus to kill. Before you start the hunt you have a number of options and they are, choice of caverns (Novice, Random Cave Pattern and Professional Hunter), number of players, and if you hunt to the death or kill a certain amount of Wumpus. The actual game sees text on the screen describing each location of a player and the current player types in commands to interact with their surroundings. Each player gets one move before the next player has a turn. The players are armed with five arrows but more can be collected, and as well as Wumpus there are other creatures like Goblins and giant serpents that need to be dealt with.</p>\n<p><strong>Numerology:</strong> A program that allows you to enter your name and birth date to receive a reading about your personality and find out your lucky number, colour and day of the week.</p>\n<p><strong>Hangman:</strong> Based on the pen and paper game, you can compete against the computer or another person as you try to guess a word without being hanged. A word is generated and you have to select a letter at a time to try to make the word. If you guess a correct letter then it appears in the word but get one wrong and a man being hanged on a scaffold starts to appear. The computer has two levels (1-2) to choose from.</p>\n<p><strong>Hieroglyphics:</strong> You have to decipher 39 Hieroglyphics by placing a letter or a vowel combination under the correct symbol and the computer will give you a word to help you decipher them. You must be careful in your guesses though because each wrong guess sees trapped explorer Wullie Makeit's tomb slowly fill with sand.</p>\n<p><strong>Movie Mogul:</strong> A management game where with a limited budget you have to buy a script and attempt to make a movie and make a profit with it. After buying a script you decide which type of movie to make as well as hiring a director, actor and actress. You decide on each day of filming how much money to spend on various options watching your budget levels decrease. Once you have completed filming you are given a final score as a profit or loss for the finished movie.</p>",

In <em>Dungeons of Doom</em> you have to move downwards through the dungeons to find the treasure, while <em>Escape from the Underworld</em> has you falling through the floor and having to move upwards to the entrance to the castle.</p>\n<p>The games are played on a 10 x 10 cube and on the screen you have a map of your location plus the surrounding areas. You must move around through the corridors and up and down stairs searching rooms that you encounter. There are hazards and creatures who occupy certain rooms and when you encounter a creature you have a short time to decide whether to fight, use a spell or retreat. You have a certain amount of hit points and this reduces with every trap, incident or a fight with the creatures. Each player has one move before the next player has a turn.</p>",

The game plays largely the same as its predecessor but the game engine has been tweaked to allow for a larger amount of enemies. The game is till played from a top down perspective and the player can move and shoot in all directions (now also diagonally). The objective for each level is to clear all viruses. What's different from the first game is that all viruses are spawned from virus generators that have to be destroyed. If not then more viruses will continuously appear. To get through the levels health packs has to be collected since health continuously decreases over time and keys has to be located to open doors. There's no need to collect ammunition though since an endless amount is available from the start. The game is three times as large as its predecessor with a total of 24 levels.</p>",

Like the game it's based on, it is a variant of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Frogger\">Frogger</a> that is viewed from an isometric perspective. The game is endless and the player's goal is simply to make it as far as possible without dying. To do so it's necessary to cross roads, rivers and rail tracks without being hit by a vehicle or drowning. For every step taken forward the player's score increases by one. The screen automatically scrolls forward and the player has to keep moving or disappear from the screen. Leaving the playing area in any direction will result in death.</p>",

The gameplay works just like in the original with the player moving left and right while shooting at the aliens that move back and forth across the screen. The aliens drop bombs that have to be avoided and four shields offer some protection. The aliens differ from the arcade game in that they only move horizontally but never descend. The player has three lives and the game ends when they have been used up. Before starting out it's possible to choose the firing rate for the player's missiles as well as for the aliens bombs, from one to six. The game can be played by one player, two players taking turns or two players playing simultaneously.</p>",

The objective is to get the highest score by rolling two dice and adding the result of each roll. The game is played in ten rounds and when the player chooses to stop the score is added to the one of previous rounds. Rolling the starting value a second time leads to a crap out and all points of the round will be lost.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Brain Teaser</em> is a puzzle game similar to the board game Lights Out. The player is presented with the numbers 1 to 9 shown on a 3 by 3 grid. Numbers are either normal or inverse and the goal is to get an inverse 5 and all others as normal. The player can choose to flip any number but then also all adjacent numbers will be flipped.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Super Dice</em> is a program that simulates dice rolls. The player can roll up to five six-sided dice or one four-, eight-, ten-, twelve- or twenty-sided die.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

The game is set in FuenteTortillo del Alcornocal, province of Badajoz, which has become increasingly unsafe as the streets are now full of Roboces (clones of Fanty, Wolfy, Vampy and Franky created by the evil Dr. Brain) who steal money from the citizens. Uwol steps in to take care of the problem.</p>\n<p>Uwol is not controlled directly, instead the player controls a set of cross-hairs that can be moved freely on the screen similar to a gallery shooter. An automatic shotgun is used to shoot. Enemies shoot back and the player has to watch out not to kill anyone innocent such as Uwol on the screen. To finish a level a number of coins need to be collected, left behind by defeated enemies. The require amount needs to be collected before time runs out as well.</p>",
