        "description": "<p>Colecovision's only baseball game and first of the Super Action series, <em>Super Action Baseball</em> was specially designed to work with the Super Action controllers.</p>\n<p>Batting is done with an angled view wherein you see your batter in the bottom-left of the screen and the pitcher at center-right. The top part of the screen is reserved for keeping an eye on the bases. As the ball approaches, your player attempts to hit the ball with his bat to send it flying. A successful hit will result in your player having to run around the bases. Running is done with the \"wheel\" on the top of the Super Action Controllers. Stealing is also possible.</p>\n<p>Fielding is simple, using the Super Action controllers, players have 4 buttons to correspond to each base. Thus the ball can be thrown at any of the bases instantly.</p>",

Apart from the normal Tetris game mode, there is the <em>zero-out</em> mode, where you have to clear a set number of lines to win a game, and the <em>builder</em> mode, where the blocks don't fall automatically, giving you all the time in the world to plan your moves.</p>",

Along the way, you can drive over beach balls to pop them for points. Don't let a pothole go too long because if it does, it will become a manhole. If a beach ball falls into a manhole, it will emerge as a beach bomb, that can damage you. In a two player game, knock your opponent into the bombs. In a one player game, avoid the other steamroller as it will kill you except for the last few seconds of the round. In that short time, hitting it will kill it.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Mankind is under siege by demonic ghosts. Now its up to a heroic man named Bill armed only with his wits and a hammer to repel this invasion.</p>\n<p>In <em>Cosmic Crisis</em>, brick platforms are connected by ladders. Bill must maneuver around these platforms, punching holes in the brick platforms with his hammer in an attempt to trap a ghost. Once a ghost is trapped, Bill must get to the ghost and continue hammering at the hole until the ghost finally drops through the platform and gets hurt upon impact with the platform below it. While falling through one floor will destroy a white ghost, a red ghost will need to fall through two floors, and a blue ghost through three. Landing a ghost on top of another ghost below them is another way to destroy them too. Bill only has a limited amount of time to get rid of all of the ghosts in order to clear a stage. The game has six different stages in all and the player starts with only four lives to get through them.</p>\n<p>The game has four difficulty levels, with each higher difficulty increasing the speed of the ghosts except the last difficulty which simply adds an additional red ghost.</p>",

You guide a snake through 20 screens, trying to eat all of the apples while avoiding crashing into the border, the maze barriers, and yourself. Complicating matters is the fact that every time you eat an apple, your snake grows a new segment, making it more and more difficult to avoid crashing into yourself.</p>",

In the slalom, five-second time penalties are assessed for each missed gate, while in downhill, skiers must negotiate between moguls.</p>",
