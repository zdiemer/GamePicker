        "description": "<p><em>Moto-Crash +</em> is a motorcycle racing game. The goal is to drive as far as possible within the time limit of three minutes. The game features 4 predefined circuits (selected with the keys 1 to 4 at the start of the game) plus one random circuit generated by the computer (selected with the 0 key).</p>\n<p>The conditions of each circuit change as the player progresses. The race starts during daytime; once the player drives 6 km the night falls; at 10 km, the road becomes wet; at 20 km, the road becomes snowy and at 30 km the road becomes icy. Changes in weather conditions are not only accompanied by graphical changes but also gameplay ones, as the motorcycle's adherence to the road changes. If the player drives 6 km in daytime or 4 km in nighttime in any weather condition without crashing the computer awards him or her a bonus time.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Flash Point</em> is inspired by the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Robotron:+2084\">Robotron</a>. The story is that an alien fleet landed in the capital city of the United World Nations and the player has to defend it for as long as possible using a tank.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is divided in two main screens. The first screen is the city map, which shows the areas being attacked by the aliens as flashing points (hence the game's name). The areas will flash faster as time passes by, until they are completely destroyed or until the player moves to that area to defend it. Once the player reaches one of those areas, the game changes to the second screen, which shows the tank in the center of a green park area, with buildings around it. There are several aliens in this area, which will start homing the player, destroying the terrain in their way. The player has to destroy them as quick as possible, trying to save as much terrain (specially the central green area) as possible for a higher score. Once all aliens are destroyed, the player is sent back to the map screen to select another area. Moving in the map screen is faster on streets, slower on other ground types.</p>\n<p>The tank is controlled using both joysticks, one for movement and one for shooting in all eight possible directions. The game was released with a frame to hold both joysticks together. The player has 3 lives and one extra life is earned for each 30,000 points scored. The game has also a high score table.</p>",
