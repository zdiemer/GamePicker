In <em>Ancient Gladiator</em>, a limited number of arrows are used, while in <em>Future Gladiator</em>, the player has unlimited ammunition. Occasionally, a lion or a space mine will appear, and they have to be avoided. They can't be killed, but it is possible to send them off in the direction of the opponent. The player that first registers nine hits wins the round.</p>\n<p>In <em>Modern Gladiator</em>, the players alternate playing offense and defense. The offensive player has to get the ball to the goal on the far side by running the quarterback through or passing to the blocking back or wide receiver (which are computer controlled), while the defensive player attempts to tackle the opponent. Points are scored for successful touchdowns and tackles, and the aim is to reach nine points.</p>",
