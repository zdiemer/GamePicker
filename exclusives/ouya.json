        "description": "<p><em>Soul Fjord</em> is a hack-and-slash roguelike dungeon crawler that combines 13th Century Norse mythology as a setting with 1970s funk. The protagonist is Magnus Jones sporting an afro who has been denied access to Valhalla, a funk club in the afterlife. To gain entry he has to fight his way through nine levels and three bosses of the world tree Yggdrasil to prove himself and defeat the bouncer who tossed him out. The game has a humorous tone and a comic-like visual style with bright colours and wacky characters.</p>\n<p>As Magnus explores the levels he has two main actions: attacking and blocking. A distinct element adding to the combat is that the effectiveness can be massively improved by timing the actions to the beat of the music shown through notes scrolling by below the character. By timing correctly more damage is dealt, combo opportunities are opened up, and he is able to deflect attacks and dash. He has access to different types of weapons with two unique combos per weapon and the character can be customized through his backpack with different weapons, shields, helmet, clothing and potions. Magnus can also level up. Environments contain enemies, hazards and a lot of loot and destructible items. The game is free-to-play with microtransactions. Gold is the basic in-game currency used to buy new items. Platinum records act as the premium currency. They can be found in the game through drops and daily gifts, but additional ones can be bought for real money as well as a gold doubler to receive more gold from pick-ups. They can also be used to open up chests and get a chance to receive a powerful item. In addition the records are used to <em>soul bind</em> items so they are not lost after death and persist.</p>\n<p>After completing the game a new <em>hardcore</em> difficulty level is opened up next to the <em>regular</em> one. Except for the use of <em>soul bind</em> the game has permadeath and random level generation.</p>",

It is largely a remake of one of the previous games by the developer, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Grand+Prix\">Grand Prix</a>, but with motorcycles instead of cars and different scenery.</p>\n<p>The game is set in a desert environment. The goal is to complete ten laps and win the gold cup before time runs out. After each lap the timer is reset. There is an endless amount of opponents on the track that need to be avoided. Others dangers are signs that can cause crashes and getting off the road slows down the biker as well. There are sometimes small dunes that provide a jump and some sections take the bike through a tunnel. The game is controlled with the two analog sticks: the left for steering and the right for accelerating and braking.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>TowerFall</em> is a single-screen arena fighting game for two to four players with a pixelated visual style. A level consists of different platforms and passages. In deathmatch or team deathmatch style different players attempt to kill each other by jumping on opponents' heads or shooting them with an arrow, inspired by games such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5575/super-smash-bros-melee/\">Super Smash Bros.: Melee</a>. Arrows are one-shot kills but they come in limited quantities (generally only three) and can be picked up (also by other players) after being shot. In addition there are treasure chests and power-ups to pick up. The latter offer shields, wings, bramble arrows that have foliage creep up on characters, or bomb arrows that are able to destroy terrain. Further variation is provided through artifacts. These trigger environmental hazards such as lava filling up two sides of the screen or darkness where the entire level is shrouded except for the areas lit up by torches, offering shadows as a means to sneak up on opponents. There are often passages on the four sides of the screen to reappear on the other side.</p>\n<p>Levels have different themes and each level is re-arranged slightly so they are never completely identical. Players can choose to trigger certain level rules or handicaps for specific players to even the odds. Variants offer laser arrows and homing super bombs for instance. The game is meant to be played with multiple players. There is a single-player portion available, but it acts as a tutorial shooting motionless dummies in time-based objectives to earn medals. Controls consist of movement and aiming, and three buttons to dodge, shoot and jump. The four available characters are Assassin Prince, Last of the Order, Turncloak soldier and Vigilate Thief. Characters only have a single life per round.</p>",
