This simulation is controlled by an entity known as Perfect1 and it has to be destroyed in order to shut down the system. You are Immercenary Number Five, and it's your job to do it. </p>\n<p>From a secret lab, you log into the simulation which sends you to a place in Perfect known as the Garden. Every entity in the game has a certain rank that determines its offensive and defensive capabilities. You start at 255, the lowest rank, and must rise in ranks to defeat Perfect1, who holds rank number 1. To do so, you destroy higher-ranked Rithms, as the other entities in the game are called. To pass beyond certain ranks, unique Rithms high in the Perfect hierarchy have to be destroyed.</p>\n<p>Different weapons and power-ups can be collected and spent offensive and defensive energy can be recharged at energy spires. In the center of the Garden is a place called DOAsys, which functions as a neutral zone and healing center. There you can talk to other Rithms and ask for hints about combating special Rithms and where to find special items. These dialogue sequences take the form of live-action clips of actors in elaborate costumes playing the Rithms.</p>\n<p>When the player logs out of the simulation or is violently forced out, he returns to the lab where one may load and save a game and access detailed statistics on the trips to Perfect.</p>",

The tables are named Surf Room, Luv Room, and Disaster Room and they are connected to each other via Nexus. Player can choose to play one room or in the MetaGame mode, all of them in sequence. Each room has an objective and in the MetaGame mode, player must reach that objective to advance into the next room via the Nexus.</p>\n<p>Like any pinball, there are targets, tunnels, blocks, and all sorts of flashing things that increase the score, light up letters, or grant bonus items.

        "description": "<p>In a classic Japanese RPG style, <em>Guardian War</em> pits you as guardian golem against the dark forces of Azrael, the Evil Lord. Your world is infested with monsters and your job is to destroy them. Along the way you meet other golems that you need to revive so that they can join your quest. Your ultimate goal is to defeat Azrael.</p>\n<p>RPG elements are fairly standard with hit points, magic points, speed, mobility, skills, etc. Each golem type has specific abilities, for example, Priest is strong in Light Magic whereas Archer is strong in arrow attacks. General movement is done on the World map, which is divided into Fields, and the player is able to see which Fields are occupied by the enemy. Shops are only accessible on the World map. Selecting a Field takes the group of golems into a Field map which is presented in pseudo-3D.</p>\n<p>Players can freely travel the Field map, finding treasures and other items, periodically bumping into enemy groups. Battles are fought in turns on the same map, there is no separate battle screen. Movement is into main compass directions only and the player controls the whole group when traveling. Only during battle are each group member individually controllable.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Demolition Man</em> is a game based on the 1993 movie by the same name. You play as John Spartan (Sly Stallone); thawed out from cryo-prison into a peaceful, Utopian future. Your task is to capture your nemesis, the psychopathic Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes), who has freed himself from prison and is wreaking havoc around town.</p>\n<p>The 3DO version adopts a unique multimedia approach to the concept of a movie tie-in. Cutscenes and clips from the film are used when appropriate, but Stallone and actual props from the film (such as his uniform) were also brought in to shoot bluescreen clips specifically for the game. Stallone is placed inside the CD environments, setting up the coming gameplay sequences, which loosely act as an expanded \"director's cut\" of events in the film.</p>\n<p>The game follows the key points of the movie's plot across five missions (with a handful of levels each). Levels mimic most major sequences from the film, with additional ones inspired by. Four distinct game types show up as you progress through the plot:</p>\n<p><em>Shooting Gallery</em> sequences present a static screen with enemies popping up from behind cover. Hidden icons grant additional health or special bullet types. Either the standard controller or lightgun peripheral can be used here.</p>\n<p><em>Hand-to-Hand</em> sequences present a side view of you and Phoenix brawling as in a standard fighter. Blocks, sweeps, and high and low attacks are mixed up to break through your opponent's defense and wear out his energy.</p>\n<p><em>First Person Shooter</em> sequences place you in a maze of tunnels with numerous patrolling enemies. You have infinite ammo to quickly dispatch them. A tracking device can be displayed to show the general direction of Phoenix. Defeating him ends the level.</p>\n<p><em>The Driving</em> sequence occurs once and has you chasing Phoenix as he tries to flee in a stolen police cruiser. Avoid the other cars and hit power-up lanes to gain an advantage.</p>\n<p>Progress is saved with a password system, and victory or defeat both earn you one of a few special messages from Sly.</p>",

In the Rally Mode, you race your way through up to 30 tracks with the goal of staying alive and destroying the other contenders while you try and finish in the top three. If you succeed then you advance to the next track.</p>\n<p>In Tournament Mode you drive the same tracks in a sudden-death race for dominance. Along the way, you can win prize money by placing in the top three. You can then use that money to add guns, energy weapons, missiles, hazards, armor, and other special enhancements.</p>\n<p>You can choose from among six vehicle/driver combinations that are weighted towards firepower, speed, or balance. Unlimited pit stops are available to repair damage and reload your weapons.</p>",

You use a stun gun which must be charged up to have maximum effect. Docile dinos also mix with the hostile ones but turn hostile if shot unnecessarily.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"T-Rex Chase\" is a basic driving game where you must outrun a Tyrannosaurus (visible in your rear-view mirror) while simultaneously staying on the road and dodging hazards.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"Raptor Maze\" is a 3D, first-person game where you must escape a darkened building while being stalked by Velociraptors of increasing numbers. You have no weapons and must instead use gates to block the dinos and alternate pathways to slip by.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You must also hack computer locks to allow you access to the communications systems. Each lock is yet another minigame; these based off of arcade classics (<em>Space Invaders</em>, <em>Asteroids</em>) with dinosaurs and <em>Jurassic Park</em> characters.</p>\n<p>Your final rating is given based on your success in both areas.</p>",

The player has been recruited and is codenamed \"Stalker\" to defend the U.S. and bring back peace and order.</p>\n<p>There are 15 missions in all, where the player has to complete certain objectives, such as destroy a certain amount of enemies or defend certain targets.  The planes are mostly modern age such as the A-10 Warthog. The player can choose to use either the plane's machine guns or missiles to bring down enemy targets.</p>",

The player takes control of the son of a prominent archaeologist, who has recently discovered the long-lost tomb of Rassius III and has gone missing. It is now up to the player to find him by exploring the tomb, but at the same time avoid the various traps and enemies laid out before them.</p>\n<p>The perspective is from a first-person view as they progress through the maze-like pyramid equipped with a club, a shield, and a diary. As they progress they must avoid traps, but also use their club and shield to take out enemies such as giant wasps, scorpions, and even haunted urns. More powerful weapons and items can be obtained through further exploration as well as clues to decipher the diary and various puzzles that need to be solved in order to advance. The RPG element is present in weapons training; the more the protagonist uses a weapon, the higher is the damage inflicted with it.</p>",

In the Campaign mode, the player fights through various maps completing missions. The player is given a certain amount of funds to be spent on purchasing troops and vehicles. Once the units are placed on the map, the player is given a turn where they can move their units and fire on any opposing forces. Movement is done on a hex-based grid. </p>\n<p>The Tournament mode is the equivalent of an exhibition mode. The player can choose to play against the computer, another player, or even just watch the computer play itself. In this mode, the player is also given the option to set certain parameters and choose what map to fight on. </p>\n<p>There is also a bonus game which is like an 8-player version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10806/bomberman/\">Bomberman</a> with tanks.</p>",

To reclaim their human form, the player must explore the research facility and fight other mutants - \"Neo Organic Bioforms\". </p>\n<p>The player selects one of seven possible forms and spends points to customize its abilities and attack powers along the way. Exploration is performed in first-person, moving through the hallways in a fixed, grid-based system. Players can watch their minimap to track or avoid other bioforms. If the player encounters another mutant, the game switches to a tactical, turn-based fighting system. The player and the computer both try to target weak points on their enemy, with the winner of each turn shown attacking the other in an animated cutscene. The graphics are most noteworthy in using stop-motion puppets for all the bioforms, giving them a somewhat realistic look.</p>\n<p><em>N.O.B.</em> was only released in Japan and was one of the few games published by Sanyo.</p>",

Players pick between one of four characters, each with their own dedicated pinball table. The game then moves to a split-screen view, where both players play their respective table and try to get a higher score than their opponent.</p>\n<p>Other options include a 1-player \"story\" mode where the player selects a character and battles the other three. Winning here gives a character-specific CG victory movie. Players can also play against multiple opponents in a tournament mode (complete with brackets), though a maximum of two players will be playing at once. As with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/40875/real-pinball/\">Real Pinball</a>, the view angle is fixed and cannot be changed.</p>",

Like the best horror movies, it uses sound effects such as echoing footsteps and creepy changing music to increase the scary atmosphere.  </p>\n<p>It takes place in 1952, where you play as an investigator searching for the archeologist Dr. Hauzer who has disappeared.  He built his house over an archeologist site and became obsessed with the deity Kellbim to whom he sacrifices his interns.  You will die numerous times in the house's deadly traps but having unlimited save games makes viewing the death animations part of the fun.  You can switch the view between first-person, third-person, or overhead.  Choosing a different view will help you overcome some traps.</p>",

You play a chief inspector Totsukawa, a fictional detective created by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/512827/kyoutarou-nishimura/\">Kyoutarou Nishimura</a> (\u897f\u6751 \u4eac\u592a\u90ce), a Japanese writer of mystery novels. The victim appears to be living in a nearby apartment, and after checking the crime scenes and gathering clues, talking to witnesses and the person who found the body would be the next logical step.</p>\n<p>Unlike the PSP version released 15 years later, this game uses live-action during both cut-scenes and in-game investigation while gameplay relies upon icons that let you listen to what others have to say, talk to witnesses and suspects, and investigate the crime scenes. At the beginning of each day, you start with a meeting to discuss what you've uncovered thus far with your subordinates and decide what to do and where to go next. Each day progresses as you move from location to location, leaving you with a limited number of locations you can visit before the day ends, so following clues and figuring out where is the best thing to go next is of utmost importance in order to solve the crime.</p>",

The protagonist of the story is Akiko Sonoyama (\u5712\u5c71\u5343\u6676), a freelancer who finds herself in the middle of a murder mystery after the son of the host dies during the dinner right after drinking the wine. The game uses live-action videos and actors and shows the player protagonist in 3rd-person during an investigation, similar to other games of such era, such as <em>The Beast Within</em> or <em>Phantasmagoria 2</em>. During gameplay, the full-screen videos appear in the center of the screen with the border around the window showing various action icons and game progress. While the player character appears during cut-scenes and dialogues, navigating the environment is done in the first-person perspective. During dialogues, the player has a list of questions one can ask with replies being a set of live-action videos of certain characters addressing the player.</p>\n<p>15 years after the 3DO game release, the PSP remake with the same title was released. The main difference here is that live actors have all been removed, characters were replaced with silhouettes, and the game interface changed to look like a mystery visual novel but with selectable actions (such as talk or inquire). The latter of which makes the game less of a typical visual novel and only resembles it in its graphical presentation by using static backgrounds with dialogue text over it.</p>",
