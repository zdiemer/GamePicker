        "description": "<p><em>Catena</em> is an adaptation of the board game Othello. It is played on a board consisting of 64 squares. Players take turns placing squares on the board and the aim is to surround the opponent's squares which causes them to change colour to the one of the player. The game ends when the board is full and the player with the most squares in its colour will win. Squares are added to the board by using the controller's keyboard to enter the position on the board.</p>\n<p>The game can be played by one human player against an AI opponent or between two human players. It is also possible to run a game where two AI opponents compete against each other.</p>",

They are all for two players who play against the house.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Roulette:</em> Each player starts out with $200. To place a bet, the joystick is used to move a cursor and an amount can be entered for each number. Bets of 1 to 10 are accepted on the main board while on the outside bets of 1 to 99 are allowed. Once both players are done the wheel will spin and the computer will mark the winning numbers and make the transactions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Keno:</em> The computer picks 20 numbers out of 80 and the player selects between 2 and 15 numbers with the number of selections determining the odds and payoff. Each player has $100 and a $.70 wager is placed for each play. When both players are done, the computer picks the winning numbers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Slots</em>: The slot machine is simply operated by pulling the joystick down which causes the.three wheels to spin. No other options are possible. Winnings and losses are automatically accounted for by the computer. Each player starts out with $200 and each spin costs one dollar.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p><em>Pinball/Dungeon Hunt/Blockout</em> is a compilation of three games:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Pinball</em> is a basic pinball game. The player controls a paddle at the bottom (rather than a flipper) and must try to keep the ball in play. Various targets in the level score points when hit. Also included are moving and disappearing obstacles. Three variants are playable, one offering a faster ball speed and another using two paddles instead of one.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Dungeon Hunt</em> is a game for up to four players. Players must find hidden objects in a grid. Players take turns guessing a tile and whoever finds most wins the game.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Blockout</em> is a light cycle game for two players. Players move around the screen leaving a trail. Whoever hits a wall or a trail first loses the round. The game comes in four variations with different speeds and obstacles.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

Four bunkers can be used to take cover from enemies firing down at you. The bunkers slowly disintegrate with each shot. Sometimes a UFO flies over to shoot down for additional points. Once all aliens have been killed the level is reset and starts anew, the player is granted an additional life and bonus points. Two players can take turns in the hot-seat.</p>",
