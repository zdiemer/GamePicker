        "description": "<p>Originally released for PC (Windows) in 2004, the Blu-ray version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/72350/sora-no-iro-mizu-no-iro/\">Sora no Iro, Mizu no Iro</a> got its port six years later. Being played as a Blu-ray movie, its rating and content was left for mature audience and this romance visual novel features all the adult content that was on the original PC version. The player is Hajime Saisho (\u6700\u6240 \u5f0c), a sophomore student which also happens to be a member of the swimming club. The story takes place over summer vacations and centers on two heroines that both seem to have affection for you, but instead of having to choose which one you want to have relationship with, they don't seem to mind sharing you. But you only have time together during summer holidays, and before that is over you are determined to make every moment count.</p>\n<p>The Blu-ray version's gameplay is similar to other visual novels in that it allows you to quick save/load your game progress, check the message history, remove the text window to see the clear background, and make choices which branch the story. Game also features full voice-acting for NPCs and occasional animations. On part with most of visual novels, the daytime changes will reflect on the location you are currently visiting.</p>",
