        "description": "<p><em>Kung-Fu</em> is a martial arts game featuring one-on-one fighting for one player against an AI opponent or between two human players. The game is seen from a side view perspective and consists of single matches that are each made up of three rounds. Each round lasts ninety seconds and the goal is simply to have the highest score at the end of the third round. Points are earned each time the opponent is knocked down. It is possible to do four different attacks each corresponding to one of the directional keys on the keyboard (or joystick). There is one punch attack and three different kicks. Movement is limited to moving in two directions, advancing and retreating.</p>",

The player controls a car that races on a circuit consisting of five lanes. The circuit is full of dots that have to be collected to complete a level. The car moves automatically clockwise and it is only possible to change lane in the middle of each straight. From the opposing direction comes a jam car that attempts to crash into the player's car. If it succeeds the player will lose one of three lives. </p>\n<p>The game can be played by one or two players. There are two variants of the two-player mode. In both the players take turns attempting to collect the dots either against an AI driven jam car or having the second player taking the role of the jam car. The speed of the player's car can be chosen before a game: twice the pace of the jam car, same pace or half the pace. It is also possible to select a difficulty level from one to nine.</p>",

The player's task is to collect all seeds in the maze and avoid getting killed by the octopuses. In the corners of the maze are magical algae which when eaten allow the guppy to go after and kill its pursuers for a short while.</p>\n<p>There are three difficulty levels and each contains four stages. Each stage consists of two mazes with different layouts: first a simple one and then a more complex one. In the last stage the maze walls are invisible. There are three different octopuses with different movement speeds: blue, green and red. On the easiest level there is for most stages only one octopus (initially the slow blue one) while on the hardest there are up to three ones in motion at any time.</p>",

The robot's task is to retrieve broken computers that are scattered around each of the game's levels. The robot can walk left and right, climb stairs and make a short jump forward which is needed to overcome the many obstacles and pitfalls that are in its way. Among these are gates that open and close and floors that appear and disappear. Any contact with one of the obstacles or falling from a height causes the robot to lose one life. The player starts with three lives and when all used up gets a score based on the number of computers that have been collected. An extra life is earned upon the completion of a level.</p>",
