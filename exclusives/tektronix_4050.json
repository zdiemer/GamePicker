Depending on the location of a cloud above the playing field and the force and direction of the wind, the player gets to choose between various weather related weapons (hail, cyclone, lightning) which can fire from the cloud. The player must give a charge (positive or negative) to try to make it hit the opponent's building. The first to destroy the other's building wins the game.</p>",
