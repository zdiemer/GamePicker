The aim is to score as many points as possible by hitting the submarines that move across the screen. Small subs are worth 15 points while the bigger ones are worth five. The player has 25 depth charges and the game ends when they have been used up. Unlike the arcade game the destroyer moves by itself and the player's input is limited to pressing a single button to drop the charges at the right time.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Programs for the Cosmac Elf: Music and Games</em> is a booklet which describes various programs for the COSMAC ELF, including means to use the computer as a music box by attaching a speaker to the computer or picking up signals with an AM radio. The game does not have graphics aside from using the hexadecimal display and Q-light. A number of games are included in the booklet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bridg-it</strong> - An implementation of the board game by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/18030/hasbro-inc/\">Hasbro</a> players connect points on a playing field trying to bridge one side to the other. The AI uses an algorithm which makes it play well against an expert and poorly against a novice, but it will always win.S</li>\n<li><strong>Tic-Tac-Toe</strong> - A typical implementation of the classic pen and paper game. The computer uses an incomplete defensive algorithm which an advanced player can exploit to win one in three games.</li>\n<li><strong>Morra</strong> - The \"three fingers game\" is similar to rock, paper, scissors. The player and computer simultaneously must show one, two or three fingers. If one player guessed correctly but not the other that player earns points equal to the total number of fingers shown. The computer uses the optimum strategy and thus can't lose, but the player can try to get a draw.</li>\n</ul>",

When playing manually two players can play against each other. The batting player must move the bat left or right to hit the ball. When the ball is hit it can turn into a bunt, popup, ground ball, fly ball or line drive randomly. Each will result in a play such as a single, double, triple, home run or out. The batter can also receive a walk to first base. After nine innings the game ends even if there's a tie.</p>",

The book contains the code but also a tape with the programs. The programs contain two games, the others are a text editor, a machine language disassembler, a CHIP-8 Editor, a character set designer, and a \"messager\" that can display the designed character sets.</p>\n<p>The games are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Space Wars</em> - An action game in which the player must shoot Klingon space ships. The player has 30 shots from their spaceship and must try to destroy as many Klingons as possible. The player can only take four hits before their ship is destroyed. When hit the controls also briefly become unresponsive.</li>\n<li><em>Surround</em> - A <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Snake+variant\">Snake variant</a> where the player controls a snake and must hit targets on the playing field. The \"snakes\" have a predetermined size and will grow from their initial point size to that size and no longer. The player plays against the computer and two playing fields can be selected, one with borders and one that wraps around in all directions.</li>\n</ul>",

Toggling the middle bit also toggles adjacent bits (this time excluding diagonally) and when toggling the top or bottom bit only the adjacent bits on the same row are toggled, and similarly only the bits in the same column are toggled when flipping a bit on the left or right.</p>",
