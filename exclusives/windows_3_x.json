        "description": "<p><em>Power Politics</em> is a campaign simulation for serious students of political science. You create a presidential candidate with various strengths and weaknesses, or use one from the past 30 years to see if you can rewrite history. You must set his or her schedule, and decide which issues to address and whether to take a conservative or liberal stance on them, how much to spend on advertising, what to say in the ads, what to do with your running mate, and whether to use dirty tricks. The more support your candidate wins, the more contributions will pour in. If your polls aren't good enough, you can hire a spin doctor.</p>",

The pilot receives the mission of a lifetime: he has to to locate and eventually destroy Lord Iron, whose minions are out in space in at attempt to subdue other inhabitants of the galaxy. The gameplay is divided into two phases: space combat simulator in the vein of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=wing+commander\">Wing Commander</a>, and first-person puzzle-solving adventure. The player can pilot many types of spacecraft, such as fighters and cargo vessels, and engage enemy ships in battle using four main weapon types: lasers, remote-controlled missiles, rockets, and aft mines. During the adventure phase, the player explores the environment in a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Myst\">Myst</a>-style fashion, collecting items and solving puzzles. Full-motion video sequences are used to advance the plot.</p>",

Millennium Auction pits you against a group of bidders all trying to get the best deals without buying something that has no resale value.</p>\n<p>After picking your character, you proceed to your first auction.  Take the time to examine what items will be in the auction (you can see what everything looks like and read about the items as well) and then do some research.  Talk with the other bidders to see what they like or don't like.</p>\n<p>Check the newspaper, radio, and more as you see what items might be worth something when trying to sell them later.  Is it worth getting Bill Clinton's Saxophone?  Will you be able to make a profit on it if you bid on it?  Your research will help you make that decision.</p>\n<p>Items available to bid on in the game include many real items such as the Mona Lisa and Starry Night paintings as well as fake items that can still be worth something in this game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Inner Space</em> is an arcade-style shooter taking place inside a rather familiar environment: the player's computer. Evil forces have invaded, seizing control of the player's system, and setting loose program icons to cause mayhem. It's up to the player to round up the renegade icons, all the while battling other hazards inside the <em>inner space</em> of the player's computer, and working with--or fighting--the other AI-controlled pilots that populate the system.</p>\n<p>The game builds its gameworld dynamically from the contents of the player's hard drive, so the game never plays exactly the same way twice. There are racetracks, a dueling arena where the player can settle scores with rivals without interference from the IS Enforcers, and a strange <em>Inner Demon</em> whom the player must ultimately learn to defeat in order to win the game. The player can select from dozens of ships and their variations to play, or create them using the Ship Factory, and upgrade the player's ship capabilities with weapons and equipment bought from the ambulance or salvaged from destroyed ships. The game also includes a screen saver.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>THiNK-X</em> is a puzzle game in which you have to clear playing fields by matching identical objects in a limited amount of time. Items can be matched horizontally and vertically as doublets, or as triplets as long as three of a kind touch, but not diagonally. You have to plan carefully, as no objects are to remain at the end of the game. Items are moved by clicking them and assigning a new position on a horizontal line. If you make a mistake, you can rebuild the original lay-out, but time keeps running.</p>\n<p>There are 168 levels divided over 28 playing fields with 6 difficulty modes. An increased difficulty is not only reflected in the amount of time, but also by different blocks and items with special features, making all the levels unique. There are toys in the Easy mode, numbers in Medium, letters in Hard and Extreme, coloured ducks in Funny, and in Tricky you play with vases that turn into blocks when matched.</p>\n<p>Certain levels include special pieces. Marplots can be used to block shooters that destroy pieces, weakies slowly fade causing items on top to fall down, and bridges are temporary structures over which you can move pieces in the air. Elementals temporarily hold pieces, or are used to get rid of marplots, while shooters completely destroy items. There are also moving bridges, called wanderers, timebombs (similar to weakies, but with a destructive effect), elevators to transport items to the top of the level and switches that alter the playing field.</p>",

The subtitle promises \u201cTwisted Arcade Games for Twisted Minds\u201d. In truth, the three games included are rather crude adaptations of Breakout, Pong and Baseball. </p>\n<p>The main attraction is an interactive version of the dispute between the two cartoon characters Joe and his Boss. Both humiliate each other with bizarre weaponry. For example, Joe blows his Boss\u2019 head off with a cannon; his superior takes his revenge in working Joe\u2019s head with a lawnmower. You may choose the type of assault. </p>\n<p>Additional material on the CD includes a couple of uninspired \u201cflying heads\u201d screensavers, nice desktop wallpapers and a collection of icons and sound samples.</p>\n<p>All of the animation in Take Your Best Shot is taken from the animated short film <em>Push Comes To Shove</em> (1991). The program contains no further, let alone new art.\nMore information on Bill Plympton can be found in the trivia and links sections.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Heartfelt, but rather unrealistic wishes like ruling the world, unlimited processing power or an evening playing poker with three celebrities usually fall into the sphere of competence of a fairy. In case one happens to show up in your home: don\u2019t ask for that poker game. That\u2019s already been taken care of, thanks to New World Computing. NWC-mastermind Jon Van Caneghem invited three class B TV celebrities of the mid-90s for a day of green-screen filming. The result is called Multimedia Celebrity Poker.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re into TV series, then you\u2019ll probably have no trouble recognizing the faces of your opponents. Sitting at the poker table are <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/16609/jonathan-frakes/\">Jonathan \u201eRiker\u201c Frakes (Star Trek: Next Generation)</a>, appearing somewhat tight-lipped; talkative comedian <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/29025/joe-piscopo/\">Joe Piscopo (Saturday Night Live)</a>, showing off his array of impersonations; and aging starlet <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/29024/morgan-fairchild/\">Morgan Fairchild (Hotel, Falcon Crest)</a>, sitting stiff and generally trying not to look too lost. Digitized video clips, seamlessly integrated into the main frame, depict all actions and movements of the stars -- dealing, calling, playing cards. Separate clips for the three actors are played simultaneously to avoid \u201efreezing\u201c of single persons; all are continuously in motion. The celebrities comment on the their cards and your success to create a relaxed and intimate atmosphere. The number of different statements is quite limited though; prepare to learn those one-liners by heart.</p>\n<p>Multimedia Celebrity Poker knows eight different variants of poker. You may play combinations of five cards or seven, stud or draw, lo-ball or high, deuces wild or normal. In any case, it\u2019s always you against the computer; a multiplayer option is not included. In addition to a relaxed round among friends, you can choose to advance levels in a tournament. You win if all opponents are broke, although nobody will undress at that point. Luckily. The program\u2019s poker skill is mediocre; it\u2019s playing fairly straight, rarely risking a bluff. The playing style of the three celebrities does not differ.</p>\n<p>Ready to join the game? On second thought, maybe you should wait for the fairy.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Endorsed by pro golfer Greg Norman, this golf sim places you on the Medalist Golf Club stationed in Florida (which Norman himself helped to design), and Norman acts as your host in the course, giving fly-by narrations and insight on the course, as well as accompanying you on golfing rounds.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is standard golf fare, with the addition of two modes: arcade and simulation. On arcade mode you have the usual 3-stage power bar for your swing. While on simulation mode you just click whenever you want the ball to go and your golfer swings. The trick is on simulation mode: 40 editable statistics are taken into account for the accuracy, power, etc of the swing. So depending on how you have customized your golfer you'll have a good long-range game, but be weak in the wet, etc..</p>\n<p>Graphics consist of mostly digitized photo-realistic images.</p>",

Your mission here is to manage the aircrafts in Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport's airspace from the control tower. There is no \"winning\" in this game; you play rounds of varying difficulty in which you must direct planes through waypoints, clear planes for takeoff, change altitude, etc. without them crashing or colliding in mid-air. You can select your difficulty from a series of pre-defined options or make your custom rounds by selecting parameters such as numbers of planes, time available, etc.</p>\n<p>The game screen is divided in two, with the upper half being your view from the tower, and where animations for different events happen (crashes, etc.) and the lower half the being the main game interface where you have your radar and communications interfaces.</p>\n<p>In addition to the main game, the CD includes a series of complementary materials regarding planes and other reference info.</p>",

You have to set routes for the planes and organize punctual arrivals. </p>\n<p>The game is also featuring emergencies, to make your task more difficult. </p>\n<p>Tracon was used to train professional ATCs in the early nineties. Then Wesson decided to develop special simulation units for professional users and continue the Tracon series as entertainment.</p>",

It is played in real-time, and contains some real-time strategy/action elements.  Multiplayer mode is playable over LAN (IPX only) or serial/modem connection. It was written for Windows 3.1, but works well in any Windows environment.</p>\n<p>Like Spaceward Ho!, it doesn't take itself too seriously and has cutesy graphics.  Unlike most 4X games, though, it is a \"beer-and-pretzels\" game, designed with a short-but-adjustable time limit (the default is 30 minutes).</p>",

        "description": "<p>Proliferation is a formerly-shareware World War III strategy game for up to six players, human- or computer-controlled.  Nuclear weapons, both tactical and strategic, have proliferated throughout the nations of the world, and the five largest nuclear powers, after failed efforts to militarily compel the smaller nuclear-armed nations to disarm, have plunged the world into global war.  You take the role of one of the five major nuclear powers, seeking to extend your sphere of influence and eventually become the dominant power.</p>\n<p>The game is graphically simple but has a high degree of depth and complexity.  You manage both conventional and nuclear forces, economic factors, and military production.  The main commodities are population, food, and oil, and the latter two must be maintained in sufficient quantity to allow the former to produce.  In addition, all players must worry about increasing global and local radiation levels resulting from the use of nuclear weapons.</p>\n<p>The author, Dion Kurczek of Silicon Commander Games, has released the game to the public as freeware.</p>",

However gone is the storyline, as Master Edition puts the player into instant combat. Opponents can be chosen from a list of AI generals or connected to by using modem or LAN connections. Not only that, but this time it's FASTER real time combat. You won't have time to sit there and coordinate your strategy. The missiles and the marines will be landing any minute! Furthermore the game has been enhanced for windows and takes advantage of dragging objects from one window to another in order to make attacks as well as providing more control over metal marines in enemy camps. A variety of landscape and over 20 detailed command scenarios will give you plenty of landscape to rage with war.</p>",

In each level you must catch and kill prey such as gazelles and wildebeests, but avoid deadly hippos and leopards. There are over 20 species in the game which behave realistically and can be killed (including human tourists!). The game uses a Doom-like 3D engine, and allows you to play ten levels with different objectives through a first or third person perspective. The game also contains various educational video clips about lions and the Serengeti.</p>",

If you kill the beginning or the end of the Squirmer, you will shorten him. But if you kill a part from the mid, you will divide him into two Squirmers, and so on.</p>\n<p>The Squirmer moves from top left to top right, then moving a row down, then moving back to left. If a mushroom is in the way, he will change the row until he can move normally. You, however, can move your ship to any place inside the bottom halve of the playfield.</p>\n<p>The foes in the game (flea, spider, and scorpion) will hunt you, if they catch you, you have lost a life. This is also the case when the Squirmer got you.</p>\n<p>But the game also offers two friends. A butterfly, which will leave a cocoon some times. If you fire at this cocoon, it it explode and kill anything in range. The other friend is the snail, which sometimes is above a mushroom, shoot at this mushroom and he will give you some of his powers (Spread Gun, Laser, or Invincibility).</p>",

The more levels you play, the faster will be the game, but also the more special bricks you encounter (exploding bricks, which destroys adjacent bricks; extra lives; etc.) and the more different background themes you will see.</p>",

There are some 139 real world nations to choose from.</p>\n<p>Each country is assigned an ideology. Nations with the same ideology as yours will be easier to conquer and occupy, while nations with different ideologies will put up greater resistance.\nIdeological factions include the Populists, Militarists, Socialists, Realists, Pacifists, Optimists, Pessimists, and Feminists.</p>\n<p>There are two modes of play: Standard and Real World Simulation. The Standard game plays out similarly to Risk.

So the player, controlling James T. Kirk, commander of the original NCC-1701 Enterprise, is ordered to stop that invasion.</p>\n<p><em>WinTrek</em> is Star Trek simulation game, where the player virtually controls every aspect of the Enterprise, including those that would normally be done by the crew.</p>\n<p>For navigating the Enterprise through the sectors and quadrants, the player does not \"drive\" her, but instead controls the navigation station directly (setting course, whereby any of the 360 degrees can be used, and setting speed limits, both impulse and warp). During combat, the player has to manage shields, coordinate phaser fire and photon torpedoes, including the control of how much dilithium (fuel) is invested into shields and weapons. Finally, the player must manage the dilithium fuel (i.e. refilling at starbases) and make sure that the ship doesn't break apart (damage system).</p>\n<p>The game is won when the enemy armada is destroyed, and lost when the armada attacks Earth, or when the player-controlled ship runs out of fuel or explodes. Both the number of enemy ships and the days available to the player are randomly set when the game is started. </p>\n<p>The game offers six difficulty levels, ranging from Admiral (expert) to Expandable Crewman (easiest). In-game Computer Station acts like a computer operation system, allowing the player to get information not visible at the other stations (e.g. retrieve the position of the starbases). Information is displayed in 11 sub-windows of the game window, which are all re-sizable and movable.</p>",

As in every point-and-click adventure game you have your inventory, essential to solve the puzzles, though there aren't different cursors for different actions.</p>",

Communicate orders directly to the pilot from the tower console, warn of any dangers or tell them to use another runway (if available). Try to operate one of three airports or take on a whole scenario, which gradually progresses from a typical airport to O'Hare in Chicago, one of the busiest in the world. Each scenario offers flexibility to select a time of day, the number of runways and the rate of traffic with a maximum of 150 planes every two minutes.</p>\n<p>The main view outside of the tower is a total 3D 360-degree display. Switch to tracking or binoculars displays to closer watch planes. Several instruments help to make more informed decisions such as a compass, wind gauges, a clock, and a panel of shortcut buttons for quick and easy access to different functions from control over lights, arrival and departure details, bright display Airport Surface Detection Equipment (ASDE), and viewing angles.</p>\n<p>Points are earned for the ability to manage issuing commands, while they are lost for runway separations or crashes, the ultimate aim being to gain highly sought-after perks including the award for controller-of-the-month, time-off with pay or paycheck bonus.</p>\n<p>Multi-player games are possible over a modem or null-modem cable to owners of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1674/microsoft-flight-simulator-v50/\">Microsoft Flight Simulator v5.1</a>, enabling a pilot (second player) to come in to land at the player's airport.</p>\n<p>*Follows FAA and Transport Canada rules.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Race Track</em> is an interesting conversion of a simple pen &amp; paper game. It could best be described as a \"strategic turn based racing simulation\" -- not bad for such a simple game!</p>\n<p>The game is played on a race track divided into small squares. Gameplay is simple: At each turn, you are moved by an amount of squares depending on your last move (your velocity or speed), which you can modify by selecting one of the neighboring squares of the position where you'd land by not doing anything. </p>\n<p>This may sound complicated, but it is actually quite simple and is a quite realistic physical modelling of braking, accelerating and steering. The difficulty is to find the right speed to take the curves. If you're too fast, you won't be able to brake in time -- either you'll crash of you'll have to brake until your not moving anymore, which costs time, so you should think in advance about when to accelerate.</p>\n<p>There are also other difficulties like oil slicks which make you unable to modify the speed of your vehicle, or pit stops where you will have to stop before continuing the race.</p>\n<p>The game offers three predefined race tracks and an editor to create your own tracks. There are also different playing modes, you can race the clock, trying to beat the \"champion\" of the track (the player who used the least number of turns), or you can race the champion himself (you see his traces and try to beat him), or you can race against a friend in a two-player mode.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Very much a <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/snake-games\">snake game</a>, <em>Rattler Race</em> adds a few twists to the long-held conventions of the genre (those being: you guide a snake from a top-down perspective, always in forward motion; it eats its targets and grows in length, but dies should it collide with any obstacles): in addition to a competing snake foiling your routes, a ball bounces around the play-field, Pong-style, killing your snake should the ball ricochet against its head.</p>\n<p>The other standout qualities are largely cosmetic: periodically enemy movement \"freezes\", giving the player a period of free motion; the opposing snake will also \"eat\" your targets (here \"apples\" -- occasionally bonus \"golden apples\") and grow longer, though it doesn't seek them out; gameplay can be conducted with as many as three opposing snakes and three bouncing balls complicating the playfield at once; you head for the exit once all apples are eaten, but the enemy snake(s) can exit instead, restarting the level. Triumph against all these odds and you get 29 more levels of similar gameplay!</p>\n<p>This unremarkable clone is largely known on account of having been included in the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4004/microsoft-entertainment-pack-for-windows/\">Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows</a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Borrowing certain gameplay conventions from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Qix\">Qix</a>, <em>JezzBall</em> presents another scenario forcing the player to divide and conquer a 2D playfield by whittling away slivers of it until it is at only 25% (or less) of its original size.</p>\n<p>The complicating factor here are balls, more with every level, bouncing off the edges of the continuous playfield and, incidentally, quite lethal to the player's marker, only tangible while in the act of diminishing the playfield by marking off areas no longer to be used. The player can choose to trim horizontal or vertical segments -- depending on which axis they expect the bouncing ball to intercept soonest -- and the boring apparatus used fires off in opposite directions simultaneously, meaning the cross-section generally starts being cut from the middle and works its way toward the outside edges... all while keeping an eye on how close those balls are bouncing.</p>\n<p>The apparatus is slow, and until the entire cross-section is completed, its entire span is at risk of being hit. The two sides of the dividing sweep are independent from each other, so if one side is intercepted by a ball while in the process of trimming, the other side continues unabated, resulting in a half-complete division.</p>\n<p>This game became famous after being distributed as part of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/24428/microsoft-entertainment-pack-4/\">Microsoft Entertainment Pack 4</a> of Windows 3.x games, returning in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/2000/the-best-of-microsoft-entertainment-pack/\">the Best of Microsoft Entertainment Pack</a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dr. Drago's Madcap Chase</em> (a.k.a. <em>Die total verr\u00fcckte Rallye</em>) is a strategy game for up to eight players with similarities to board games like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Monopoly\">Monopoly</a>. </p>\n<p>The players join a rally through Europe and North Africa which consists of several stages. At the beginning of each stage a TV moderator names the capital of a country. The one who gets there first will win a lot of money. At first there are only Western European countries available but eventually the Berlin Wall falls and you can enter the former Eastern bloc.</p>\n<p>You play on a map of Europe consisting of many fields merged with each other through lines. Before every turn a player dices and then he can move his figure over the fields. You can freely decide the route to your target but you have to notice on which field you would end your turn. There are:* Red fields: When you end your turn on a red field, you'll lose money.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Blue fields: Money will be credited to your account.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Yellow fields: You get a playing card. You can use these cards before every turn to your own advantage (i.e. use five dices instead of one) or to your opponent's disadvantage (i.e. having him transferred to a corner of the map).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Purple fields: On a purple field you can buy or sell cards.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gray fields: Gray fields are cities. In a city you can buy buildings and earn rent every turn. When you own every building in a city, you have a monopoly and earn more rent. Contrary to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Monopoly\">Monopoly</a> you don't have to pay anything when you come to a city where one of the other players have buildings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Black and white fields: These fields represent the capital of a country. Buying buildings there is much more expensive but you will earn more rent.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another aspect of the game is Dr. Drago. Drago is played by the computer and appears after stage one and will follow the player who had the highest distance to the target of the previous stage. After every turn Drago will waste parts of your money, sell or buy buildings to terrible prices or destroy your cards. To get rid of him you can use a Drago playing card (if you own one and Drago has not ripped it to pieces yet) or overtake one of the players. When you pass them, Drago will leave you and chase your opponent. </p>\n<p>The winner of the game is the one who has the most money on his account after all stages. You could even win without winning a single stage but it's more difficult because you won't make that much profit with trying to end your turns on blue fields. And of course, Drago will haunt you the whole time when you are cruising in Northern Africa while all the stages end somewhere else.</p>",

Each of 25 time-constrained levels has a different layout of gopher holes, some closer together than others, requiring quick reflexes on the player's part to drag the mouse over to the new gopher sighting and click on it before they retreat back underground. On top of three difficulty settings, this game also features an optional gore toggle, for those who like their gophers extra-squishy.</p>",

The objective of the game is to match three or more blocks (representing jewels) of the same color. The blocks come falling from the top of the screen in groups of three. These can then be matched either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. They will then be removed from the playfield, and the remaining blocks will fall down to fill the gaps. The game is over when the pile of blocks reaches the top of the screen. In addition to the normal jewels, there are magic jewels that causes all the jewels of a certain color to be removed. </p>\n<p>After 150 jewels has been collected, the game level will increase by one. The higher level the player is at, the more points he will be awarded. The appearance of the blocks can be changed by choosing one of five additional jewel sets. Some of the available sets are fruits, letters and flags.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Over fifteen hundred years ago, the dwarves built the mines and the city above them, Dejenol. After centuries of digging, a floor gave way deep in the mines, and monsters began to pour out, killing the miners. The mines were eventually sealed, and remained so for over a thousand years. Now, the city elders have decided to reopen the mines, and cleanse them of their evil inhabitants. Having nearly run out of experienced adventurers, the city elders have decided to train new adventurers to take up this task. You are one such adventurer, tasked with searching and making safe The Depths of Dejenol.</p>\n<p>The player forms a party by creating several characters of various races, and causing each to join some guilds to teach them useful skills. The party then adventures in the mines to gain experience, items, and gold, which may be spent at any of the several stores in order to buy equipment, companions, or information from the seer, as well as to gain levels at a guild or revive fallen characters.</p>\n<p>Mordor has fifteen dungeon levels in addition to the town, 366 different items, and 400 different monsters, providing many hours of play.</p>",

This program commemorates their efforts, indicating a line of happily compliant soldiers, alive, in mental contrast to the stilled parade of \"crispy critters\" along the turkey shoot of the Highway of Death back to Basra.</p>\n<p>To drive home the point of what a straw man the opposing forces ended up being, the program runs through to completion upon execution without any input needed from the player; however, if the author was more prescient, he might have instructed the program to lie dormant for twelve years and then fire up some horrifying no-win program like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/28330/forbiddenexe/\">Forbidden.exe</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/30085/punishment/\">Punishment</a> for what John McCain suggests might be ten thousand years.</p>",

The tiles are then revealed again, and the player can see whether his guess was correct. A successful guess gives 10 points. The game can be played at one of the 10 levels - the higher the level, the faster the tiles move.</p>\n<p>There are two game modes: the \"Single Level Shuffle\", where the player chooses the level he wishes to play on, and has an opportunity to make 20 guesses (correct or not) before the game ends; and the \"Progressive Level Shuffle\", which is based on the same rules, but the level increases with each successful guess and decreases with each failure.</p>\n<p>After each guess, the player can see an instant replay of the tiles re-arranging, but in slow motion and with the tiles revealed.</p>",

Being the gentleman you are, you kindly offer her a ride to her destination. In brief hesitation, her eyes engage in silent conversation with yours. She enters the car as you start your engine. From there, the adventure begins. First intimate encounter with her will give you some pleasure, but more experience you will get by next interactive actions.</p>\n<p>With TFUI(tm) 2.0 Technology (Touch Feel User Interface), an icon-based 3-D interface that mimics human spoken language, you are allowed to touch and sexually interact with Rebecca, in real-time, from the first-person view. So, in the game you should stimulate the woman with advanced sexual functions: tongue, self-stimulation, special toys as well as your own hands and body.</p>\n<p>The game also includes X-Director(tm). Literally sitting in the director's seat, you take full control of the sex scenes in FMV and direct Rebecca to do as you command.

Nightshade was imprisoned in an attempt by Garth to obtain the secret location of the hidden Land of Dragons through torture, and now Nightshade will scour every square foot of Garth's palace, from the subterranean mines to kitchens, libraries, gardens and torture chambers, to find what he needs to overthrow the genocidal Garth: the lost sword of The Great One.</p>\n<p>Holding to certain interface conventions established earlier by ICOM's MacVentures and World Builder games, this is largely achieved through pixel-hunting, sweeping the mouse over the screen in search of hot zones that change the mouse cursor into a new shape allowing him to pick up, converse with, operate or use an inventory item on the object beneath the cursor -- quite often a hidden switch revealing a hidden passageway.</p>",

In addition to the \"fishfest\" mode, which reproduces the original game's simple schoolfish-eating game (but makes it competitive -- who can eat the most the fastest?), this game also takes a nod from the FPS revolution its parent companies spawned and features two- and four-player deathmatches (aka \"dopematch\"es) where the players must line themselves up properly to eat a schoolfish precisely at the moment when they're facing an opponent, as the food quickly gets converted and expelled back out as a kind of shot. Four dopes enter. One dope leaves. That is the dopematch law in <em>Dopefish Forever!</em></p>",

This function will stay active until another special tile is hit.</li>\n<li>Blue L-bricks: The ball is locked and can be set free for double-ball play when hit again.</li>\n<li>Grey arrow bricks: If hit twice this brick will produce a permanent brick at the bottom of the screen and by this confine your racket movements to one side of the screen for few seconds.</li>\n<li>Red F-bricks: If a blocker is present the paddle will be turned into a gun for a few seconds allowing you to destroy the blocker.</li>\n<li>Green S-bricks: Hitting these bricks will remove one of the stamps covering the cartoons. The faster you remove these bricks the more points you get.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The unregistered version features only eight levels.</p>",

Compiled from early FORTRAN and C sources, this port makes use of its early GUI by presenting a text output window, through which the game communicates to the player, as well as a player input window with buttons to streamline common commands (typically directional in nature) and a text entry box for more esoteric words (such as, for instance, \"xyzzy\".) The story and plot, such as it is (grab the treasures, try not to die) is much the same as other ports from its primeval source. This version, as do many, offers 350 points to be amassed through player action and treasure collection.</p>",

Norris, a ten year old boy who is caught in his dreams. Pieces of imagination and memory mix together, and beneath his happy thoughts an evil darkness looms. </p>\n<p>The game is based around use-item-on-location puzzles, distinguishing itself with its surreal environments. The gameplay area is split into two sections. The top of the screen shows an image of current location and the point and click interface. The bottom of the screen features a status box that shows additional text descriptions of items, actions, and locations.</p>\n<p>In <em>Dare to Dream 3</em>, Tyler must travel into his darkest and most corrupted dreams in order to defeat Christian and finally free himself.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Battle Sat</em> is a shareware clone of the classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Battleship\">Battleship</a> board game. However, here the conflict has left the oceans and has instead gone to the skies above.</p>\n<p>The player takes turns against the computer's AI in a race to destroy the opponent's Sats (or Satellites). Gameplay is very similar to the classic Battleship - There are three grids on the screen: The left grid shows your opponent's playfield and tells you if you've hit one of his Sats, or if you missed. The middle grid allows you to choose what area you will attack during your turn. The right grid displays your own Sats, their status, and the places where the opponent has already attacked. This continues until one side loses all their Sats.</p>\n<p>The main difference between the Battleship board game and this Windows-based implementation is that there are five Sat pieces in play, all different sizes. While the board game has two pieces that are two blocks in size, this version contains one piece that's two blocks in size, and one piece that's one block in size.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Brain Games For Windows</em> contains seven puzzle games bundled together. The games included are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Achi</em> - You play against the CPU. The game is similar to Tic-Tac-Toe; however, if a stalemate occurs, each player can move one of their tiles and possibly get a game-winning line.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Bastille</em> - The object of the game is to remove buttons from the game board. You do so by moving one button over another; you can only jump over one button at a time, and the place where you land has to be empty. The game includes five different button patterns, each one more difficult than the last.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/38966/battle-sat/\">Battle Sat</a></em> - Originally released as a standalone game, this is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Battleship\">Battleship</a> clone where you must shoot down your opponents Satellites before he shoots down your own. The game plays exactly like Battleship - you select points in a grid and fire at them. If you land a hit, the point will turn red, and you'll have a clue as to where the enemy's Satellites are located. The player who destroys the enemy's Satellites first wins.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Double Block</em> - This is a simple Memory game. You have to uncover tiles and match them before your opponent does so you can win the game. You can change the opponent's skill level and the colors used in the grid; a single player mode is also available.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Jumper</em> - A simple puzzle game, you have to move the red blocks on the right side to the left side of the screen. The blocks will only move if there is an empty space next to it, or if you've moved a block right next to it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Knight</em> - The object of the game is to swap the position of the Red Knights (on top) with the Blue Knights (below) in 16 moves by using nothing but knight moves.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Tic-Tac-Toe</em> - The classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Place Xs or Os in a line across, down or diagonally before your opponent does the same.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p>Skat 2010 is a simulation of the card game skat. There are many variants, but here is the principle: The game is usually played with three persons. Two of the players are playing against a single one but are not allowed to communicate. Each card has a value and one suit is called \"Trumpf\". In every round each player looses one of his card and the one which played the \"Trumpf\" card with the highest value gets all the played cards. If no \"Trumpf\" is played the highest value scores. At the end each player counts the values of his cards. The goal for the single player is to get more points than the other two combined.</p>\n<p>The main feature of Skat 2010 is the integration of many local skat variants. If your favorite rule set is not included you can create it yourself with the freely adjustable rules. There is also a highscore list and speech.</p>\n<p>In the shareware version you can't change the rule set and there are several small restrictions while playing.</p>",

There are three different units: Infantry, cavalry and artillery. If you select a unit, the game gives you a lot of information, e.g. morale, exhaustion or even anecdotes from the real Civil War.</p>\n<p>Movement or combat orders are all issued with the mouse. After combat calculations, you are notified about the losses - if desired even permanent on the map screen, which always shows the whole battle field and can't be zoomed in.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there is a second game mode where you can pursue the whole real battle.

        "description": "<p><em>High Command</em> is a tactical strategy game. The game field, which looks a lot like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Minesweeper\">Minesweeper</a>, is divided into squares. Each square is either neutral, hostile or belongs to you. Some squares are cities which have a high point value. Your goal is to reach as much points as possible by conquer the enemy's squares and cities. Similar to the board game Risk you have to move soldiers from a bordering square into the hostile square to seize it. But there is a catch: Not only the number of your and the enemy's troops in a square affect the chances - the troops in the bordering squares have a strong influence of the combat outcome too.</p>\n<p>The game features three enemy AIs (aggressive, defensive and balanced), five historical and fictional scenarios. and an editor to build your own or random scenarios. The maximum number of war parties are 4, AI or human. In the shareware version you aren't allowed to save and there is only one scenario available.</p>",

This story is told in pictures in which the player can click on several objects to trigger animations and sounds. There are also quizzes where the environmental knowledge is tested. In the video section, there are several videos with wide spread topics to watch, e.g. about exhaust reduction or the dehydration of a lake. </p>\n<p>Outside the story, the player can choose to play a few other games like a detective game where in front of a keyhole running figures have to be recognised. There are also other pictures which work like the ones in the story mode.</p>",

To solve these puzzles the player has to search the tomb and perceive and understand the engravings of this old civilization. This knowledge is mostly used to put old machines into operation or deactivate deadly traps. The player quickly finds a note book of another archaeologist who apparently already explored most of the complex. This serves as a subtle in-game help system - it doesn't give the solutions but hints to the nature of the puzzles.</p>\n<p>The CD-ROM version adds additional music and voice acting and is not to be confused with the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6714/entombed-enhanced/\">Entombed Enhanced</a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Space Bastards</em> is a Space Invaders clone with raytraced graphics, lots of weapon power-ups and a two player mode. You move your spaceship at the bottom of the screen, firing missiles while dodging shots from the endless waves of aliens.</p>\n<p>The aliens move in a left to right pattern and speed up as their numbers decrease. Very slowly, the game gets more difficult as the aliens will return fire more and more. Every now and then, a UFO flies across the top of the screen, which drops a weapon power-up when you shoot it. Catch the power-up to temporary increase your fire power. A weapon bar will appear next to your score, and after a short time it will run out. After that you return to your default weapon, the slow firing missile which doesn't do that much damage.</p>\n<p>There are lots of different power-ups weapons. The green slime blobs do the least damage but are still better than your default gun. The laser beam cuts through columns of aliens like butter. With the 3-way shot and 6-way shot you can spray the aliens like bugs. The grenades explode on impact taking out the surrounding aliens. Laser grenades also explode on impact but they then shoot two laser beams side ways, taking out an entire row of aliens. The flamethrower almost works like an eraser, simply move from left to right to wipe out the enemies. And finally, there's the nuke, a rare power-up that instantly kills all aliens on screen.</p>\n<p>The longer you play, the more the aliens fire back at you, the more you really need power-ups to survive. If your weapon runs out right at the beginning of a wave of aliens, you're stuck with your standard missile weapon which can only take out one alien at a time. So you will have to find a certain rhythm to defeating the waves of aliens, making sure you always have a power-up when a new wave arrives.</p>\n<p>You can play solo or with two players, which makes the game even more frantic. If you don't have someone to play with, you can even play co-op with the computer controlling the second spaceship.</p>",

This is done by revealing empty fields, these contain numbers indicating how many mines are directly adjacent, ranging from 0 (no number, automatically reveals adjacent 0-fields) up to 8 (completely surrounded by mines).</p>\n<p>If a mine is clicked on, all mines are revealed and the game ends. If all mines are marked, the player wins the game.</p>\n<p>The game can be played in three game modes, increasing the size of the playfield and the amount of mines in there.</p>\n<p><strong>Solitaire:</strong></p>\n<p>In this card game the goal is to put all the cards sorted (ace, two, ..., queen, king) by suit into the four fields at the top.</p>\n<p>When starting a game, the target fields are empty, the main field consists of 7 piles of cards, whereby only the top one is visible, also in an ascending amount (left side one card, right side 7 cards), and the rest of the cards are in one pile at top left.</p>\n<p>Cards can only be moved from one pile to another when putting a lower card of the opposite color on a higher card, when the pile is empty, kings can be placed there, and finally, when the target piles are empty, only aces can be put there (then twos on aces, etc.).</p>\n<p>Depending on the setting, the player either takes one or three cards from the top left pile.</p>\n<p>When all cards are sorted in the target piles, the player has won the game.

A match consists of several games in a row.</p>\n<p>In order to win, the player must either avoid hearts (worth one point) and the spade queen (13 points), or acquiring all hearts and the spade queen in a match (this is called \"shoot the moon\"; if the player manages that, all the other players receive 26 points at the end of the match).</p>\n<p>While playing, the player must follow the played color, unless the player does't has this color, then any color can be played.</p>\n<p><em>Note:</em> Hearts can be played alone or against other players using LAN.</p>",

You are on your way to Processing Plant 3 in orbit of Helicon 4, but it won't be an easy journey. You will be hit by an asteroid and attacked by an alien vessel. Your main power conversion chamber will be damaged, so a new power cell is needed. With your scanners you will locate an alien planet, NPC-372, that has a compatible power source. After landing on the planet with your space tug, you have to find a way to enter a strange massive structure. The power cell is located deep below the structure and is guarded by a skull-like alien device. Only if you manage to bypass it and get the power cell, you will be will be able to continue your journey. </p>\n<p>Mission 9 is a 3rd person point and click space adventure. The player has to become familiar with the ship's compartments, learn to handle its computer, and search for various items, such as tools to repair damage or a space suit to be able to leave the ship.   </p>\n<p>During the journey the player will get instructions by the ship\u2019s computer voice (no captions). Manoeuvring on the ship is done by clicking on the centre and the sides of the screen. Within the ship a tram can be used to go to the different locations. The game has no visible inventory, but by clicking on the left bottom corner a voice informs the player which inventory items have been collected. The saving system is unlimited.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This early, authorized freeware remake of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/14886/deflektor/\">puzzle game from 1987</a> updates the graphics and sounds while maintaining the original gameplay. Each level is a puzzle room filled with obstacles and viewed from above, where the objective is to use a series of mirrors to guide a laser beam towards a receiver device and complete the stage. The mirrors are stationary, but can be rotated to deflect the light to several directions, with some turning automatically all the time. The player must configure the mirrors and carefully avoid the mines and walls that reflect the laser back to itself, causing the emitting device to overload and explode. Bomb detonators have to be activated and destroyed to open a passage to the receiver. Other features change the behavior of the laser: the prism bends the light in random 90\u00ba angles; the optical fiber nodes act as a portals, transporting the beam to another place of the board; logical doors have internal mirrors that absorb or deflect the laser when hit at the correct orientation. This remake received a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/45297/deflektor-x4/\">new version in 2006</a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Paulie Python is a snake that is hungry for mice. Your task is to guide the green python through various scrolling levels and eat all mice in each of them. However, the mice are often scattered around the level, so you have to search for them first. With each eaten mouse, Paulie grows a bit, making it more difficult to avoid his own tail. You must neither crash into the tail nor the walls, otherwise you will lose a life. Another hazard you might encounter are white balls that bounce around and kill your character when they hit his head. Keep in mind that Paulie's tail stays the same size when you advance to the next level. The same happens when Paulie dies and has to restart a level, while all previously eaten mice reappear. This means that the python grows to an enormous size during the course of the game.</p>\n<p>You are awarded points for eating mice and bonus points when you beat a level, given that the bonus timer has not run out yet. The faster you clear a level, the more bonus points you earn, which are multiplied by the level number. When Paulie runs out of lives, your game is over. If you got a high score, you can enter your name in the top five.</p>\n<p>The python can either be controlled by the arrow keys or by the mouse. For clearing a level of all mice, you either go to the next level in the given order or a random level is chosen, depending on the settings. It is also possible to freely choose a level. Furthermore, you can adjust the difficulty by selecting between five different levels of speed. The registered version of this shareware game features the ScreenSculptor, an editor which allows you to build your own levels.</p>",

The player controls a space ship which needs to kill all Zilog ships on the 8x8x8 game field. The game shows only one perspective at the time but by using one of the three scanners the perspective shifts and it also says how many enemy ships are on he chosen axis. </p>\n<p>Just like in <em>Battleship</em> he doesn't know where these ships exactly are. He has to aim his airship's gun to a certain coordinate - if he hits an enemy ship, it gets destroyed. The position also gets marked so he doesn't shoot the same field twice. The Zilog ships don't shoot back - the difficulty are the limited fuel and rocket reserves which are reduced with every movement respectively shot. There are overall three difficulty settings.</p>",

The pieces start in a puzzle box, and can be dragged out from there into the main window. If a piece is in the correct position, it will snap into place.

        "description": "<p><em>Brainiacs: 3-D Baffle and Hex</em> is a compilation of two puzzle games and is one of a series of Brainiacs 3-D titles.</p>\n<p>The first game here is <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=3-D+Pegged\">3-D Pegged</a>, formerly known as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=3-D+Baffle\">3-D Baffle</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Epic+Pegged\">Epic Pegged</a>. This game is an animated version of the board game commonly known as Solitaire in the UK, Peg Solitaire in the US, another common name is Brainvita. The game is played on a board with a number holes in it of pegs in it. The player must jump one peg over another to capture it, all captured pieces are removed and the object is to finish with a single peg in the central hole. \nThe standard game has all the holes, apart from the central hole, occupied by a peg. This is an animated version of that game with several non-standard peg configurations of escalating difficulty. It also has two choices of boards &amp; pegs, several types of music and a range of in-game sounds.</p>\n<p>The second game is <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=3-D+Hex\">3-D Hex</a> which is a two player strategy game played on a hexagonal grid. Each player takes it in turns to place a piece in a cell on the grid. The object is to link two sides before the other player does. The game can be played with two players or by one player against the computer.</p>",

The sliders to the left and to the bottom allow the player to look up, down, left and right; the slider to the right allows the player to move forward or backward along the direction the camera is pointing. </p>\n<p>Upon nearing the puzzle the game begins and the player is offered the first clues. Cell 1 is preselected for the player to enter a letter. None of the cells are numbered, however when selected a cell changes colour and any associated clues are displayed in a window in the lower right corner of the game area. Answers are entered letter by letter and to do this the player must select each cell individually, enter a letter, then select the next cell, enter the next letter and so on.</p>\n<p>The game has no help function and the player cannot progress to the second puzzle until the first has been correctly completed. The game is controlled with the mouse and the letters are entered via the keyboard.</p>\n<p>The game is also called <em>CyberSpace Cruiser</em> throughout the documentation, and it contains an offer to purchase \"virtual real estate in cyberspace\": by paying 40 dollars, a player could claim part of the game's virtual space for himself, which would then be marked with his name in all future releases of <em>CyberSpace Cruiser</em>. The player could then store up to 32 kilobytes of data in the owned part of cyberspace (upon logging in with a username and password), effectively functioning as an elaborate form of clipboard. According to the documentation, the program also contains network support: when installed on a network, multiple users can log in from their computers, see the other users moving around in cyberspace, and converse with them.</p>",

The mazes vary in complexity from the \"Maze of the Day\" to the \"Maze of the Year\" and while single screen mazes can be generated, most mazes are three dimensional.</p>\n<p>Three dimensional mazes are spread across a number of floors. The player starts in one room and must navigate the maze to reach a specific room which the game will identify. The game is mouse controlled and the player navigates the maze by moving around their current room and selecting an arrow. The arrow will take the player up or down to a room on another floor. To help the player the game keeps track of their progress and shows where they have been. The mazes the game can generate are;* Single Floor mazes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maze of the Day (easy) \u2013 restricted to 2, 3, or 4 floors these mazes change daily</li>\n<li>Maze of the Day \u2013 these span 4-6 floors and a new maze is presented each day.</li>\n<li>Maze of the Week \u2013 these span 7-9 floors and change every Sunday.

The player plays the game using a mouse to manipulate the three controls below the main window.   </p>\n<p>The first control is a pair of arrows, one pointing up and one pointing down. This controls the strength of the putt. The second control is a white circle in a grey square. The white circle represents the ball and, using the mouse, the player positions a green dot which marks the direction from which the club will strike the ball. With the force and direction of the shot determined the player uses the third control to initiate the shot. An animation in the main window shows the track of the ball.  </p>\n<p>Each player has a total of eight strokes with which to complete the hole after which control passes to the next player. Should the ball go into a bunker the ball is replaced at the start point.  </p>\n<p>The object of the game is to complete the course in as few shots as possible.</p>\n<p>Apart from the entry of the players names the game is entirely mouse controlled. It has an in-game help function, and a midi sound track and sound effects (both of which can be disabled) as well as a high score table.</p>\n<p>The shareware version of the game has five holes.

        "description": "<p><em>Masque Caribbean Stud Poker</em> is an officially licensed simulation of a casino card game for 1 - 4 players where either the computer or real people can take the role of players 2,3 &amp; 4. </p>\n<p>The game starts with each player placing a bet or \"Ante\" in the treasure chest lid area of the table. The cards are then dealt, all the player(s) cards are dealt face down but the top card of the dealers hand is placed face up. Each player in turn decides whether their hand will beat the dealers. If the player thinks there's a chance of beating the dealer they choose to bet on their hand which causes chips to the value of the original bet to be transferred from their stack to the table. If the player does not think they can beat the dealer then they fold and lose their original bet. The dealer then reveals their cards and players who have beaten the dealer are paid.   </p>\n<p>A feature of this version of poker is that the dealer must have an Ace and a King or better in their hand in order to qualify, if they do not have this minimum requirement in their hand then the dealer loses and anyone still in the game, regardless of what is in their hand, will win.   </p>\n<p>Winnings are based the strength of a players hand with two pairs paying out double the bet and four of a kind paying twenty times the bet. In addition there is a progressive bonus payout for hands that contain a flush or better.</p>\n<p>The game allows the player to change various settings such as the speed of the deal, the minimum &amp; maximum bet and to set automatic reminders for the progressive bet and other gaming situations. It also includes a CD player so that the player can listen to their own music during the game.</p>\n<p>The game can be played entirely with the mouse, bets being made by dragging &amp; dropping chips onto the table or by clicking on the stack. Alternatively the game can be played entirely via the keyboard or by a combination of the two.   </p>\n<p>There are no save game feature or network play features in this game.</p>",

The player controls a brick firing cannon. The falling shapes must be formed into solid rectangles by the addition of these bricks. </p>\n<p>This game is not about shooting blocks and blowing things up it's about strategically adding bricks to the shapes as they fall to form larger, rectangular shapes and thus generate more points. For example overlapping blocks can, if completed in the right order, be cleared as a single unit.</p>\n<p>Once a block has been completed it disappears and the player's score increases. If any block hits the ground it's game over.</p>",

The obvious goal is to earn money and in order to achieve this, the company has to take contracts through call for bids. It is both important to have a good bid (high enough to be profitable and low enough to get the job) and a high workload distribution which binds all resources of the company, i.e. staff and equipment. Expansion eventually leads into processing multiple contracts at once and entering the field of land speculation.</p>\n<p>Before starting a game, the player can choose the country in which the company is registered. This influences the running costs and the employees available for hire. People with low qualification are cheap but also influence the construction results negatively. The interface is completely based on menus in which the player analyzes the numbers and adjusts the setting screws of the business.</p>",

Your goal in each hand is to avoid winning any 'tricks' including a heart or the Black Maria (aka the Queen of Spades), or to gain all 13 hearts and the Black Maria. <em>Hearts for Windows</em> allows for 1 to 4 human players but is always a 4 player game either filled by human players or computer players. The only drawback to more than one person playing is all the human players cards are displayed on one screen, allowing for each player to see each others cards.

As with the classic <em>Space Invaders</em> game the player has a canon which they can move to the right and left along the base of the game window. The canon fires upwards at the descending alien ships. This game varies from the original game in a number of ways:* Here there are no buildings to hide behind.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In another variation from the original game the alien ships land and steal the planets resources, these ships must be destroyed once they take-off as if they reach the top of the screen the players score is reduced.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, the player must protect defending craft as they take-off. Shooting these down by mistake also reduces the player's score</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The game is entirely keyboard controlled.

Nanobots have been surgically implanted into the player's brain to repair damage caused by watching too much television. However as they went about their work the nanobots achieved intelligence of their own and in order to survive they are now feeding on the player's brain. The good news is that the player's imagination has created a ship that will destroy the nanobots and so the battle commences.</p>\n<p>There are nine scenarios in the full game with three being made available in the shareware release. This is a keyboard controlled game with the arrows moving the ship left / right and the space bar firing the ship's weapon. These is no up/down movement.\nOnce a wave of nanobots has been cleared the game displays the player's score before presenting the next wave which the game claims to configure by analysing the player's game style. Some nanobots leave a power crystal behind that, if captured, upgrades the players weapons.</p>\n<p>The game has sound, music, a high score table and re-definable keys.</p>",

Like its predecessor this is a keyboard controlled game with the arrows moving the ship left / right and the space bar firing the ship's weapon. These is no up/down movement.</p>\n<p>When a wave of nanobots has been cleared the game displays the player's score before presenting the next wave. Destroyed enemy ships leave behind power crystals which, if collected, can be used to buy power ups such as more effective weapons, shields and special features before the next wave commences. \nWith each successive level the enemy ships also evolve, getting power ups of their own making them harder to hit and giving them better weapons. The player starts with three lives, new lives are added for every 300,000 points scored. When a life is lost all the crystals that have been collected are lost.</p>\n<p>The full game has three scenarios, only one of which is available in the shareware release. Some weapons and features are also available only in the registered release.</p>",

This means dropping into sector after sector of space and destroying any ship that is present. The limitations are that the canon will overheat if overused and that each sector jump uses fuel which must be replenished by visiting a star base.</p>\n<p>In combat there is the tactical scanner which looks like a red radar screen. This gives an indication of the position and number of enemy ships and, when combined with target direction indicators in the targeting window, help the player blast the bad guys.</p>\n<p>The game is played out in the cockpit of the ship and is entirely mouse controlled. The mouse functions in two ways. In 'ship' mode moving the mouse steers the ship while the left mouse button fires the canon. The left mouse button toggles between this mode and 'cockpit' mode in which the player can select either the 'Eject' button to end the game or the 'NavTrack' screen in which the player selects the next sector to jump to.</p>",

The game is entirely mouse controlled. The ball is placed on the starting pad via the mouse.

The first four stacks are dealt face up, the remainder have three cards face down and four cards face up. Cards can be moved between the stacks either singly or on blocks, the only rule being that the card selected must be placed on a card of the opposite colour and one higher in rank - so a seven of hearts could be placed on the eight of spades for example. An empty stack can only be filled by moving a king into it.</p>\n<p>The object is to transfer all the cards to the foundations building from ace to the king, the author states that with practice this can be achieved in around one hand in three.</p>\n<p>The game has no undo feature, no hint feature, and is played entirely with the mouse</p>",

        "description": "<p>The game recreates the Battle of Gettysburg, the pivotal point of the American Civil War. Player takes a role of General Meade or General Lee as the supreme commander against a simulator that takes into account different variables that affect the outcome of a battle - terrain, morale, stamina, ammunition, aim, and more. Historical factors that hindered soldiers in the 1860s, such as poor communication or slow-moving artillery, are also reflected in play. </p>\n<p>66 brigades fought for the Union and 52 brigades fought for the Confederacy are present in the game. Player directs the marches, issue orders to cavalry, infantry, and artillery to engage the enemy, entrench in key positions, and bombard strongholds in the real time. Four playing speeds are offered. The speeds correspond to the number of seconds that the battle simulation uses to represent one minute of the actual Battle of Gettysburg. The game's objective is to see if the battle may be fought better than it was in the real life. If player takes the Confederate side, see if Lee can win. If player fights for the Union side, see if Meade can preserve more lives while still holding the position. The performance will be reviewed at the end.</p>",

In <em>Pac-Man</em> the player has to eat all the dots from the board in order to pass to the next level. In this game the dots are replaced by fruits (apple, strawberry and cherry) that the player has to eat in order to get a score and to go to the next level. The enemies are four mean laser machines in the sides of the levels and they attack the player by shooting lasers. When the character is hit, a life is lost. Unlike <em>Pac-Man</em> there are no special pills in the game. The board also contains skulls and they also make the character lose a life upon contact. After every level a password is provided to continue playing from that level immediately.</p>",

The game is reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pipe+Dream\">Pipe Mania!</a> in that the player has to guide a spark along electrical wires from a start point to an end point. However In this game the player does not add new pieces of wiring to the puzzle, instead the wiring is already in place and the player rotates it at the node points to make new connections or to break others.</p>\n<p>Additionally there are special nodes, some of which speed up the spark, some which cause it to burn the wires it passes through so they cannot be re-used and some fixed nodes that cannot be rotated at all.</p>\n<p>All puzzles are timed. The game has a high score table which holds the ten best scores. The game is played entirely via the mouse.</p>",

All blocks are the same shape but the coloured squares they contain will vary. The player can position the blocks with the left/right keys, rotate the coloured squares within the block with the up key, and drop the block with the down key. The object is to align the colours so that three or more in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line are all of the same colour, when this happens they flash and disappear causing the squares above to drop down. The process repeats until either the player gets bored or the screen fills up.</p>",

The rules are quite simple, a piece may move to any legal square, provided the path to that square is not blocked. Once it arrives in the target square the piece must fire an arrow one or two squares in any legal direction. The square where the arrow lands is then claimed by that player and locked. Once a square is locked neither player nor their arrows can travel over it.<br>\nPlayers take turns to move their pieces and the game ends when one player is unable to move and the player holding the most territory wins.</p>\n<p>The game is entirely mouse controlled and the computer opponent has three skill settings, there is also an undo feature and a save/load game feature.</p>\n<p>Though this is a complete game that was released as freeware there is/was a registered version with more features that could be purchased, furthermore for a small fee players could receive game updates as and when they became available.</p>",

The game starts with the four aces being arranged in the centre of the game area, the remaining forty-eight cards are made into eight groups of six cards and are placed with one group on either side of each of the four aces. All cards are placed face up, overlapped and exposed within groups. Cards are moved one at a time. Any card can be moved onto the pile in the centre as long as it is of the same suit as the original ace and it follows in sequence. Likewise any card can be moved onto another row if, regardless of suit, the card it is moved onto is one higher in sequence - so a ten can be moved onto a jack and later a nine can be moved onto the ten etc.</p>\n<p>The game contains two variations. In <em>Street and Alley</em> the aces are not placed in the centre when the game starts. The player deals the full deck in four rows of seven and four rows of six and an ace is only moved to the centre as it is released. The other variation is <em>Citadel</em>, here the aces are shuffled into the body of the deck but as they are encountered in the deal they are placed in the centre as are any subsequent cards that can be placed on them. So in this variation if the Ace of Hearts was discovered early on in the deal then when the Two of Hearts is dealt it would be placed on the ace immediately followed, if possible, by the Three and Four etc should they be discovered in sequence.</p>\n<p>The game has save/load and undo/redo functions but has no sound and no statistics are kept. It is played entirely with the mouse</p>",

The game starts with twelve cards being place face up in two rows of six. The player works through the deck of cards moving aces onto the foundation cells as they become available. The twelve cards that are placed face up are used as bases onto which other cards can be moved if they are of the same suit and one lower in rank.</p>\n<p>In the standard game the player can only play through the stockpile of cards once and once a card is moved to the foundation pile it stays there. However there are two variations available to the player via the menu bar, one allows them to re-use the stock pile and the other allows cards to be brought back from the foundation into the build area.</p>\n<p>The player scores two points for cards moved to the foundation but loses one point for each card turned over from the stock pile and ten points for reusing the deck should that option be enabled.</p>\n<p>The game has save/load and undo/redo functions but has no sound and no statistics are kept.

Twenty cards are dealt face up in four rows of five cards, the remaining thirty-two cards are held in the stockpile and the object of the game is to clear this pile. Cards are removed from the twenty made available if the deal by matching adjacent pairs (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) of the same rank. When all pairs have been matched and removed the spaces are filled in by closing up the remaining cards and then dealing cards from the stock pile.</p>\n<p>The game has a couple of variations which are accessed via the menu bar. One option is to match pairs which match on both rank and colour, in this variant the cards do not have to be adjacent and the second option changes the way the spaces are filled from the stock pile.</p>\n<p>The player scores one point for cards moved to the foundation but scoring stops as soon as the player uses the Undo or Load a saved game options.</p>\n<p>The game has save/load and undo/redo functions but has no sound and no statistics are kept.

Across the top of the screen are the eight foundation cells where the aces are placed and the sequences are built. Cards can be moved from the build area to the foundation if they follow both in suit and in ascending sequence. Cards may be moved between rows if they follow in suit and descending sequence. Cards taken from the stockpile can be added to the foundation or any of the rows provided they follow the same rules otherwise they are placed on a discard pile.</p>\n<p>The game has two variations which can be enabled via a menu bar option which makes the game easier to complete. The first allows cards to be moved from the foundation sequences back into the build area which gives the player more options when trying to complete and join sequences. The standard game does not allow a redeal, the second variation allows one redeal of the discard pile.</p>\n<p>The player scores two point for cards moved to the foundation but loses one for each card turned over. Ten points are lost should the waste pile be redealt, all scoring stops as soon as the player uses the Undo or Load a saved game options. </p>\n<p>The game has save/load and undo/redo functions but has no sound and no statistics are kept. It is played entirely with the mouse</p>",

The lower part is a wide low picture wall, there are six to choose from, and the upper part is used by two flying 'brickbats' one good and one bad.\nWhen the game starts the image in the lower part of the screen is converted to blocks and scrambled. Using the arrow keys and the spacebar the player manoeuvres the good brickbat to pick up blocks and drop them into position to reassemble the original image. While they are doing this the bad brickbat is also moving blocks around randomly as well as trying to kill the player's good brickbat by dropping blocks on them, who can do the same to him which makes him disappear for a short while.</p>\n<p>The game is entirely keyboard controlled and it records the top one hundred best completion times.</p>",

It is a trick-taking card game for two to six people which originated in Ireland and is said to be well known in Eastern Canada. This computerised version of the game is played by one player against the computer and is based on rules common in the Merrimack Valley area of Massachusetts and its surrounding area.</p>\n<p>Briefly the object of the game is to score one hundred and twenty points, the first player to reach this number wins the game. In each hand the players are dealt five cards, each player then takes it in turn to bid for trumps. The highest bidder wins and names trumps, they also get the opportunity to discard weak cards from their hand and replace them with cards from the kitty. Both players also get to discard unwanted cards and draw unseen replacements from the deck. Players then play cards and attempt to win as many tricks as possible.</p>\n<p>This game has a comprehensive help file explaining the rules, scoring and principles of the game, it also has an optional tutor mode which the player can use while playing a game to aid them in their play.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Banania</em>, the player takes the role of Berti who works as a garbageman in a warehouse with 51 floors. Unfortunately an escaped monkey fled into the warehouse and left a lot of banana peels behind. Now Berti's job is to move through all floors and clean up.</p>\n<p>To reach all banana peels, Berti has to solve <em>Sobo-Ban</em>-style puzzles: shoving around boxes to create new ways. Boxes can't be pulled, so it is important to think ahead in order to avoid unsolvable situations. There are two kinds of boxes: one which need a free place behind them and others which allow to push all other boxes (including the first kind) behind them at once. Other obstacles are doors (require finding a key) and two monster types which kill Berti on touch: dumb ones which can be trapped with boxes and smart ones which can push boxes themselves. </p>\n<p>Berti has unlimited lives and the current level can be instantly reset. There are two movement options available (either Berti moves automatically in the pushed direction until he reaches a wall or the stopping button is pressed or the player has to press the movement button for each step) and the game counts the used steps for use on the high-score list.</p>",

The player has the choice between three factions (USA/Britain, Soviet Union and Germany/Italy) with the goal of winning the war. The presentation is similar to other wargames: abstract symbols are moved over hexagonal fields.</p>\n<p>This game focuses on macro-management: The playing field (Europe, Northern Africa and a small part of the USA) is one big map divided in relatively few hex fields (e.g. Germany has five). During each round, the player produces units (restricted by force pools which ensure that each faction keeps a certain ratio of unit types) and moves units. Combat is decided with a dice roll while factors like seasons influence the winning chances. Producing units and offensive actions require building and military points which are awarded at the end of each round, e.g. by holding cities. It is important to keep supply lines.</p>\n<p>This is an updated version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=The+Big+Three\">The Big Three</a> specifically developed for Windows 3.x. Besides VGA graphics and adapted menus, the main addition is an AI opponent to play against.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mind Grind</em> is a one or two player quiz game.</p>\n<p>The player selects a character from one of several that are supplied, most are aliens, and competes over five rounds:* The Matrix of Knowledge: This takes place on an 8x8 grid and to advance to the next level the player must connecting four cells in any direction: horizontally, vertically or diagonally by correctly answering the question that they contain.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Pillars of Wisdom: Here the player must advance to the topmost level of pillars and they may jump one or two ranks at a time. The difficulty of the question is determined by the level of the jump attempted.</li>\n<li>The Maze of the Mind: Is a randomly generated labyrinth containing forty-five 45 locked doors. The player must navigate their way out of the maze by answering questions to open these doors. Question difficulty will increase as competitors progress further into the maze</li>\n<li>Platforms of Insight: The player(s) stand in a tube. Beneath them are stacked platforms containing question topics. Answering a question correctly removes a platform while answering one incorrectly adds a platform. Too many wrong answers will see the player crushed against the top of the tube.</li>\n<li>Looking For Signs Of intelligent Life: This is the final level and it sees the player piloting a space ship towards earth. To reach their destination the player must dock with ten space stations and answer the questions they ask correctly. Getting a question wrong means being flung into hyperspace.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In both one and two player games there are bonus points for being the first to complete a stage and options to spend some points/dollars, for example in the final level there are meteors and such to be avoided along the way so spending points to buy a deflector shield may be a worthwhile investment</p>",

Players take turns to move a token either one or two fields (diagonal moves are allowed); if the piece is moved on a field which borders on the original field, a duplicate piece is created. <br>\nWhen one or multiple of the opponent's pieces adjoin the new position, they are converted to the player's colour. Moving is mandatory (unless there is no legal move possible) and the match is over as soon as all fields are filled up. The winner is the player who has more pieces on the board at this point. <br>\nSome fields on the board may be blocked off, these appear as a solid black cell in the grid, and a single player can compete against AI opponents of varying difficulty.</p>\n<p>The game is played entirely with the mouse, it keeps score of the games in a session but has no high score table.

The people of your world are under one ruler. YOU The Emperor! Now your scientists have given you spaceflight. Your armies are training for planetary invasions! An entire galaxy awaits your rule!

All of which neatly sets the tone for this strategy / resource management game.</p>\n<p>The player takes control of a small fleet around a single star in a big galaxy. The object of the game is to build more and bigger fleets, strategize, and conquer it all. Planets can be tasked to produce ships, troops and planetary defences. Fleets can be ordered to attack nearby systems and once the opposition is defeated in space transports can be sent to conquer the planets.<br>\nIn game time is based on a stardate system which can be frozen or sped up as required. This enables the player to send fleets across large distances, or construct capital ships quickly in real time.</p>",

Unlike <em>Space Invaders</em> however the player has no buildings to hide behind and they are not limited to just left and right movement.</p>\n<p>The player has three lives and the object is to score as highly as possible.

The player moves around the 'top' of this well zapping the creatures as they climb. Once they reach the top of the well it's just a matter of time before they catch the player who then loses one of their three lives. The registered version of the game grants smart bombs after level fourteen.</p>\n<p>The two player game is a 'hot seat' game with players taking turns at the keyboard, they do not necessarily play on the same wire frame. The game has sound and a high score card, the action keys cannot be redefined.</p>",

Games can be saved and loaded at any time. </p>\n<p>Some unusual options let you change the magnetism of the balls, the tilt of the table (making balls drifting downwards) and even the gravity (pick between the Earth, the Moon, Jupiter or Planet X - a strong gravity planet in a worm hole).</p>\n<p>The help file provided with the game also includes a history of pool games and game techniques.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Cheese Terminator</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Sokoban\">Sokoban</a> clone, a top-down puzzle game where the player, controlling a mouse, must push all the pieces of cheese onto target squares, and only one piece of cheese can be pushed at a time. The game contains 50 levels. It's possible to choose to play any level with the \"Practice Level\" option. By choosing \"New Game\" from the menu, the player begins a scored game, starting from level 1 and advancing to the next level when the last one is completed. While in this game mode, the player can restart the current level at the cost of one life; running out of lives ends the game, and allows the player to enter his name into the high score table, recording the level he reached and the total number of moves he made. </p>\n<p>Other features include undoing the player's last move by pressing Backspace, and a \"boss key\" (F10) which immediately minimizes the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Air Strike</em> is a single player, mouse controlled shooter.</p>\n<p>The shareware version of the game contains Episode One: Air Attack. This is a simple ten level game in which the mouse cursor becomes a targeting reticule for an anti aircraft gun. Enemy aircraft of various sizes appear, some fly towards the player towards the player, some fly across the screen at an angle, others fly away from the player off into the distance. <br>\nUsing their mouse/gun and limited ammunition the player must shoot these planes down, each plane scores points with the smaller planes scoring more because they are harder to hit.<br>\nLater the action moves to the coast where the enemy are more cautions and harder to hit. Finally, just to make things even harder the player has to fend off attacks at night.</p>\n<p>The registered version contains two further episodes. In Episode Two: The Pillbox the player controls a gun emplacement and must defend their position against tanks and/or storm troopers etc. In Episode Three: Sub Hunt the action moves out to sea with the player commanding a destroyer and fighting U-Boats</p>",

The purpose of this add-on is to provide the player/pilot with accurate approach plates to any airfield, over seventeen hundred that are supplied and the player can use this product to create their own.</p>\n<p>The player starts by opening the flight simulator and lining up their aircraft for a landing, at this point they save their flight as a new Flight Simulator Situation file. Then in Final Approach they select the airfield of their choice , together with the position of their plane (latitude, longitude and altitude), the program then calculates the headings and descent rate the layer must follow to land the plane. These details are then saved, replacing the new situation file the player created in step one so that when the player next accesses that file from within the flight simulator they find themselves about to land at their designated airfield</p>\n<p>Naturally there's more to <em>Final Approach</em> than just this, approach plans can be created, edited or deleted; new navigation points can be added; they can be printed, saved and shared. While data can be imported into <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> the printed plans can also be used with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/2805/flight-assignment-airline-transport-pilot/\">subLOGIC's ATP</a> and A320.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Boulderland</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Boulder+Dash\">Boulder Dash</a> clone. It supports keyboard and joystick controls. There is an in-built editor, and a \"replay\" feature. Twenty standard levels are included, but there is support for up to 999.</p>\n<p>The main gameplay involves collecting a certain number of giant red gems and then, when the right number has been collected, heading to the exit to complete the level and move on to the next one, all within the time limit. You use the cursor keys or the joystick to move, but if you move while holding down the left shift key (or the joystick button), you can affect the tile in that direction actually moving into that position. The main complication is boulders: when each level starts the boulders are supported by the ground underneath them, but as you dig through the level to get to the gems, eventually you will need to dig directly underneath a boulder, leaving an empty space underneath it. Since it is no longer supported by anything, it will start to fall. If a falling boulder lands on you, you lose a life. You can push a boulder left or right, but only if there is an empty space on the other side, and only if it is not currently falling.</p>\n<p>Then there are other game mechanics familiar to those who have played other versions and variants of Boulder Dash: monsters that move around inside empty space, and explode if you touch them, or a boulder falls on them; a self-replicating amoeba that expands until it is completely trapped, then transforms into gems; a type of magical wall that transforms falling boulders into gems, if there is empty space underneath it; a wall with a gap that closes up as you dig through it; and so on.</p>\n<p><em>Boulderland</em> also adds some new mechanics of its own, such as bubbles that you can burst (using numeric keys 4/8/6/2 for left/up/right/down) and bombs that you can collect then deploy (also using the numeric keys).</p>",

In the center of the labyrinth is a zone where several monsters live. You cannot enter the monster zone, but the monsters can leave it, and chase you around the labyrinth. If they catch you, you will lose a life. If you lose all your lives, the game is over. As well as the smaller yellow pellets, there are a few big pellets that allow you to temporarily eat the monsters. The monsters are normally a color, like blue or cyan, but while you can eat them they all change to white. When you collect all the pellets in the labyrinth, you start a new level.</p>\n<p>The game attempts to automatically detect the best speed to run at as it starts up.

        "description": "<p><em>Animation Hangman</em> is a variant of the word guessing pen and paper game where short video clips of 3D animations act as clues. Other than that it works like any other Hangman game with the player being presented with a hidden word that have to be guessed by entering letters one at a time. Correct guesses lead to the letters being filled in while incorrect guesses lead to a stick figure being drawn. After six wrong guesses the man is hanged. </p>\n<p>In addition to the standard Hangman game, there is an additional game mode called Multiple Puzzle Hangman. It works the same but the player automatically moves on to a new puzzle when one is completed. The hangman is not erased between puzzles so all the wrong guesses gets carried over. The aim is to get a high score by completing as many puzzles as possible.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>RoboQuest</em> is a mix of simple robot construction and a 3D shooter, aimed at children. The premise is that an evil witch who fails at magically creating a child of her own, has sent some of her minions to kidnap some children. She now keeps them imprisoned in her castle. The witch is also seen magically breaking up the protagonist's robot in the introduction scene, just because she can.</p>\n<p>The game has two parts, first a time-limited 3D construction section, where the player has to rebuild the broken robot, selecting one from three simple pre-made plans (good/better/best) for use in the second part of the game. One of three difficulty levels is selected when entering the castle with the completed robot.</p>\n<p>The witch's castle, made with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=DOOM\">DOOM</a>-style graphics, has a five-level 3D maze in which the robot needs to navigate, find weapons, repair toolboxes/parts, locate healing power-ups, and find more fuel, keys for secret doors, spells to use against the witch and weapons to disable guards. There are ghosts or insects blocking the way. The character eventually needs to reach and defeat the witch to rescue the children.</p>\n<p>The player can use a 1st-person view from a small monitor screen inside the robot, with status indicators surrounding it, or a 3rd-person fullscreen view, in the castle maze. Level transitions are a mix of pre-rendered 3D sequences in high resolution with enemies overlaid as 2D cartoon sprites.</p>",

The player uses the mouse to place tokens around the sides of the grid, these tokens are effectively light sources and they shine a beam along this respective columns/rows. When these beams of light pass near a hidden gem they are deflected or absorbed and using this information thus provided the player must deduce the location of the gemstones.</p>\n<p>There are five grid sizes, 6x6, 7x7, 8x8, 9x9 &amp; 10x10 , the bigger the grid the more gems there are to find, and four window sizes which are independent of the grid size. The base game has a human player looking for gems that the computer has hidden, but there's also a 'Human Hides Gems' option where the player places the gems for a friend to find.</p>",

Each cell has numbers in it and players take turns selecting cells and adding the number from that cell to their score. At the end of the game the player with the highest score wins. The game decides the starting point and the first player selects their chosen cell from the same row, the next player selects their cell from the same column as the cell selected by the previous player. The game continues with players taking turns selecting numbers from rows and then columns until all cells are used or there is no onward move from the last cell selected.</p>\n<p>With a classic game like this there are often additions or improvements with each incarnation, here the difference between this game and the original is the inclusion of an 'Advanced' level of difficulty.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Nine Men's Morris</em>, also known as '<em>Mill</em>' is a player vs computer, mouse controlled, implementation of a strategy board game that the author claims dates back over three thousand years!</p>\n<p>This is a three phase, turn based game played on a board with concentric squares marked on it. These are connected by lines. The object of the game is to form a line of three pieces. This is called a 'mill'. Doing so costs the opposing player one piece.  </p>\n<p>Phase one sees the players putting their pieces onto the board looking for a strategic advantage, trying to form a mill or positioning their pieces so that their opponent cannot form a mill. Phase two has the players taking turns to move their pieces around the board, according to a set of rules, looking to form a mill.  </p>\n<p>The game ends when one player has only two pieces left - obviously they cannot form a mill so for them it's over - or when a player has no valid moves to make.</p>\n<p>This implementation has options for player vs computer as either black or white, human vs human, computer vs computer, and the player can adjust the computer's thinking time for a harder or an easier game. In addition the author has added a few restrictions of their own, declaring the game is a draw when either player has made two hundred moves or when fifty moves have taken place and no piece has been captured. A draw will also be declared if the positions of the pieces on the board are repeated three times with the same player to move, in other words the game detects a stalemate and ends the match.</p>",

The players start with a base in the game area and take turns to put aliens / tokens onto the game board. A token can only be placed adjacent to a player's existing token, diagonals count as being adjacent, so there's a period of expansion until the player's tokens meet. when they do meet up however a player can capture another player's token by putting three of their own tokens around it, the captured piece changes colour and this may lead to further pieces being captured.</p>\n<p>The shareware version comes with three game areas, called galaxies in the game, while the registered version has a larger play area, more galaxies and a level designer.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Rollem</em> is a one or two person, turn based, shareware, strategy game based on the ides of rolling marbles to score points.</p>\n<p>After deciding who goes first the game area is revealed, it's a grid that's populated with numbered cells, arrows and obstacles with a row of marbles across the top. If a falling marble lands on an arrow it rolls left/right depending on which direction the arrow is pointing and causes the arrow to switch direction, if it hits an obstacle it stops. Points are scored depending on how far down the screen the marble rolls, reaching the bottom of the screen scores one hundred points and rolling over a numbered score adds that amount to the distance score.</p>\n<p>Each player has twenty marbles. When all have been played the second phase of the game begins, here the game removes obstacles and any marbles that are thus free to fall will do so adding to a player's score, this makes it worth taking a low score in the first phase if, by doing so, high points cam be scored in the second phase.</p>\n<p>The game has three levels of difficulty, a high score table, sounds and long/short modes of play. It can be played by two people or as a one player game against the computer.</p>",

Then some alien traders pass by and, for a hefty fee, they pass on the secret of the gravimetric drive, this allows you to travel from one star to another using areas of space where gravity is weakened by the star's gravity. Now you can explore space beyond your home system, however the traders made the same deal with all other species in your galaxy prompting a race for habitable systems with a jump point. This leads to local disputes and eventually to war as the only way to be guaranteed that you'll be left in peace is to be the last race standing.</p>\n<p>The player starts the game with a single star and expands their galaxy by exploring the stars, colonizing unoccupied stars and building fleets and garrisons to protect them. When occupied systems are encountered there's the chance to fight or retreat.</p>\n<p>The game area is randomly generated when the game starts, among the many game configuration options is one that sets the size of the galaxy thus making for a short, medium or long game and the tactics of the AI players can be defined to make the game tougher or easier. The game has a lengthy tutorial which takes the player through around a dozen moves of a game against three AI opponents.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>WinWar II</em> is a shareware, strategy game based on World War II that can be played over a local network by sharing a common network file among the players.</p>\n<p>In this game the player(s) take the part of the seven major participants of the war USA, UK, France, Russia for the Allies and Germany, Italy and Japan for the Axis powers. The objective is for either side to capture three capital cities from their opponents. Unusually, at least in the early stages, the USA is one of the weaker countries producing less armaments per turn than the Axis forces reflecting the fact that they were not prepared for the war.\nIn each turn players have so many points to use, these can be spent improving their production capacity, improving their level of technology, building ships, factories, planes, troops etc. or moving their forces around and engaging in warfare. In the standard game only friendly forces are visible but there is an option to make all forces visible.</p>\n<p>The game map is scrollable and covers the whole world so, for example, forces can be moved off the eastern side of the map to attack the enemy on the west.</p>",

On the board there are penalty/bonus squares such as \u2018Back Four Spaces\u2019; Roll Again\u2019; Miss A Turn\u2019 and so on.</p>\n<p>The game is mouse controlled, one unusual feature is the \u2018Scale\u2019 option that\u2019s tucked away in a drop down menu. The game board is too big to fit onto the screen and still remain readable so the default view shows only a quarter of the board in a scrollable window, the \u2018Scale\u2019 option shows the whole screen.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Glass Bead Challenge</em> is a shareware strategy game for two players, one player vs the computer, or computer vs computer, it is entirely mouse controlled.</p>\n<p>The game is played on a grid, not of lines but of spots. There are different grid sizes available ranging from 5x5 to 10x10. Glass beads are the tokens used in this game, hence its name, and when one is placed on a point it occupies that spot and, for now at least, owns the surrounding spots which change colour accordingly. When the next player takes their turn they cannot play on an occupy, however by playing on a nearby unoccupied spot they stake an equal claim to the owned spots which then change colour to neutral. This continues throughout the game with the owned spots switching from one colour to the other depending on which player occupies the most adjacent spots. The game ends when there are no more spots or valid moves to be made</p>\n<p>In the shareware game the player can only play against the computer in \u2018Novice\u2019 mode, the registered version has both an Advanced computer opponent and an Expert opponent.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>3001: A Reading &amp; Math Odyssey</em> is an educational game that teaches mathematics and Greek mythology. The player comes from the planet Zarpharon which is about to be destroyed due to ecological disaster. To save the planet, the four parts of the Gratia machine, a device that keeps the environment in balance, has to be retrieved. The machine parts are hidden in ancient Greece and the player is sent back through time and space to find them. A mega-crystal is also needed and therefore the player has to find the identity of the council member that has stolen it.</p>\n<p>The game is played on a map of ancient Greece. By clicking on certain locations the player is able to interact with gods and heroes of the myths. When starting out the player is given a clue and to progress the player has to trade with the characters. This is done by giving gold, nectar or an item and in return other item or clues. Ultimately the player will be given the pieces of the machine. The player has a strength and a courage rating. The strength decreases when visiting a character that hasn't been referred in a clue and the game is lost when it reaches zero.</p>\n<p>To replenish nectar, gold and strength the player can visit the Oracle or the Library at Alexandria. At the oracle there are two types of questions that can be answered: a music question that gives strength and an anagram that gives a clue. It is also possible to get gold and nectar but these options are completely chance based. At the library the player can choose from four scrolls of knowledge. Each scroll contains four math problems and by completing these the player is awarded with new resources. There are also random interludes where the player encounters various mythological creatures. In each encounter the player has four choices: fight, talk, mutate or run. Each choice has a different consequence related to it.</p>",

The player selects any series of numbers from one to eighty simply by clicking on the numbered cells on the board, then they click on \u2018Start Game\u2019 and off it goes. The game draws twenty numbers which are shown across the top of the grid and by the changing colours of the squares on the board and sometimes, very rarely, the player wins \u2013 just like in a real casino.</p>\n<p>The game also has sound, a save/load option, variable game speed, an option for the computer to pick random numbers and a \u2018Multi Game\u2019 option where the computer will play up to five thousand games consecutively. The game optionally collects game statistics in a .txt file and has a function which displays machine resource usage in the menu bar.</p>",

When a player owns a full set of properties they can enhance them, thus costing other player(s) more when they land on them. There\u2019s also a casino square when the player lands here they can play blackjack and try to win some extra cash, the 'Free Parking' square now triggers a shareware reminder and the 'Jail' square is now a Vacation square, there are humorous versions of the 'Chance' squares too.</p>\n<p>The game has sound, three settings for the AI player\u2019s style of play, and can be played in English or German.</p>",

Both versions have functions that let the player add words to the game\u2019s dictionary either in-game or via a menu drop down box.</p>\n<p>The object of the game is to be the first player to construct eight words of three or more.\nThe game starts with half a dozen or so letters being made available from \u2018the pot\u2019. Players then take turns to draw a letter and try to make a word from those available, the letter they acquired at the start of their turn does not have to be part of this word. Words can be formed either wholly from the letters available or by modifying one of the player\u2019s or their opponent\u2019s words. However when modifying a word the player must create a word with a new \u2018root\u2019, so changing \u2018bring\u2019 into \u2018bringing\u2019 is not allowed but the word \u2018upbringing\u2019 is allowed.</p>\n<p>In addition to the game there is an option to find anagrams from a given set of letters but this only finds single words and then only if they are in the game\u2019s dictionary.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Solitaire King: Clock Solitaire</em> is a freeware, mouse controlled, single player card game, it can be played in a window or in full screen mode.</p>\n<p>This title was of a number of freeware games that the developer released to promote interest in the full product <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Solitaire+King\">Solitaire King</a> which had thirty-one different games and over eighty variations thereof.</p>\n<p>The game is played with a standard deck of fifty-two cards which are dealt into thirteen piles of four, twelve piles form a circle in the manner of a clock and one pile is in the centre. The game starts by turning over the top card of the centre pile, the number of the card turned over indicates the next pile the player goes to. For example if the card turned over is a three the player puts that card beside the pile that corresponds to the position the number three would occupy on a clock and turns over the top card of that pile which leads to another number and so on. Any jacks that are turned over are moved to the number eleven pile, queens are moved to the number twelve pile and kings are moved to the centre</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is to finish turn have all four kings turned face up in the centre, it does not matter whether all the other cards are turned over or not.</p>\n<p>The game has save/load and undo/redo functions but has no sound and no statistics are kept. It is played entirely with the mouse</p>",

The objective in this game is to score as many point as possible which is done by guessing words and the theme to each puzzle. The game is mouse controlled but players 'buzz in' via the keyboard - each player has their own assigned key</p>\n<p>The game area is divided into three main areas, the largest area is the crossword which is always set in a 12x12 grid. Beneath the crossword is an empty <em>Wheel of Fortune</em> style phrase waiting to be completed and to the left of the crossword is the hint window and a button that brings up the next clue.</p>\n<p>The game is played in three phases. The player(s) click on the hint button to reveal the next clue, these are almost always short and cryptic and they are displayed above a row of yellow boxes that corresponds to the length of the word the clue refers to. When they have had time to think about the answer the player(s) start the clock and after a \u2018Ready\u2019 \u2018Set\u2019 \u2018Go\u2019 the game starts putting random letters into the yellow boxes. When a player thinks they know the word they press their key, this stops the clock and brings up a small window into which they type their guess. If they are incorrect they lose points but if they are correct they gain points and also gain control of the crossword. Whether they are correct or not the letters from the correct answer are used to fill in some of the blanks in the crossword and/or the phrase beneath it.</p>\n<p>When a player has solved a clue correctly they have the option of guessing either a word in the crossword, which they can do as often as they like until they make a mistake or run out of words to complete, or they can attempt to guess the mystery phrase. Every correct word scores points and every incorrect guess loses the player points, guessing the phrase scores points and ends the game.</p>\n<p>The shareware version of the game has nine puzzles, the registered version has over forty plus a \u2018Puzzle Builder\u2019 and a \u2018Clue Builder\u2019</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Double Deck Solitaire</em> is a shareware game and, as the name suggests, is a card game for one player that uses two standard decks of cards, that\u2019s one hundred and four cards \u2013 no jokers.</p>\n<p>The Deal: The cards are shuffled and dealt into thirteen piles corresponding to the thirteen numbers in a suit With Ace being one and thirteen being the king. During the deal whenever an Ace or a King is dealt to a pile an additional card is added, face down, to the draw pile, also when the rank of the card matches the pile number \u2013 say a four is deal t to the fourth pile or a King to the last pile \u2013 then two additional cards are dealt face down, to the draw pile. All the cards are dealt face down and when the deal is complete the top card is turned over.</p>\n<p>The object of the game is to move all cards to their respective foundations and thus clear all piles.</p>\n<p>Playing the game: Whenever an Ace is on the top of a pile it is moved to the right of the thirteen piles until there is one ace of each suit over there. Cards are played onto the Ace foundations in ascending sequence by suit. Similarly Kings are moved to the left of the thirteen draw piles until there is one king of each suit present, cards are added to the King foundations in descending order.\nWhen the player has evaluated the initial turnover of cards moving Aces Kings and any other cards that follow in sequence to the foundations, they turn over a card from the draw pile. The rank of that card corresponds to one of the thirteen piles and that pile together with the card from the draw pile are placed face up in front of the player who moves as many cards to the foundations as possible. When there are no more moves to make the remaining cards ate returned to the field of thirteen piles and another card is taken from the draw pile. This continued until the last card from the draw pile has been played and there are no more moves to make.</p>\n<p>The game is entirely mouse controlled and cards that are clicked on are automatically moved to the foundations unless there is a choice to be made. It plays in a fixed size window, has a one move undo function, game statistics, two difficulty settings, multiple card backs, and sound</p>",

There are three levels of difficulty, options to set up a board to a part game position, save/load functions and \u2018blindfold\u2019 options where the black or white pieces are hidden. What is unusual about this game is the Draughts Tutorial which featured three openings, a dozen mid-game plays and four end of game plays, there's also a 'record' function for creating more set plays.

The four corners are the foundations upon which all other cards of the same suit are played in an ascending sequence, the deal is completed by playing a card into the top left corner thus giving the game its first foundation card and setting the rank of the remaining foundations.

The remaining seventeen cards form the draw pile and are placed face down and are turned over one at a time. Any available card from the seven stacks that is either one above or one below the card that\u2019s just been turned over is removed and placed on top of the turned card replacing it. The process is repeated as often as possible until there are no more moves to be made, then the next card is turned over and so on. This continues until either all cards on the table have been removed or all the cards from the draw pile have been exhausted. When moving cards to the draw pile the Ace counts as a low card and can only be played on, or after a two likewise the king is a high card and can only be played on, or after a queen.</p>\n<p>The game has save/load and undo/redo functions but has no sound and no statistics are kept.

As usual the player competes against three AI opponents in the standard game though, unusually, there is an option to compete against another program.</p>\n<p>The standard game will be familiar to anyone who has played the game that comes free with Windows, all cards are dealt out, three cards are passed to an opponent and the object of the game is to avoid winning a trick containing a heart or the queen of spades. Many optional rule variations are catered for in this game some of which are listed below:* Jack of Diamonds: this card can be worth minus ten points</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Exact Points: the game ends on a specified number of points, the default is one hundred, if a player\u2019s score is exactly the game ending number their score is reset to zero</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Shooting the Moon: this is a common variation in which the scores can be changed if a player wins all the penalty cards in one round. In some implementations the player can either reset their score to zero or double their opponent\u2019s scores, in this game the player\u2019s score is reduced by twenty six.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Queen of Spades: if this rule is enabled the player must dispose of their Queen of Spades, the highest penalty card, at the earliest opportunity</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Game Limit: The default game limit is one hundred points but this game allows the end score to be changed by the player</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

The remainder of the deck forms the draw pile and these are turned over one at a time. Aces when encountered are moved to one of the four foundations and the remainder of the cards follow as they become available in ascending sequence within the same suit. Other cards are played onto the seven piles in descending sequence red on black / black on red. Whenever a column becomes empty only a king, and the sequence of cards below it, can be moved into the gap.</p>\n<p>In the default game where cards from the draw pile are turned over one at a time the player only gets one pass at the draw pile, when it is exhausted the game is over. There are other game variations:* One variation turns over cards from the draw pile three at a time \u2013 in this variation the player can have as many passes through the draw pile as they want.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Another variation allows cards to be played from the foundations back onto one of the columns.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally there\u2019s the \u2018Thumb and Pouch\u2019 variation which allows any card to be played into an empty column and instead of alternating red/black/red in the columns any colour can be played on any other provided the suit is different.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The aim of the game in all its variations is to have all cards moved to the foundations starting with the ace and ending with the king</p>\n<p>The game has save/load and undo/redo functions but has no sound and no statistics are kept.

        "description": "<p><em>Shift Zone</em> is a single-player, mouse controlled puzzle game.</p>\n<p>In this game the player is presented with a series of levels, each level consisting of twelve puzzles which must all be solved before the player can progress. All puzzles are of the same type and require a logical approach. Each puzzle consists of a series of touching coloured rectangles, each rectangle has a number, from one to six, associated with it and that determines the colour. Clicking on any shape reduces it\u2019s numbered state, and the state of all touching shapes, by one until eventually it becomes a \u2018Shift Zone\u2019. </p>\n<p>The object of the game is to change the state of every rectangle into a \u2018Shift Zone\u2019 but there\u2019s a catch, \u2018Shift Zones\u2019 are unstable and will explode and end the game if changed so:* Once a rectangle has achieves \u2018Shift Zone\u2019 status it cannot be clicked on again or the puzzle is over and the player has to start again.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clicking on a shape connected to a \u2018Shift Zone\u2019 would result in an attempt to reduce the state of the \u2018Shift Zone\u2019 by one which would cause it to explode and the player has to start again.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once a puzzle is solved the player cannot play it again, when all twelve puzzles in a level have been solved the player progresses to the next level. The game has Save/Load functions and a high score table, it is played with the mouse and runs in two windows - the main window which can be moved/dragged around the screen and a small daughter window that shows the colour sequence which cannot.</p>",

The game opens in a window but can be played in full screen mode, it is entirely mouse controlled.</p>\n<p>The bridge bidding system is based on ACOL and the supports following conventions; weak, strong or variable no trump; Standard or Benjamin opening two bids; Stayman and/or Blackwood two club responses; Blackwood or Gerber when slam seeking; and take-out doubles. It also allows the North-South pair to play different conventions to the East-West pair. One of the configuration options can be used to bias the contracts towards either pair which is useful when practising attacking and defensive play</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a useful help file which explains the controls, the basics of bridge and the ACOL bidding system. The shareware version of the game is fully functional other than it does not allow the player top save any configuration changes, while the registered version has additional features such as being able to replay a trick, set up specific hands to play and being able to pause the autoplay feature.</p>",

The shareware version of the game has three levels while the registered 'Professional' version has ten.</p>\n<p>The story behind the game is based on five college students. Their professor is a typical eccentric genius who experiments with insects and radiation in his spare time. What the students didn't know is that the prof's family have been performing experiments for ages in their castle which just happens to be under their dorm. One day one of the students comes across an entrance to the underworld so he and his four companions decide to investigate. The objectives of the game are to explore the dungeons, kill all the bad things therein, discover treasure and escape.</p>\n<p>This is a top-down game with all the action taking place in a small window in the top central half of the screen. Though the player has five characters they do not work as a team, if one character dies another takes their place, usually in the same place but without the weapons, armour or equipment. The dungeons are, naturally, mazelike in their construction with plenty of locked doors, and items to pick up. The character's inventory system is split with general items going into a backpack, and separate items for keys, ammunition etc while weapons and protective clothing are added to the character directly.</p>",

Pelvismania has started on their world just as it did on ours but, while we had the real thing they have nothing so they jumped in their battlecruisers and headed to Earth to kidnap Pelvis and steal Pelvis\u2019 relics. They came in three types of ship, the Hound Dog class, the Heartbreak Hotel class and the Rock-n-Roll class and they stole a Gold Album, Fender Guitar, White Studded Jumpsuit, Peanut-butter &amp; Bananas, Pink Cadillac, 8-track tape, and a Black Velvet Painting.</p>\n<p>The object of the game is to destroy the enemy ships and retrieve the artifacts and Pelvis. It is played in a grid universe where the player warps from one sector to another locating enemy ships, planets e.t.c. however the player cannot warp to any cell in the grid, only those which are adjacent to the current location. The ship has missiles, attack drones and decoy ships as well as shields e.t.c, all of these can be damaged in combat in which case the player must find a safe cell to rest and repair vital systems.

        "description": "<p><em>Quenzar's Caverns</em> is a shareware, single-player dungeon crawl type of game.</p>\n<p>The story behind the game is simple enough, the player is a mighty hero/heroine who has decided to rid the realm of Quenzar an evil wizard who is plotting to take over the kingdom. The game has two skill settings and, according to the accompanying description, an experienced player should complete it in under an hour. There is no save game function.</p>\n<p>The game area is split into four parts. In the upper left is a game map which consists of a 10x10 grid where each cell is a room. In the centre is a compass rose which the player uses to navigate the map and above this are two picture slots which show the current room\u2019s contents. On the left are the characters statistics, strength, amount of gold found etc and below that are buttons for attack, defend, flee and so on. Underneath all of this is are two text boxes one describes the current room, the other lists the actions taken and their results so any messages are received here and in battle the results of each strike are shown here.</p>\n<p>The game plays in a window or in full screen mode and has randomly generated environments so each game should be different. The game environments are numbered and the player has the option of playing a random game or a specific numbered game, number 8655 is used as the tutorial game and is described in a walkthrough which, if played perfectly, can be completed in twenty moves. The object of the game is to find Queznar and kill him/her. However before the player can enter the lair they must search the rest of the rooms for the key and additional equipment, that means fighting monsters and avoiding traps and not wasting any weapons so they are fully armed when they enter Queznar's lair.</p>",

Your mother has died, dad is sick and your sister, Angela, is missing which leaves you on your own to run the family farm. Looking through your dad\u2019s old things for clues to your sister\u2019s whereabouts you discover that years ago your parents were superheroes, dad used to be SuperHim and your mum was Mistress Thumper. Donning your dad\u2019s power ring you set off to find Angela.</p>\n<p>After the optional introduction the player sets the character\u2019s strength, health and agility before assigning extra points on things like heat vision, lightning and body armour. The game starts in the city where you have taken an apartment which is the game\u2019s first location. Each location comes with a series of options many of which are humorous, for example in our apartment one of the options is to make a sandwich so naturally you make a hero sandwich, other options include putting more clothes on \u2013 SuperHer is only wearing a bikini, or taking everything off.</p>\n<p>Outside the apartment the player is shown a map of the city with key locations on it. Some locations lead directly to confrontation and battle while others provide information on Angela or equipment. All battles are shown on a screen with the player on the left and their opponent on the left. The player uses the mouse to decide what action to take, punch, heat vision, lightning etc and the game implements that choice returning a message something like \u2018You Smack your opponent for &lt;2&gt; points\u2019, they then smack you and so it goes until the player either wins, quits or dies. Petty thugs are encountered first and some can be easily vanquished while the major villains are much tougher.</p>",

The ship has photon torpedoes and phasers and shields etc, all of these can be damaged in combat in which case the player must find a safe cell to rest and repair vital systems. There are three skill levels and in the registered version the player can edit the level to change the number of opponents and well as the quantity of weapons their ship carries and how quickly systems are repaired.</p>\n<p>The game is presented as one main window within which are a series of child windows showing ship status, plus strategic and tactical maps. It is played by a combination of mouse and keyboard controls.</p>",

All the boxes come in pairs are the same shape and size. The playing screen starts with some fixed boxes scattered around and it is the player\u2019s job to stack four blocks of the same colour together at which point they are removed from the screen, the level ends when all the boxes present at the beginning are removed.</p>\n<p>The shareware game is called <em>Boxes</em> and contains ten levels and the in-game music is a full midi rendition of Beethoven's Bagatelle No. 25 in A, more usually known as \"F\u00fcr Elise\". The registered game is called <em>Boxes: Championship Edition</em> it has one hundred and fifty levels, more music tracks, more backgrounds and special boxes such as bombs and antigravity crates.</p>",

The game is based on rules similar to those laid down for <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/132385/john-horton-conway/\">John Horton Conway</a>\u2019s of Game of Life. It is a turn based game, when each player has completed their turn the game board is updated. When both players pass the game is over and the score is calculated with the winner being the player with the highest average number of cells throughout the game. In this game the rules are:* Any cell not touching another cell horizontally, vertically, or diagonally will die of loneliness.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Any cell touching four friendly cells horizontally or vertically will be suffocated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Any cell touching three unfriendly cells horizontally or vertically will die from poisoning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new cell will be created when the square is surrounded by two or three friendly cells horizontally or vertically.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If, when the game board is updated a new cell may be created by either player in the same square the player who moved first in the will take the square.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There game configuration options include two levels of AI difficulty, the game board can be varied from 4x4 to 25x20, the number of cells populating the board at the start of the game can be altered as can the number of cells placed in each turn.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Egg Carton Game</em> is a two-player strategy game that can either be played against another player or an AI opponent which has three difficulty settings.</p>\n<p>The game itself similar to <em>Mancala</em>, that game traditionally uses seeds or stones in pits while this game uses marbles in the wells of an egg carton, but the object is the same in as each player tries to clear all the marbles from their side of the game area. The game area is similar too with each side having six slots and right and left \u2018end slots that marbles can be played into but cannot be played out of.</p>\n<p>Each player in turn selects a slot and the marbles in it are removed and distributed around the board in an anticlockwise direction, for example if slot \u2018x\u2019 contained three marbles then it would be emptied and one marble would be placed in cell \u2018x+1\u2019, the second in cell \u2018x+2\u2019 and the third in cell \u2018x+3\u2019. Choosing the right cell is important because the strategy element depends upon the last cell into which a marble is played:* If the last marble drops off the board the player must choose a cell on their side of the board from which to make another move.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If the last marble goes into a cell that has one or more marbles in it, all the marbles from that cell (including the one just dropped there) are removed and distributed counter-clockwise from that point.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the last cell into which a marble is dropped was EMPTY the player's turn is over and the opponent's turn begins.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The game plays in a non-resizeable window and has neither a save game facility or any game statistics.</p>",

Points are scored for each piece of fruit collected and for each crate destroyed but one point is deducted for each square moved.

Starting with the single revealed banana the player clicks on any of the adjacent cells horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The game uses the number and position of that cell to reveal a row of bananas, so if the player clicked on the cell to the right of the start banana and it contained a number five then the game would reveal five bananas in a row to the right and the start point for the next move would be at the end of the line.</p>\n<p>The game ends if the player either touches one of the red spiders, goes off the edge of the game area or attempts to re-use an exposed cell. The game records the top five scores, a player's score being the percentage of the bananas cleared in a game.</p>",

The player controls a red marble that always starts in the top left corner of the grid.

Every thirty seconds the game adds a new green marble to the grid making a speedy clearance of the grid essential. Like Pac-man there are yellow dots randomly placed on the grid\u2019s pathways, when the red marble passes over one of these the green marbles turn white and become vulnerable for a short while and they can be killed for bonus points.</p>\n<p>The shareware version of the game has six levels, the registered version has thirty levels and a save game function.</p>",

In terms of gameplay however the objective of the game is to score points by matching three identical symbols horizontally, vertically or diagonally \u2013 the matched symbols disappear and those above them drop down. To clear a level the player must remove all the \u2018emptiness\u2019 symbols from the screen, they are the grey squares in the screenshots, all levels are timed.</p>\n<p>What makes this game different to most falling block puzzles is that falling icons can be changed as they descend so the player can cycle through the Tai Chi symbols thus making matching symbols easier. The player also has Tai Chi energy can be used to turn the falling block into a Tai Chi symbol, this crashes through the symbols on the bottom of the game area clearing a patch for future matches. The is can be done three times before the Tai Chi energy runs out however the player can generate more by aligning five category symbols in a horizontal line.</p>\n<p>There are two modes of play, the standard mode as described above and an \u2018advanced\u2019 mode in which the falling icon interacts with the block it hits. The shareware game is limited to five levels.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Robot Battle</em> was a programming game in which players used RSL (Robot Scripting language) to create robots which they then used to battle other player\u2019s creations on-line. A fee was charged for entry into these contests, early contests cost $10 to enter but this was reduced to $5 in 1995.</p>\n<p>The game was developed and released by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/857696/brad-schick/\">Brad Schick</a> in 1994 and at that time the robots were 2D and were viewed top down. It went through many upgrades and versions before being sold to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/4959/garagegames-inc/\">GarageGames</a> in 2004.\nThere is a story behind the game which sees robot fighting become legal in the year 4000. As a newly graduated programmer you have been asked to build a fighting robot to represent the Vega system in the Intergalactic Robot Battle Contest. Succeed and you may never have to work again, fail and \u201c<em>you'll probably end up writing new versions of Vega Calculator in some half-forgotten VegaSoft building on one of the twenty moons of Vega Panet.</em>\u201d </p>\n<p><em>Robot Battle (version 1.2)</em> of the software came with these pre-configured robots Corners, Events, Fire, Rammer, Shell, Side and Target. The scripting for each could be viewed and used as the basis for new designs which could then be tested in a local battle and/or be swapped with other members of the community. It came with three .exe files;* winrob.exe: This is the main game and is used to set up local battles between robots</p>\n<ul>\n<li>distrib.exe: Is a program that scrambles a robots code, this is used when swapping robots with other members of the Robot Battle community. Robots scrambled by this process could not be entered into contests, 'plain' code had to be used for that..</li>\n<li>contest.exe: Used to submit player details, robots, and make payments when entering competitions.</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p><em>WinRoids</em> is a shareware Asteroids clone where you have to destroy every asteroid on the level while avoiding being hit by the debris (asteroids get split into smaller parts when hit) and the occasional flying saucers. The game uses newtonian physics which means that you use your thrusters to accelerate in a direction, and the ship keeps moving in that direction and velocity - regardless of the current direction your ship is pointing - until you use your thrusters again to decelerate or change your direction.</p>\n<p>The levels are on a single screen with looped borders. Anything that exits the screen on one side, will enter the screen on the other. This includes your own shots. Apart from the random enemy UFOs, there are also randomly appearing bonus crates containing extra lives, weapon upgrades and shield generators.\nThe graphics are high resolution (for 1994) pre-rendered 2D sprites in cartoon or 50's sci-fi style.</p>",

Each level has a target, for example level one\u2019s target is to form the word \u2018HELLO\u2019 which sounds simple enough but within the word \u2018Hello\u2019 are the words \u2018Ell\u2019 and \u2018Hell\u2019 so if they are completed before the full word the letters disappear and all the preceding good work has been undone. Once the target has been achieved the game continues with blocks falling ever faster until the screen is filled, that completes the level but does not end the game, the player then enters their name for the high score table and moves on to the next level.</p>\n<p>All the falling blocks consist of two letters, words can be made horizontally or vertically and the game can be played either with the keyboard or the joystick. The shareware game has fifteen levels while the registered game has one hundred and twenty. The game also plays in English or German.</p>",

The game is uses card number/rank only \u2013 suits are unimportant. It starts with thirty cards dealt face up, six rows of five cards. The player then turns the cards from the pile of remaining cards over one at a time. These cards are used to match to the face-up cards and hopefully clear runs of cards in one go. <br>\nCard matching is best explained by example; so if a ten is turned over from the card stack it would match to either a nine or a jack on the rows of turned cards. If the player matches to a jack then they can either match that to another ten or to a queen among the face up cards. This process is repeated until there are no more cards that match.</p>\n<p>The game has sound and a choice of card back</p>",

It was released independently as a \u2018taster\u2019 game for their <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Solitaire+Gold+Pack\">Solitaire Gold Pack</a>, anyone registering <em>Treasure Trove Solitaire</em> received the full solitaire suite in return.</p>\n<p>The object of the game is to end up with four piles of thirteen cards all of the same suit, order is unimportant.<br>\nSixteen cards are dealt face down into four piles of four cards, the top card of each pile is turned face up. A seventeenth card is played into the game area, this is the foundation of the first suit. All other cards that are face up are moved to that pile in such a way that their rank remains visible. The value of the first card is doubly important because the piles for the other suits MUST begin with a card of that rank, so if the first pile started with the ten of clubs the piles for spades, hearts and diamonds cannot begin until the ten of that suit becomes available.  </p>\n<p>The other rule for this game is that cards can only be played to their relevant pile if the pile on the left contains a number of the same rank. To continue our example the first pile starts with the ten of clubs and the five and six are face up so they get moved to the same pile. Luckily the ten of hearts is also free so a pile of hearts can be started then we begin working through the pack. The seven of hearts is turned over. Even though the heart suit is being built the seven cannot be added to it because there\u2019s no seven among the clubs that have currently been played. </p>\n<p>The game has sound and a choice of card backs</p>",

When played with casino rules, i.e. no undo / redo and going through the deck three cards at a time, it is quite hard to win but with the use of an undo function some sources claim a success rate of over 30% and with unlimited passes through the deck and turning over one card at a time success rates approaching 90% have been claimed.</p>\n<p>This game was sold separately and it was also part of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/19593/wyvern-studios-incorporated/\">Wyvern\u2019s</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Solitaire+Fun\">Solitaire Fun</a> package. It has an autoplay function, options to play the owner's CD or MIDI music, change the card back, use larger card numbers &amp; two kinds of scoring,it has an undo function and games can be saved.</p>\n<p>The game starts with the game dealing five cards, four cards are available for the player to use and the fifth becomes the first foundation card. The foundation card is important because it's value determined the value of the foundations for the remaining three suits, so if the card turned up was the ten of clubs the player could not start building piles of hearts, diamonds and spades until they had the ten of those suits. Once a foundation card has been played cards are added to it in sequence so in our example the jack would go on the ten, queen on the jack, king on the queen, ace on the king, two on the ace and so-on finishing with the nine.<br>\nIf any of the four face-up cards can be added to a foundation the player does so filling in the space with a card from the top of the deck. The player then goes through the deck playing cards to the foundations wherever possible.<br>\nThis game allows the player to work through the deck either looking at every third card or every card.</p>\n<p>The shareware version of the game only allows a limited number of games before the player is required to register.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the year 2105, all highways are mechanized and automated, rearranged by a central computer in real time to reduce traffic congestion. The player takes on the role of an unscrupulous taxi driver, who has outfitted his taxi with a hacking device, allowing him to take control of the highways and ensure his trips are as long and expensive as possible.</p>\n<p><em>Street Shuffle</em> is a puzzle game where you slide tiles connecting roads, to ensure your taxi gets from one corner of the screen to the other. After a initial delay to allow the player to setup some tiles, the taxi starts moving, therefore the player must think quickly to move the tiles and complete the puzzle before it is too late. The game is similar to the \"connect pipes\" puzzle genre, where instead of a car, it is a liquid that flows. Driving into a dead-end, returning to the starting point, running out of fuel, or repeatedly driving along the same path, all cause the player to fail the level.</p>\n<p>The game also includes a strategy element. After completing every level, the player receives money which can be spent on refueling the taxi, repairing damage incurred by crashing, or buying special equipment (which is necessary to avoid damage or crashing on certain roads). The longer the path taken by the player's taxi, the more money is received for that level.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Adventures of Ninja Nanny &amp; Sherrloch Sheltie is an educational, interactive novel for ages 12 and up. The story follows a cow named Norbertina who lives on a farm near San Francisco but aspires to travel to England and become a nanny. In her quest to save enough money to make the long journey, she gets a minimum-wage job at an ice cream parlor working for two pigs -- names Hog and Doss -- and is later pursued by a variety of villainous characters, including Baron von Moribund.</p>\n<p>Occasionally while reading the story, there are a number of \"hotword\" selections that the player can click on and trigger a graphical scene depicting crude drawings of characters with odd voice clips and sound effects. Throughout the course of Norbertina's adventure, there are also tangential references to geographical and historical items of interest -- such as the Golden Gate Bridge -- which the player can learn more about by reading entries in the game's \"DictioPedia NinjaNannica,\" a dictionary/encyclopedia hybrid that features a number of stock video clips and images.</p>\n<p>A sequel was planned but never released.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Myulk</em> is a combined adventure and farming management game, in Swedish (mixed menu text &amp; un-captioned spoken language).</p>\n<p>The adventure part is a classic point&amp;click adventure with 2D characters in Myst-style 3D rendered backgrounds with a few animations, where the protagonist has inherited a decrepit farm '\u00d6ppna\u00e4ng' (Openmeadow), and needs to get it up and running. This involves a gnome-like figure from the Swedish folklore; a 'Tomte' called Yul, who is traditionally helpful, provided the farmer treats him right; and in this game he gives you advice about the farms various animals and warns you about an ill-meaning tree creature called 'Slymmer' who is trying to make the farm fail and turn into a dark forest.</p>\n<p>The farm and fields are initially overgrown with roots originating from this 'Slymmer' character, and you need to pick up items, navigate mazes and find a means to remove these roots, eventually removing Slymmer from his den (but he is not yet defeated). This takes up the first year of your farming career.</p>\n<p>The second part of the game involves more of a dairy-farm management game, and you have two more years to make the farm economically sound. The actual farm work is not directly interactive, but is represented by the advancing clock/calendar and icons showing the work being done, your job is allocating your time &amp; money to farming tasks of varying urgency.</p>\n<p>You are also supposed to get a number of documents from the nearby 'N\u00e5gelunda' (Sumwhat) town archives to first prove ownership of the farm, then get a bank loan to purchase farm machinery and cows, and you also need a veterinary certificate for your cows so you can lab-test &amp; sell their milk to the Swedish dairy producer Arla (who is also a sponsor and publisher for the game).\nOf course the administrative tasks are a bit convoluted, and requires both flattery and trickery to get the civil servants to do your bidding.</p>\n<p>Things can also break down on the farm, some things can be repaired by yourself, but for other faults you have to call repairmen and to not lose time you may need to hire a farmhand helper to succeed.\nThe time for farming tasks are partly pre-defined, you always need 8 hours to sleep, and 3 hours to milk and feed the cows, but the rest of the day can be used as you wish or need; plowing/seeding/fencing the meadows/mending broken items etc.\nThere is a weather-predictor device (that you have to make work) that tells you of the weather for the next six days, which sets limits on how long you can spend on harvesting on your own, or if you need extra help in case of impeding rain.</p>\n<p>During the second and third years you also have to find more items for a magic weapon to finally banish the evil Slymmer from the farm.\nThe final battle is a series of simple action sequences, and only after a successful battle you will get the blessings of Yul to continue running the farm, provided it also is economically viable.</p>",

Richard Tyler (the movie's protagonist) is sent back to the library world because the Pagemaster has been kidnapped by Mr. Hyde. Now Richard has to help his old friends Adventury, Fantasy and Horror by traveling to their domains and setting things right - and of course ultimately rescue the Pagemaster.</p>\n<p>This is a classic point &amp; click adventure using much animation similar to the movie. The player controls Richard's action through a mouse cursor which is moved through the static images. When passing over an interactive part, the cursor changes its form and clicking starts an action such as collecting an item or moving to another room or a closer view. Puzzles are typically solved by using inventory items. Clues are often scattered around as text excerpts from classic works of fiction.</p>\n<p>A central part of the interface is the \"decision star\" which is used when interacting with other characters and has three options: \"yes\", \"no\" and \"what\". Depending on the answers, points are added or detracted (being a good person pays off) from the overall score points. Solving puzzles or finding clues also change the score. Some puzzles are optional or have alternate solutions.</p>",

Goal!</em> is a remake of the puzzle game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9862/color-lines/\">Color Lines</a> featuring characters from Namco's arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/156049/golly-ghost/\">Golly! Ghost!</a> Like the original Color Lines the game is played on a nine by nine grid where balls of different colours appear. The player attempts to create lines of five or more balls of the same colour which are then removed from the game board. This is done by moving balls around one at a time. New balls will then randomly appear on the board until it is full and no more moves can be made. The aim of the game is simply get the highest score by clearing as many balls as possible.</p>",

Built to resemble a young woman, Rema has the capacity to learn and experience human emotions but appears to be a blank slate. T.C. impulsively decides to help her escape from the people who are pursuing her, and they set out on a journey that will shape the person she grows into becoming.</p>\n<p><em>Rema</em> plays like other visual novels; the story is largely linear, and the player is able to choose actions from a mouse-driven menu.

        "description": "<p><em>Striker: Occulta Lapis</em> is an adventure game presented in the style of an interactive \"talkie\" comic book. It is set in a post-apocalyptic future, where the Solar System has been colonized but the Earth lay in a state of decay and abandonment under an authoritarian alien rule. Striker, the protagonist, is an escaped convict who does not even know what he had been imprisoned for and ventures through the ruins of the old world in search of answers.</p>\n<p>The game interface is an essential point-and-click on a series of images styled like comic book panels, therefore varying in perspective. Every clickable object can be interacted with in one way only - such as walking, talking or using - with no choice of verbs for the player. A multiple-choice interface governs both the dialogue with NPCs and situations where a problem can be dealt with in more than one way.</p>\n<p>The entire game features spoken narration and dialogue (in Italian) throughout.</p>",

The player controls a battleship, moving left and right on top of the screen, while a number of hostile submarines appears beneath. The player can drop depth charges from the right or the left side of the ship. A depth charge destroys a submarine instantly if it hits, but the charges are rather slow while the submarines move fast so it can be tricky to hit them. A maximum of four charges can be released at a time. The submarines occasionally launch floating mines which move upwards, and if they hit the ship the player loses a life.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>David Bellamy's Endangered Wildlife</em> is an educational title which is designed to raise awareness of endangered animals and what the threats to their survival are.</p>\n<p>The title comes in three parts;* The first part is the an animated message to the player from the future where animals are scarce and the environment is in trouble</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The second part is the <em>Discovery Tour</em> in which the player is shown a world map, they click on a continent to get a closer view and this brings up a map with hotspots for a number of animals. Clicking on a creature gives a picture below which are tabs that give details on Habitat, Food, Lifestyle etc</li>\n<li>The major part of the title is <em>The Discovery Game</em> and for this the player needs to create an identity and sign in so that their progress can be recorded. This starts with a screen showing twenty plus animals whose names are displayed when the mouse cursor rolls over it. Clicking on a creature brings up a screen with a curious tiled grid that is actually a series of cunningly disguised mini games. The object is to remove the tiles and display a picture of the animal beneath;<ul>\n<li>Some tiles just disappear when clicked.</li>\n<li>Some tiles disappear when the player clicks on and turns over another tile with the same picture as in a <em>Concentration</em> style game</li>\n<li>Some matching pairs of tiles, the <em>Fun Fact</em> tiles will display a piece of information about the creature before disappearing</li>\n<li>Other tiles are letter tiles, clicking on one of these highlights a row of tiles and a question appears at the bottom of the screen. When the correct answer is entered, as in a crossword game, the tiles will disappear exposing more of the picture</li>\n<li>Other tiles uncover a jigsaw, a sliding block puzzle, a word search puzzle or a game of tic-tac-toe.</li>\n<li>Others present more facts about the creature before they go  </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The game has four difficulty settings All Easy; Progressive - getting harder the more the game is played; Variable - some easy some hard; All Challenging. Once an animal's picture has been cleared it can be viewed again but the games cannot be replayed by the same player</p>",

Players are only offered all three bands if they are carrying sufficient cash so, for example, a player with just 450 could play in bands one and two but not the third.<br>\nPlayers are given a stack of coins/tokens which they drag onto the table to make their bets.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Poker: This offers Five-Card Draw; Five-Card Stud; Seven-Card Stud; Hold 'Em and Dealer's Choice variants of poker. Each can be played with or without wild cards against three or five AI opponents.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Slots: The game offers a Regular or Progressive slot machine and a choice of four stakes. The same machine is used for both games but the Regular machine has a single win line while the Progressive machine has three win lines</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Blackjack: The player can choose between single-deck blackjack; 2-deck blackjack; 4-deck blackjack and 8-deck blackjack with the same three stake bands as are used for Craps etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Keno: This is not a game that a player can opt to play at will. A Keno game starts every five minutes so, for example, when a hand of poker has finished the player can select the Keno option from the menu bar and, if their timing is right, they can complete a Keno ticket. The game is described in detail in the manual, it supports a standard selection of eight numbers and the use of groups.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whatever game is in progress when the Keno game starts is suspended as the keno card is displayed alongside the numbers being drawn</p>\n<p>The game requires 256 colours and will not play in anything higher. It has three game speeds and the option of No Sound; PC Speaker Sound; or Soundblaster Sound.The main menu sits in the centre of the screen, it is overlaid by a smaller window while the player accesses the bank. Each game plays in a window which replaces the main menu in the centre of the screen.</p>",

The boxes will mark in red. Once every box is on a marked spot, the player will go to the next level. Boxes can only be pushed one at a time, so two boxes next to each other cannot be pushed together. If the player gets stuck with the boxes during a level, he can make one move back (using undo), and if he fails, he will need to start the level from the beginning.</p>",

Each lesson consists of;* Word Drill: There are six tiles on the screen with a picture in each, the word in the foreign language is in a caption strip across the top of the tile while the word in American is in a similar strip across the bottom of the tile. Clicking on a tile triggers a voice-clip of the word being spoken in the foreign language.

No pictures this time just caption strips and clicking on the foreign language strip triggers a sound clip of the phrase being spoken</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Word Drill and Phrase Drill sections are repeated up to four times. In between the sections is a picture or a nugget of information such as \"Disliked by the french is sauce anglaise 'English sauce', better known as catsup\"  </p>\n<p>During these sections the player can, if appropriately equipped, record and play back their attempt to pronounce the word/phrase they've been taught.</p>\n<p>When the lesson is over there are the tests, these start with.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Noun Test: A word in the foreign language is in a caption box at the top of the screen while the remainder of the screen holds six picture tiles along with their appropriate American word and the player has to select the tile that matches the supplied word.</li>\n<li>Phrase Test: Here the caption at the top of the screen is a foreign phrase and beneath it are four American phrases from which the player must select the one which translates as the supplied phrase.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In all tests clicking on the foreign word/phrase triggers a sound clip of it being spoken. If the player answers/guesses correctly they are rewarded with the ding of a bell, incorrect answers get a hooter. The game keeps score and at the end of the round gives a message along the lines of \"Seven correct, that's not bad\" or \"Almost made it. You only missed one.\"</p>\n<p>In all lessons the player has the option of just going through the Nouns and Phrases, i.e. Skipping the tests; Nouns Only; Phrases only; or Tests Only.</p>",

This advertises itself as three games in one; Bonus Fruit; Bonus Bars &amp; Bonus Sevens although it is more like one game with three different sets of symbols. In all games there are three reels with a single payout line, also there is a wild symbol which triggers the bonus reel feature in which the player's stake/winnings can be multiplied by up to twenty-five times.</p>\n<p>Other options tucked away in the menu bar are the save feature, options to change the basic stake; the game speed; borrow money from the bank etc. There is also a comprehensive manual that explains the controls.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Shih Dao</em> is a single player, mouse controlled, shareware, solitaire board game played with tiles. It also goes by the name of <em>Ishido</em> .</p>\n<p>The objective is to place all of the tiles onto the board and obtain the highest possible score by following specific rules of play. Tiles can only be placed next to another tile of the same colour or of the same pattern. The player positions them by dragging &amp; dropping with the mouse. As the game area becomes more crowded the player will often have to place a new tile next to two, three or four other times all of which must match in one way or another. This makes the game very strategic in nature as the score for a two-way, three way and a four way match is significant. </p>\n<p>The game has sound, a high score table and an undo feature, it will also optionally show available moves.</p>",

The main objective of the game is to gather the ten hidden treasures and survive the various dangers along the way.</p>\n<p>Movement is tile-based and the player can only move one tile in any direction. Traveling to a hidden tile may reveal a treasure, an enemy, various hazards, helpful items or a blank space. Whenever a enemy is uncovered, a battle automatically starts and the player can only make use of the various weapons available at the time. The player can restock weapons and repair the ship by taking supplies form the nearby islands.</p>\n<p>The memory game aspect comes into play due to 3 helpful items: the map which reveals the closest treasure, the sextant which reveals the nearby threats and the spyglass which uncovers a 9x9 portion for a short period. Memorizing these hints offers the player the upper advantage as health pick-ups are limited.</p>\n<p>Pirate's Plunder is part of a bundle of games named <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Fortune+Pack\">Fortune Pack</a>. The pack includes four games: <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/143989/fortune-raiders/\">Fortune Raiders</a>, <em>Pirate's Plunder</em>, <em>Desert Curse</em> and <em>Cash Quest</em>. <em>Pirate's Plunder</em> and <em>Fortune Raiders</em> were made available as shareware games. Registering the games would have given the user access to the whole pack.</p>",

The game is about teaching basics about physics to a young audience. The player has to analyse physical phenomenas.</p>\n<p>The player's objective is to travel in a as short as possible time span with a set amount of energy and below a defined level of pollution caused by his means of transportation in the fictional country of Kosmoland. The destination can be reached via several vehicles on earth, through the air or on the water. During his travel the player is challenged with several tasks about physic as civil engineering, hydrodynamics, electricity, optical science etc. When the player is successful in solving his challenges, the inhabitants of Kosmoland will provide him some gifts and he can go faster to his destination. But there is always the possibility of an unexpected surprise or obstacle that will complicate the trip through Kosmoland.</p>",

The computer players have three difficulty options to pick from (slow, average, or smart). </p>\n<p>Gameplay revolves around what is to be expected from spinning the wheel and picking letters in order to solve the puzzle. Spinning the wheel is done automatically, the player just has to choose how much power they want to spin it with simply by clicking on a spot on a spin meter. The game records the ten highest earnings for posterity. Also winning three separate games will enshrine the player in the \"Wheel Hall of Fame\".</p>",

In each match the players' objective is to get the highest score across three concurrent scoreboards, shown as three columns on the player's scorecard. The highest total for all three columns wins the game.</p>\n<p>Players click on a cup to roll the dice, then they drag-and-drop the dice to be re-rolled back into the cup and do it again for a maximum of three rolls per turn. The game scores in three columns for each player and scores can be added into any vacant column whenever the player wishes. For example, suppose a player rolled four identical dice in their turn and added their total into the first 'Four of a Kind' column, if on their next turn they rolled another four of a kind they could add it into the second 'Four of a Kind' column. There is no requirement to complete column one before adding scores into columns two or three.</p>",

It provides a visual cross-section explosive view of an 18th century British naval ship. Slicing the warship vertically into ten, finely-detailed sections (Bow, foremast, belfry, forehatch, amidships, waist, main mast, mizzen, aft and stern) and cutting each of those sections horizontally by deck level (hold (bilge), orlop, lower/middle/upper deck, forecastle, quarter deck, poop deck, mast/sails), users could explore each and every part of the ship, and examine life on board a 1700s man-of-war empirical military vessel at the height of its powers.</p>\n<p>Gameplay elements are introduced by having to locate stowaways on the ship, hiding somewhere in the scenery.</p>",

Unfortunately, his spaceship collides with \"the first dinosaur in space\" on his way and crashes on Earth with his spacecraft in pieces. Ronald and friends step in to help out, setting out on a mission to locate all of the pieces of the spaceship.</p>\n<p>This point-and-click adventure game features a heavy focus on minigames. The player character moves around the screen on their own, following the player's cursor. Each area features a different player character, giving the player the chance to control the whole cast. Players can click on various items around the screen to interact with them. Aside from the McDonald's hub restaurant, players can travel to four different areas, each of which has its own minigame and a piece of the spaceship to find. After collecting all the pieces of the ship, players can then travel to McMars.</p>",

There are five mini-games included in the game. First leaking letters must be collected in a shooter mini-game, while collecting fuel and warding off fuel suckers in order to board Illteria's ship. Once on board, the player must coordinate creatures in a complex, dispose of splatterpods and pass an alien-filled maze. Finally an instructions mini-game must be completed so Blasternaut can infiltrate the control room and capture Illitera.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Addit</em> is a collection of four mouse controlled solitaire card games in which cards are removed from the play area if they total a specific number.  </p>\n<p>The games in this collection are:* Tens: The cards Ace through to nine are removed in pairs that total ten. The ten of any suit is discarded on its own while the jack, queen and king are discarded in a three card sequence. The pairs of cards can be cards of mixed suits while the run of jack-queen-king must all be of the same suit.\n* Elevens: In this game cards are discarded in pairs of cards that total eleven, six and five; ten and ace etc. Jacks, queens and kings are removed by collecting one of each, neither the pairs nor the jack-queen king trios need to be in the same suit.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Thirteens: This is a more common form of solitaire. The cards Ace through to Queen are removed in pairs of the same suit that total thirteen eight and five; Queen and Ace etc. Kings are removed on their own</li>\n<li>Fifteens: The cards Ace through to nine are discarded in groups (not pairs) of same suited cards that total fifteen. The remaining cards Ten-Jack-Queen-King are removed in runs of four cards also of the same suit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All games are scored but there is no high score table and the scores are not preserved.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Wa-Tor</em> is a shareware population simulation game.</p>\n<p>The game is based on an article in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=A.+K.+Dewdney\">A. K. Dewdney</a>'s 'Computer Recreations' column in the December 1984 issue of Scientific American entitled <em>Sharks and fish wage an ecological war on the toroidal planet Wa-Tor</em>. The game starts with a population of fish and sharks. The player can adjust the age at which each species breeds and reproduce and how long a shark can go without feeding before it will starve. These factors determine how fast each population grows and is eaten. The object of the game is to tinker with these parameters and find a stable population dynamic.</p>\n<p>The game is played using the mouse and there are usually two windows present, the main window and one of the graphs which monitor population, age profile and predator/prey ratios</p>",

The paddle can hold five tiles only but as well as catching tiles the player can also place tiles in the bins beneath the paddles. By dropping tiles into the bins to make columns, rows or diagonals of the same colour the player scores points.</p>\n<p>The full game has fifty levels each with its own specific goal.

The game can be played with another person or against the computer. It consists of just two screens, the World Screen Map which is where all computer play takes place and the Continent Screen Map which is where the player fights individual battles.</p>\n<p>It is the first version of the game to play under Windows and features one hundred and thirty-nine countries, double that of the previous version. This is a shareware Risk-like game in which the player starts as the ruler of one country and sets out to rule the world playing against up to six computer opponents at once.  </p>\n<p>In this game world opinion has coalesced into four political movements The Populist Movement; The Militarist Ideology; The Socialist Ideology and The Realist Movement. The player starts the game with fifty-six divisions in a random country and expands by conquering and assimilating other countries. The player starts the game having been assigned to one of the four main political movements. A randomly selected number of other countries around the world are also assigned to the same movement, these are not allies but they will be easier to conquer than countries aligned with opposing movements.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Merlin: The Quest For The Wand</em> is a game in which the player takes on up to three AI players on board game like quest.</p>\n<p>In this game the computer rolls a dice and the player(s) can move that number of spaces around the game map but only in one direction. The object of the game is to travel around the map of the islands opening treasure chests looking for Merlin's wand which they must then take back to the blue castle to win the game. <br>\nOn level one the players search the map for a specific treasure , a key, which they must take to 'The Gate Of Billium' which will open level two. Level two plays in exactly the same way but this time the search is for the wand.</p>\n<p>Treasure chests can only be opened when the player lands on them - it is not enough to just pass over them. Chests may be empty or they may contain gold or silver bars which are used to pay for things in the game such as travelling on a ship between islands An added complication that if one player lands on top of another then they rob that player of all they are carrying so finding the wand is one thing but keeping it and getting home safely is another.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Solitaire Golf</em> is a single player, mouse controlled, charity-ware card game.</p>\n<p>Golf Solitaire is a simple, classic solitaire game in which cards are disposed of based on number only, the suits being irrelevant in this game\n It starts with thirty-five cards dealt face up, seven columns of five cards. The player then turns the cards from the pile of remaining cards over one at a time. These cards are used to match to the face-up cards and hopefully clear runs of cards in one go.\nCard matching is best explained by example; so if a ten is turned over from the card stack it would match to either a nine or a jack on the rows of turned cards. If the player matches to a jack then they can either match that to another ten or to a queen among the face up cards. This process is repeated until there are no more cards that match.</p>\n<p>This game has no scoring system and no sound.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Topsy And Tim Go To School</em> is an educational title for children aged four to seven years old. \nThe title consists of a number of activities;* The Story: There are two story activities, in the first the player reads trough the story page by page from start to end while the second activity allows the player to access any of the fifteen pages individually  </p>\n<p>The story itself is a short, positive, story about Topsy and her brother Tim and their first day at school. Each page has a couple of short sentences on it which can be read by the child, adult or by the game. Many pages have interactive hotspots so, for example, when they enter the classroom the player can click on the clock and watch the hands move round, or on items on the table and watch eggs hatch, the snail move, flowers wilt and grow back etc. It's effectively a guide for pre-schoolers showing what they can expect.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jigsaws: There are five jigsaws to be played but these are not traditional jigsaws. Players pick a picture from a many and when it is shown on the screen the picture is still more or less whole but several shaped pieces have been removed and it is the player's task to replace them. This is a game for young children so all the pieces are shaped differently - there's only one star, one circle etc.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>To play the game the player clicks on a piece and it is then 'stuck' to the mouse cursor so there's no need to hold the mouse button down while dragging the piece into position.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Painting: This activity has seven line drawings from the story and some simple point and click painting tools</li>\n<li>Games: There are two games available. The first is a Rock-Paper-Scissors game which can be played as a one or a two player game. The two player game makes use of a single screen so player one makes their selection and a curtain comes down to cover up their part of the screen. Player two then makes their selection which is also covered by a curtain then the game reveals both player's choices and there's a short animation as the winning character (on screen) jumps up and down. <br>\nThe single player game is played the same way with the computer making their selection without waiting for the player.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The second game is a weighing game in which the player picks up objects with the mouse and tries to find two that weigh the same. The range of objects is quite diverse a pen, newspaper, bunch of grapes, sausage, light bulb etc.</p>\n<p>The game does not transfer the contents of the CD to the player's computer, the installation process just creates a program group with links to the programs on the disc.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This compilation contains three games:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Schiffe versenken (Battleships)</li>\n<li>Minenfelder (Mine Fields)</li>\n<li>Grid War</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Schiffe versenken</strong> is a version of the classical <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/8553/genre-board-game-battleship/\">Battleship</a> game. 5 ships with lengths from 1 to 5 will be randomly placed on a 15x15 grid. Now both the computer and the player will try to find the opponent's ships by clicking on any of the fields. Hits and misses will be marked accordingly. The first player to sink all enemy ships has won.</p>\n<p>In <strong>Minenfelder</strong>, the player has to cross a grid of 20x20 fields and reach the other side without hitting randomly placed mines. It's possible to choose from three different vehicles (varying in the amount of mines the player can hit before the vehicle is destroyed) and select the difficulty. The vehicles contain a radar which indicates when one (yellow) or more than one (red) mine is located within one of the 9 adjacent fields. The vehicles also provide a one-time use mine detector, showing the position of the mines for a very short time.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the other two games, <strong>Grid War</strong> is a real-time game: on a 17x20 field, the player has to shoot the opponent. The ship will move between grid fields, the direction will only be changed when the ship has reached the center of a field. As it will take some time to completely move to the next field, this makes the ship vulnerable to attacks during that time. Each player's ship can fire an unlimited amount of \"bombs\", but the next bomb can only be used when the previous one is not on the field any more.</p>",

The software comes in three parts, or separate applications, as well as a demo for the video game adaptation of the book <em>The Escape of Marvin the Ape</em>, by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Caralyn+Buehner\">Caralyn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Mark+Buehner\">Mark Buehner</a>, also by Vroombooks.</p>\n<p>Players will be greeted by Cybee, a flying robot with a penchant for all things outer space. She will guide players through the \"activity selectivator\", which has four games per app. The first three teach important computer skills, and the fourth reviews new words and terms in a more scholastic setting. In the fourth game of each app, a calmer female voice spells out words like \"mouse\", \"cursor\", \"double click\", \"monitor\", \"keyboard\", and \"spacebar\", followed by a purple cartoon alien character interacting with the computer part, first incorrectly, and then correctly.</p>\n<p>In application one, Cybee has games to teach kids how to point with the mouse to reveal images (pointing removes squares covering the image), clicking where the cursor makes sound, and clicking on what object is making sound. In application two, Cybee teaches kids how to double-click and click and drag. In application three, Cybee teaches kids about the keyboard, including pressing random keys to see what happens, using number keys to select music, and painting lines with the arrow keys. The instruction game also teaches about Caps Lock, the spacebar, and the backspace or delete key.</p>",

In addition to the factual information this title has a quiz section in which the player can answer questions on States, Capitals, Bird, Region, Flower, Abbreviation, year of Statehood, Nickname, Song and Tree.</p>\n<p>When the quiz starts the player is asked how many questions they want to answer. All questions are asked in a daughter window, some questions put a cross on the appropriate state so the question window changes position so as not to obscure it. In all cases the player must type their answer. An example of a 'States' question would be <em>\"What is the name of the highlighted state?\"</em>. A cross will be shown on the map of the USA and the player must enter their reply, correct spelling is important but answers are not case sensitive</p>",

It comes with a default aircraft the North American T6-Texan which can be built, painted, modified and exported into the flight simulator for use.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The menu has been designed to look like the map of an aircraft factory with separate functions for parts, components, structures, assembly and paint shop. There in-game are tutorials to guide the player through the lengthy process of creating an aircraft.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The ATC Workshop - This allows the player to create their own air traffic controlled adventures, flights from one place to another, with APL - the Adventure Programming Language.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The installation process of this product will upgrade <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 5.0</em> to version 5.0A as well as bringing in other changes such as new instrument panels for prop and jet planes allowing up to four engines and a MACH number on the airspeed indicator. Installation also adds two options to the Flight Simulator's drop-down Options menu:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Design Aircraft - which allows the player to edit the flight dynamics of aircraft they create</li>\n<li>Adventure Factory - which lists the flights the player creates</li>\n</ul>",

The box cover claims that over fifty IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) are installed with this product with the main adventure being a full flight from New York to Boston. All flights, including the New York to Boston adventure are located in the main drop down menu within the Adventure Factory option. By default, when started, the New York/Boston adventure uses the standard Flight Simulator Learjet with its jet aircraft flight panel, this can be changed within the Flight Simulator configuration options but, disappointingly, the supplied Dash 8-300 uses the same flight panel as a Cessna and not a jet aircraft panel. The Flight Simulator's 'Land Me' option cannot be used with the new aircraft. </p>\n<p>When the main adventure starts the default aircraft is sitting on the tarmac at JFK airport, New York, however the action does not begin immediately as the player is taken through a series of configuration options which determine the difficulty of the flight. Each option is announced by a warbling bleep and the player must make their choice within six seconds as the setup process automatically advances from one option to the next. The options are;* To fly with NO HELP at all press 'm'</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For displayed CLEARANCES, press 'CTRL-p'</li>\n<li>For in-flight HELP, hit 't'</li>\n<li>For CO-PILOT to change RADIOS, hit 'f'</li>\n<li>For a shorter flight, hit 'h' - if this option is selected then the next two questions are not asked.</li>\n<li>For A Martha's Vineyard flight, hit v</li>\n<li>To fly at 7000, not 15000, hit 'k'</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After passing on all these options the player is told they are at JFK airport and that the full flight is 'very hard', even with all help enabled and the short flight selected the player is warned that this is not for the novice. A further warning states that a pen and paper are essential - this seems to be to keep track of headings and radio frequencies throughout the flight.</p>\n<p>When the adventure starts the player is given the tower's frequency and once they request clearance to take-off they are given both on-screen and audio instructions for the headings, altitude and in-flight frequencies to use and they're off.</p>\n<p>Should the player crash, a booming voice announces 'Nice flying, Ace' and the adventure is over.</p>",

The first stage runs under Windows and copies files from the disc onto the users machine, when this is done an 'Installation Complete' message is displayed after which a DOS window opens and a file extraction process begins. </p>\n<p>Once installed the player will find three new aircraft, a DH DASH 8-300 in white Sim Air livery, a twin engine Air Rescue Cessna 414-A and a single engine Rescue Air Cessna 182 RG - the last two are in red livery. In the Adventure Factory drop down menu there is an entry for \"Rescue Air 911 - The Game\", the new adventure which is described as a mix of flying skill and strategy. The game is set in the town of Simville which has eight areas containing injured people. The player's task is to fly rescue missions to bring the injured to the Mallard Memorial Hospital before their fuel runs out, the plane having enough fuel for forty minutes flight and no more. Completed missions earn money and the tame's objective is to earn as much as possible before time runs out.  </p>\n<p>The game communicates with the player with audio air traffic control messages as well as text which appears in a bar above the instrument panel.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dominoes For Windows</em> is a computer version of the Dominoes variant \"Sniff\". Players compete across a series of rounds, trying to be the first to exceed a minimum score. </p>\n<p>During each round, players extend the chain of dominoes on the table by placing dominoes from their hand on either of the chain ends; dominoes can only be placed next to pieces with matching dot numbers. The first time a double-sided domino (with same dot number on both ends) is placed during a round, it becomes a Sniff, and it can be used as a starting point for two additional chain branches. A player gains points when the number of dots on all the chain ends adds up to a multiple of 5. When a player empties his entire hand, he receives bonus points, the table is cleared and the next round begins. </p>\n<p>The game offers three difficulty levels for the computer opponent, an autoplay (computer vs computer) option, an advise option that suggests a move, and a few minor rule variations. </p>\n<p>Later versions of the game add a second Dominoes variant, \"Fives &amp; Threes\", and the option of a domino set with up to nine dots.</p>",

The coloured tiles change colour but when one of them turns black it stays black. The player's task is to click on all of the target tiles to complete the level before all the other tiles turn black. In addition to the target tiles there are other special tiles;* Bonus tiles. These are coloured tiles that, briefly, change to show a bonus which range from 2X to 5X, clicking on these boosts the player's score. Clicking on a bonus tile just after it has changed back to a coloured tile causes it and surrounding tiles to turn black.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A Replay Arrow. This consists of a tile showing three chevrons. This tile moves rapidly and randomly around the screen, clicking on it causes all black tiles to become coloured again however, as with the bonus tiles, clicking and missing causes more tiles to turn black.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Boogeyman: This is a black tile with a blue face in it, it bounces around the screen occasionally restoring targets that the player had removed. When it appears the player is unable to score until they click on it and remove it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

Eventually he became bored with both so he combined the two, thus creating 'The Demon Car' and happily drove around killing as many people as he could. Eventually he died and his son took over as king. The new king had the 'The Demon Car' upgraded ad he happily followed his father's example.</p>\n<p>The new king eventually grew old but had no queen and no children. Who was to succeed him? He came up with a plan, whoever could drive is demon car the best would take the throne.</p>\n<p>Thus begins the game. The player has been summoned to show their skill, and complete disregard for human life, by driving the demon car and killing as many serfs as possible within a limited time. The game is keyboard controlled and is played on a single screen. People pop up randomly and the player's job is to run them down. Once hit their target it turns into a cross which then becomes an obstacle in the race to find the next victim, as the game progresses the number of crosses grows and the game becomes harder.</p>\n<p>The game has four skill settings, a high score table and a choice of screen sizes.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the popular TV series starring Angela Lansbury, <em>Murder, She Wrote: Mystery Jigsaw Puzzles</em> is a murder mystery game starring the famous detective Jessica Fletcher, albeit without the participation of Lansbury herself.</p>\n<p>The game features four different murder cases, in which the facts of the case are first presented to the player via audio narration and FMV cutout dialogue among the various characters (though Fletcher is just presented as a static Lansbury headshot and voiced by a different actress). The player must then assemble a jigsaw puzzle of the crime scene and examine it for the clues which can implicate the guilty party. Once the player has selected the character they believe is the murderer, Fletcher then reveals the culprit along with further explanation on how the crime was committed.</p>\n<p>The jigsaw puzzles have several configurable gameplay options, including background color, piece shape (curved or square), and sound effects. The puzzles can also be cut into 24, 48, 80, 130, 154, or 187 different pieces to vary the difficulty level, with 187 being the default.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Atom Killer</em> is an adventure game in Italian. The game tells the story of Atom Loew, from his childhood in a future version of the city of Bologna, to his adulthood, when he's transformed into a cybernetic killer with an atomic heart.</p>\n<p>The game is divided in three sections, which you can access at any time. One of them is an interactive database where you learn about the world and the protagonist, with text, images, and voice recordings. The second one is a traditional point and click adventure, done in a mixture of pre-rendered 3D graphics and 2D graphics, and with complete voiced dialogues. And in the third one, you guide Atom in a series of action sequences, where you control what happens by influencing him as if you were his \"guardian angel\" (that's the term used in the guide in-game).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ego: La Leggenda del Drago Distruttore</em> is an adventure/strategy game in Italian. The story takes place in a fantasy version of the Middle Ages, where the evil Arakh, High Priest of the Cult of the Spider, seeks to conquer the world. Gerard, a paladin of Charlemagne who also appears in the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/198122/la-spada-della-foresta-vivente/\">La Spada della Foresta Vivente</a>, recruits Ego, the titular dragon, to fight against Arakh and his cult.</p>\n<p>You play as Ego, and gameplay involves selecting different destinations on a map of the world. On these destinations, appearing as fixed pre-rendered 3D images and sometimes with short animations, you will find items and allies who pledge to fight alongside Ego, but also enemies that you can fight in simple turn-based battles, while also meeting with Gerard and helping him get to different places. You also have 5 different stats which you can replenish in some destinations: Flame, Vigour, Perception, Virtue and Karma.</p>\n<p>In addition, there's a \"Hypertext\" section that acts as a historical index where information can be found about dragons and different places, myths and legends of the world.</p>",

In this game the player is presented with a face on which grow zits that the player has to pop with a needle. Points are scored for each zit popped however zits that are missed turn into scars.</p>\n<p>The game has six different faces but only one, Joe Pimple, is available in the shareware version. It also has many customisation options; the round time can be varied from ten seconds to one minute; it has three levels of difficulty; and the maximum number of scars that trigger 'Game Over' can be varied between zero and one hundred.</p>\n<p>The only sound effect used is a ding when the timer runs out and the round ends. The game ends after ten rounds or when the scar limit is breached.</p>",

Players choose between two mechanically identical scenarios after starting the game: <em>Busy Billy Wonderland</em> and <em>Busy Billy Fantasy</em>. The story is also the same: Billy finds a magical remote control and is transported into a fantasy world with four mini games:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Billy is standing in one of four single-screen pictures. The player chooses between eight items (e.g. a hand, a magnet or a flashlight) and clicks on visible items. A short animation triggers when a valid combination is found.</li>\n<li>One of the four screens is broken up into nine scrambled segments. The player has to recreate the correct picture by switching two tiles at a time.</li>\n<li>Billy is presented with an obstacle and the player has to choose the correct item in order to proceed. This is the only mini game which has a different graphical representation in the two scenarios.</li>\n<li>Up to eight items are lined up on a film reel. Depending on the choices, different animations are played afterwards.</li>\n</ul>",

The player takes the role of Captain Cock who has to travel to the space station in order to destroy their transmitter.</p>\n<p>The game is a simple single-screen shooter. The player moves the cross-hair of a weapon in first-person and uses it to shoot naked, female aliens which pop out from the rendered background. If the player is too slow, they manage to shoot back and lower Captain Cock's health bar. Sometimes there are also naked men which should not be shot, but doing so has no adverse effect except wasting ammo. Health and ammo can be refilled by shooting the corresponding symbols flying around. After finishing the shoot-out successfully, the player has to solve a puzzle before moving on and eventually being rewarded with a hardcore porn clip.</p>\n<p>On the disc are also four trailers (hardcore and softcore) for the publisher's web and phone sex services. They can be accessed from the main menu.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Alley Cats is a mouse-controlled one-player bowling game with a pin-up twist.\nThe goal is to knock down as many pins as you can. Scored points can then be spent to 'interact' with girls that hang around the alley.</p>\n<p>The game itself consists of three bowling alleys that must be completed in sequential order. The alleys are not notably different in terms of graphics or difficulty.\nThe alley girls, Candy, Rachel or Elizabeth, can keep you company if you wish, but apart from reading out one-liners depending on how many points you score, they do not affect the gameplay.\nThe bowling alley is viewed from a diagonal down-perspective, with the points, pindicator and selected throw-style displayed on top.\nClick the throw-style you want to use - Straight, Hook, Curve or Backup, hold down the mouse button and move it up to throw a ball. Moving the mouse in a straight vertical line always results in a Strike.</p>\n<p>Between the bowling games you can enter the Pro-shop where you can buy better shoes to increase your score, view high-resolution pictures of the girls, or watch striptease previews.</p>\n<p>Having completed the three alleys, a pin-up room opens where you spend your points on viewing striptease acts of the girls. These are basically low-res Apple Quicktime movies that can also be viewed from a Windows file folder.\nHaving spent all your points, you return to the bowling alleys for a new game.</p>",

It is licensed from the <i>Barbie</i> doll brand. </p>\n<p>Inside the scene studio, players can create scenes which are later used to make the movie. The available items are: the setting (the background image), the items in the scene (for example a butterfly or a fish bowl), text (as introduction for the scene; optionally a narration can also be recorded over the microphone), music, characters (normal characters can follow a path which the player draws into the scene and others have a special animation like sitting down) and special effects (e.g. a sunburst or a sound effect). The created scenes can be spliced together in the editing studio and the complete movie is viewed in the screening room. The game also features a paint studio where the available background images can be recolored or players can create completely new images to be used in the scenes.</p>",

This board game takes place on a 7x7 square board, with both players starting with two pawns in the opposite corners. Each turn, a player can move one of his pawn two spaces away, or clone a pawn onto an adjacent square. Putting a pawn next to an opponent's pawns converts them to the player's pawns. The game is finished when one of the players has no more pawns, or when the board is filled completely, at which point the player with more pawns wins. A player can pass a turn at any time.</p>\n<p>The game offers both human-vs-human and human-vs-computer modes (the computer player has four difficulty levels). In the human-vs-computer mode, winning against the computer allows the player to compete on a different board, with some squares blocked off and inaccessible to either player.</p>",

Both participating hamsters are identical in look and abilities: they can move, duck, jump, block and attack. The goal is to win the round by emptying the enemy's energy bar with successful attacks.

The goal is to be as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>There are four playing modes: drag and drop (the player can switch any two tiles), perfection (like drag and drop, but the video re-scrambles if both pieces end up in a wrong position), slider (a classic sliding puzzle: the player can only switch the blank tile, which is always the bottom right tile, with an adjacent one) and random corners (like slider, but the blank tile can be from anywhere). To increase the difficulty, the video orientation can additionally be changed to upside down or inverted.</p>",

Each topic is introduced with an introduction text narrated by a talking head (literally) followed by a number of sub-categories. For example, the animal topic has monkey, reptiles, birds, animal drawings, etc. Each of those lead to a matching game in two categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Lotto: dragging a number of pictures to the corresponding picture.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Memory: a standard <i>Concentration</i> variant. Depending on the category, the matching pictures are either identical or related. For the videos topic, only the memory game is available: one card is a short video and the matching card is a still image from the video.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

The player needs to decide if another object fits the perspective and, if yes, where it has to be placed. If the choice was correct, a point is earned - but a wrong choice rewards a negative point. The goal is to accumulate as many points as possible before the timer runs out.

Additionally, the player can drop toddlers and animals in the room which also have different animations depending on the place. Each item can be transformed (either another color or a completely different item) by either choosing the magician, the fairy or the fool and clicking on it.</p>\n<p>In each room, the player can also solve a simple task (e.g. bathing the dog in the bathroom) and find the hidden lodging of the mice.</p>",

        "description": "<p><i>GemStone</i> is a falling block puzzle game: there are combinations of differently colored blocks falling down from the top of the screen. The player can shuffle the positions of the blocks and should place them on the board in order to create either horizontal, vertical of diagonal lines of identical colors. Then the blocks disappear and the other placed blocks fall down accordingly. </p>\n<p>There are 100 levels which differ in the initial state of the play board, the combinations of falling blocks, the winning condition (how many lines have to disappear) and the threshold (how many identical blocks are required to form a disappearing line). When the player manages to create longer lines than required, they may meet the Not threshold (also changes from level to level). Then they are rewarded with a special effect (essentially power-ups) which helps to solve the level, e.g. eliminating a complete line of the playing board.</p>\n<p>While the game can be manually saved at any time, it also features a password system. By entering the one available password, which is hidden within the game, the player unlocks the option to create custom games.</p>",

        "description": "<p><i>The Great Math Adventure</i> is an educational game which aims to teach math skills to kids between six and nine. The player accompanies Lil' Howie on his adventure through six activities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Big Time: This mini-game is about the calendar and the clock. The player has to answer a number of questions, e.g. ordering the months correctly.</li>\n<li>Blasteroids: This is a top-down shooter completely played with the mouse. The space ship can be moved horizontally or vertically in order to shoot space mines and asteroids. The asteroids have a number written on them which is either added (blue) or subtracted (red). The mines can only be shot when the overall number is exactly the same as written on the mine - but colliding with anything sets the number back to zero. The goal is to shoot as many mines as possible before the ammo runs out.</li>\n<li>Catch A Match: The player has to match formula and result in this <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Concentration+/+Memory+variants\">concentration variant</a>.</li>\n<li>Fractionizer: The player has to build a house by creating the correct wood lengths. This is done by using the correct fractions.</li>\n<li>Ice Cream Match: The player has to complete a pattern with the correct number</li>\n<li>Soaker: The player is given a formula (either addition, subtraction, multiplication or division) and has to click on the correct answer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The games can either be played through the Great Adventure mode (the game chooses what activity to play and tallies up all points) or selected individually.</p>",

        "description": "<p><i>The Great War: 1914-1918</i> is a turn-based strategy game set during World War I. It is played on an overhead map of Europe where the player either controls the Allies or the Central Powers. The main interaction is clicking on troops and giving them orders like moving, defending, attacking, etc. Which actions are available is decided based on the ZOC (Zone of Control) which basically means which nation has control over a territory. Each action costs GNP which stands for a nation's readiness to continue the war - if it runs out, the nation will have no recourse for enemy attacks and cities will be conquered without resistance. When GNP is zero and no cities are left, the nation surrenders. The only ways to gain GNP is either the automatic gain twice a year or transferring them from allied nations.</p>\n<p>The game is based on historic execution of the real war. This means, for example, that some happenings (for example the US entry of war) are fixed and the nations have advantages and disadvantages, e.g. not every nation receives GNP twice a year, the Ottoman Empire has a max limit of six GNP or Great Britain/USA will never surrender because their cities are not part of the game map. The winning conditions are different for the Allies (Russia has to be kept in the war and a armistice reached by November 1918) and the Central Powers (Russia has to surrender until October 1917 and a armistice avoided).</p>\n<p>The registered shareware version unlocks the option to play as the Allies as well as an alternative scenario in which Germany concentrates its troops on Russia instead of France.</p>",

The player can move left and right and shoot directly upwards. However, there are obstacles in the way which bounce the shots around the screen (similar to pinball bumpers). Each correct word rewards points.</li>\n<li>Scary Stories - A <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/8673/genre-word-number-puzzle-word-search/\">Word Search</a> game, in which words can be forwards and backwards. This is followed by a rotate squares game, where combo words must be made.</li>\n<li>Peanut Scale - A <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/8672/genre-word-number-puzzle-hangman/\">Hangman</a> variant , in which the play must guess Howie's secret word, one letter at a time.</li>\n<li>Cheese Game - A <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/8460/gameplay-feature-whac-a-mole/\">Whac-A-Mole</a> variant. The player has to hit the rats which carry words matching the given definition, e.g. all words which rhyme with \"land\".</li>\n<li>Ballroom - Various cartoon characters sing and dance. The player has to choose the correct rhyming words in order to keep the song going.</li>\n<li>Attic - Several items are represented by their name and a picture. Now the player has to choose the correct one which matches the given definition, e.g. an animal which swims.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The games can either be played through the Great Adventure mode (the game chooses what activity to play and tallies up all points) or selected individually.</p>",

There are no right or wrong choices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The last section, Melody Madness, evolved around numbered bottles which are filled with different amounts of water. The three mini-games are:\n- Clicking on the correct bottles (the correct numbers are written out) to re-create a song. Alternatively the player can use the bottles freely to create a new melody.\n- A <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Gameplay+feature:+Simon+says\">Simon Says</a> variant.\n- Filling the bottles with the correct amount of water in order to match the given music notes.</p>\n<p>All mini-games except Melody Madness were already included in previous entries of the series.</p>",

        "description": "<p><i>NFL Math</i> is an educational game which aims to teach children about math. Each play is resolved by solving a math question which is always set as text problem. The goal is of course to answer as many questions as possible so the own team wins the match. The questions are divided into four categories (Number Sense, Geometry, Algebra and Statistics &amp; Probability) and have four difficulty levels. The matches itself are either single or playoffs (a series of six matches).</p>\n<p>The team also has a power level for six statistics (three defense and three offense) which can be improved by playing mini games:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Running/Run Defense: The player controls an athlete who automatically drives forward on the field with a motorcycle. Obstacles are avoided by moving left and right. The goal is to move as long as possible without crashing.</li>\n<li>Blocking/Tackling: The player controls an athlete (left and right) who automatically moves forward on the field. The goal is to get close to enemy athletes to attacking them by pressing the space bar.</li>\n<li>Pass Defense: The player controls two athletes (left and right) which are positioned besides each other in the middle of the screen. The goal is to intercept passes by enemy athletes who are positioned at the top and bottom of the screen.</li>\n<li>Passing: This is the only mini-game which has a first-person perspective (the others are diagonal-down). The player moves the athlete's hand left or right and has to pass the ball to another player. Unfortunately there are a multitude of moving obstacles on the field which should not be hit.</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p><i>Jeopardy</i> is an adaption of the TV show of the same name. It closely follows the original ruleset: the game board has 30 fields which are divided into six categories and five difficulty levels (each marked with a certain money amount). One of the three candidates chooses a field, is given a hint and has to answer in form of a question. Most of the time, all candidates can buzz in to answer the question. However, when a daily double field was chosen, the candidate can bet some of their money and answer the question without interruptions. A correct answer rewards the money, but a wrong answer means the amount is subtracted from the candidate's score and another candidate can buzz in. After all fields are answered the second round is exactly the same with doubled money rewards and risks. The third round has only a single question and the candidates have to bet a certain amount of money before the hint is revealed.</p>\n<p>In this adaption, the question part (e.g. \"Who is...\") is already filled out and the player only has to type in the relevant part.  It features 60000 question and live-action video from the host and the candidates. It can be played with up to three human players or against the AI.</p>",

Each lesson, representing a step in Kewala's journey, introduces new letters and general advice like the correct posture. The majority of the time is spent with typing the given sentences. At first those are just letter combination to practice the already introduced parts, but later those evolve into complete words and sentences. After each lesson, the player is given a statistical analysis of the performance and the option to participate in a bonus challenge. Here the player has to type as fast as possible within a time limit. The game keeps track of the player's overall points. Besides doing well in the lessons and challenges, the game also rewards bonus points for feats like doing multiple lessons in a single day.</p>\n<p>Besides the training adventure, there is also the Royal Challenge for players proficient with touch typing available. Here the player types short stories.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <i>Kid Vid Grid</i>, the player has to unscramble a running cartoon. The number of tiles is variable, including progressive options where the video directly re-scrambles with a harder difficulty after it was solved. The goal is to be as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>There are four playing modes: drag and drop (the player can switch any two tiles), perfection (like drag and drop, but the video re-scrambles if both pieces end up in a wrong position), slider (a classic sliding puzzle: the player can only switch the blank tile, which is always the bottom right tile, with an adjacent one) and random corners (like slider, but the blank tile can be from anywhere). To increase the difficulty, the video orientation can additionally be changed to upside down or inverted.</p>\n<p>The nine cartoon clips are licensed from Hanna-Barbera cartoons: <i>Snagglepuss</i>, <i>Huckleberry Hound</i>, <i>Darstadly and Muttley</i>, <i>Dino and Cavemouse</i>, <i>Pixie and Dixie</i> and <i>2 Stupid Dogs</i>.</p>",

However, they don't work with specific tasks or theoretical explanations. Instead the rooms are set up with various buttons and tools. Those are designed for learning about the topics through experimentation. If a player needs guidance, clicking on the light bulb gives a suggestion what to try next. </p>\n<p>The five houses are the Instrument Inn (learning about various musical instruments), Scale Shack (rhythm and scale), Rhythm Room (rhythm), Mirror Mansion (adding variations to musical notes) and Concert Castle (combining everything to create full songs).</p>",

        "description": "<p>Scandal in 1697: the Queen's necklace was stolen from the French court! Now the player has to assist Louis Cat Orze, the pet of Louis XIV, to investigate the crime and catch the culprits. Each day (the investigation takes place over six days which can be freely changed from a menu), the player can visit various locations in Versailles and the court. Inside the single-screen locations, the player can click on persons and items to trigger dialogue (without participation of the player character) or acquire hints like notes. The winning condition is visiting the king during the last day and answer multiple-choice questions to name the perpetrator and proof.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the player may need to fulfill prerequisites to enter a location, e.g. a key has to be acquired on a previous day to unlock a locked room. Every location switch also costs money - and visiting the king is the most expensive of all. After the starting budget of 1000 Livre is spent, it is time to earn additional money by correctly answering trivia questions about the time period. Especially lucrative is the palace challenge which can be found by clicking on the hidden spot in each location.</p>\n<p>As this is an educational game, there is a lot of historical reference material available. Double clicking on a person opens up a portrait where both a written and a narrated biography from the character's point of view can be accessed. Understanding the who is who of the court is vital to solving the game. All biographies can also be accessed from the hall of portraits. The library has a collection of educational texts about the time period and the map room shows the world geography of 1697.</p>",

        "description": "<p><i>Microsoft Complete NBA Basketball: '94-'95 Season</i> is an encyclopedia about US basketball. It offers records, team and player databases; a season almanac and historical information about the sport. </p>\n<p>Most importantly, there is also a trivia game. Here the player has to solve one multiple-choice question after another (usually four answers, sometimes two). When manually ending the game, the program calculates the correct answer percentage for the high-score list. There is no ending condition and it is possible to temporarily leave the game to look up the answer in the database. In the pregame warm-up mode, the player has three guesses (although only the first counts for the statistics) and the game gives an explanation about the correct answer. In the all-star challenge mode, the game directly jumps to the next question after the first answer.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Sparky's Tangled Tales in Spellingsburg</em> is a spelling-focused edutainment game aimed at children between the ages of 3 and 6. The game stars a talking TV set named Sparky in his home of Spellingsburg. There are three modes of play, representing difficulty levels: Hide and Seek, Spelling, and Super Spelling. The first of those is a simple game mode aimed at the youngest players with no spelling involved, while the latter two are identical save for harder words on Super Spelling.</p>\n<p>The object of the game is to go around Spellingsburg picking up souvenirs from each of its locales. You must first locate Sparky in the location, and then if you picked Spelling or Super Spelling, you will play a quick minigame in which you are given a visual representation and a hint for the word you need to spell in the form of a video clip. If you can spell the word all the way out without making any mistakes, you will get both of the souvenirs you need, but if you make a mistake, you will only get one. If you make two mistakes, you will get either one or none, depending on what Sparky decides. Once you gather all the souvenirs, they will be placed randomly across a \"tangled tale\", which is a mad libs story.</p>\n<p>The game is fully played with a point and click interface and features a hand-drawn art style. The game also includes two extra video clips to introduce children to the alphabet and phonics.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>13 Out</em> is a solitaire card game played with a standard 52-card deck. It is a variant of the solitaire game \"Canfield\". The objective is to move all cards to the four foundation piles, each built of 13 cards of increasing value and of the same suit.</p>\n<p>The game begins with one card dealt into the first of the foundation piles, determining the starting rank for all foundations. For example, if a 9 is dealt, each foundation must start with a 9 and continue sequentially, cycling through the deck. An available card can be placed on a foundation pile at any time, but once placed there, it can no longer be removed.</p>\n<p>Below the foundation piles is a tableau of four piles, each pile initially containing a single face-up card. Each pile of the tableau can be extended with cards of descending value (King is considered one lower than Ace) and alternating colors. An empty tableau pile can be filled with any available card. Cards can be moved between the tableau piles, singly or in groups. However, only the top card of each tableau pile can be moved to a foundation pile.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a reserve pile of 13 cards is set up at the beginning. At any time, only the top card of this reserve is visible and available for play.</p>\n<p>The remainder of the deck forms a stockpile. The player can turn over cards from this stockpile, in a way which depends on the chosen gameplay mode: it can be one card at a time, or three cards at a time, where only the topmost revealed card is available for play.</p>",

Since the building slots use combs.</p>\n<p>The position of the monster is chosen randomly after starting a new game and obstacles (which can be turned on or off) interfere with the available road.

This assists players in developing card counting strategies.

The player takes control over an explorer who has to collect 16 treasures in the pharaoh's pyramid. Every of the 16 screens has obstacles like traps and zombies which are deadly to the touch. While the traps have to be avoided, the zombies can be shot with the explorer's unlimited projectiles. Besides treasures, there are also keys to collect which open closed doors and ropes to climb. The three lives act like a life bar, i.e. the player's position is not reset and there is only a brief frame of invincibility.  There is no fall damage.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Pipe Dream</em> is an unofficial conversion of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/2112/pipe-dream/\">Pipe Dream</a>. The mechanics are identical to the original game: The game places a pipe on a random location of a 7x10 grid. Then the player places other random pipes (the next five can be seen in a preview) on the grid and connect them to each other and the initial pipe. The goal is to create a pipe network which keeps liquid into circulation as long as possible. Said liquid starts flowing from the initial pipe after a few seconds of play. It is possible to replace pipes with a new one as long as the liquid didn't reach it yet. Afterwards points are rewarded and retracted based on the player's performance. </p>\n<p>The biggest difference to the original is the absence of different levels. There is only the choice between normal and fast speed.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Prairie Dog Hunt 2: Judgement Day</em> is a shareware shooter. A bunch of prairie dogs pop out all over the screen and the player's job is to move the crosshairs over them and shoot before they leave the screen. The biggest changes compares to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/218634/prairie-dog-hunt-for-windows/\">predecessor</a> are the extended playing area (i.e. the screen can be scrolled left and right) and the absence of rabid dogs. This means the only danger is not scoring enough points for the high-score list. The player can freely switch between four weapons (pellet gun, magnum, rifle and SPAS-12) which all have their own ammo pool. The number of dogs can be set freely between 10 and 100 and there are four difficulty levels to choose from</p>",

The setting is a war for the neutral Altarian sector which shortly before declared their independence from the Imperium (which was formed after the so-called first conflict). Now various Empire factions battle for control over Altarian.</p>\n<p>The only graphical element is the map of the star system where the planets can be selected with the mouse. Everything else is done in menu screens which can be accessed over the command bar. The basic gameplay loop: At the start of each turn, each star system receives points which are calculated from the number of factories and morale. Those points are used to build units (ships and defenses). Those units can be sent to other systems in order to conquer them. Combat results are calculated without further player input.</p>\n<p>The winner of the match is the faction with the most points after the match has ended. Said end comes when all human players are defeated, only one active player is left, the turn limit was reached or when a player achieves an optional victory term (can be set in the match setup). Reaching this victory term wins a lot of points, but does not guarantee overall victory. A game has between two and ten factions and all of them can be human.</p>",

After choosing one of the locations, the bait (dry or wet) and the line type (floating or sinking), the player casts the line and waits for a fish to bite. Then the player needs to quickly click on the \"set hook\" button and reel the fish in. In this phase, there are two buttons to press: \"reel in\" and \"reel out\". It is important to balance the two buttons because reeling in too fast means the line breaks and too slow means the fish gets away. The last decision is to throw the fish back into the water or keep it.</p>",

The overall story (now set in 2006 instead of 1996) and the gameplay stays largely the same with an updated UI. The big new feature are live-action videos.</p>\n<p>We write the year 2006. After the democratic revolution, Russia has transformed into a national autocracy and a war between them and NATO over Ukraine and the Baltic states is imminent. The player takes control over Sparrow, a new computer agent of the Umbra spy organization. First assigned to investigate a suspicious car accident, he soon becomes the prime suspect himself...</p>\n<p>The gameplay is completely focused on the COPNET computer platform. Here the player receives video messages (which are transcribed for later access) and reads documents. There are three ways for interaction: using the phone, the research function or the datasphere. When using the research function, the player types in a topic or name which is then researched by the system and eventually brings up related documents. The datasphere is an AI which holds archived records (such as video messages) and is used to retrieve DNA from objects and compare them with other DNA. Additionally, the player may use it to analyze or compare documents to find discrepancies. Both research and datasphere actions are restricted to a few operations at the same time.</p>",

The city is side-scrolling (it wraps around the sides) and has a lot of houses. If eyes are seen at a window, the vampire can knock at the door. Then the victim runs out and flees: the goal is to run after him and suck him dry. Alternatively the victim can also be turned into a zombie which can be controlled independently from the vampire for 30 seconds. After biting the required number of victims, the protagonist can return to the graveyard \u2014 failing to to do so until sunrise (6:00 am) means final death. </p>\n<p>Besides the time limit, there are three other dangers to look out for: werecats slow the player down, vampire hunters throw stakes which drain blood and raven eggs freeze the vampire for 20 seconds. All of them have a countermeasure: running away from werecats, biting ravens and using zombies to kill vampire hunters.</p>",

Each turn, players produce units which are then moved over the map to defend or attack cities. Before starting a game, the player(s) chooses the level of complexity: in the lower two, they only have access to pre-made units while the high complexity allows the production of customized units. The victory conditions are either cap kill (capture the enemy's capital), total destruction (destroy all enemy units and cities) or economic victory (hold a certain amount of cities for a certain amount of time, both variables are set at the beginning).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Wheel of Fortune: Deluxe Edition featuring... Vanna White</em> is a video game based on the TV game show <em>Wheel of Fortune</em>. It works just like the original: three contestants try to guess a phrase or a similar text by spinning the wheel and then naming a consonant (vowels have to be bought with earned money without a spin). If it is included in the phrase, they are revealed and the candidate can spin again. Each correct consonant rewards money based on the dollar amount the wheel landed on. However, the wheel can also land on a special field, e.g. a free spin or bankruptcy. After a wrong guess, the next candidate is on unless a free spin has been collected. Each active candidate can try to solve the phrase.</p>\n<p>The fourth round is the speed-up. Here the dollar amount is determined beforehand and each candidate has to guess one letter (vowels are free) and then has one try to solve the phrase. One candidate then proceeds to the bonus round. Here the game automatically reveals the letters R, S, T, L N and E and the candidate has to choose three additional consonants and one additional vowel. After all is revealed, there is one try to guess the phrase.</p>",

This is done by jumping between galaxies (represented by a 7x7 grid), searching for warships and using the two weapon systems (torpedoes and phasers) to fight them. Other commands are using short range or long range sensors to find Romulans and managing the energy distribution between weapons and shields. Movement commands for ships and probes have to be entered with specific commands (e.g. ship movement needs heading, distance and warp factor) which have to be calculated with a in-game calculation tools. There are also tools to calculate time and energy consumption.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Yacht</em> is a shareware game which simulates the dice game of the same name. Compared to the original rule set, it adapts some aspects of <em>Yahtzee</em>.</p>\n<p>Each player rolls five dices up to three times. After the first and second throw, they can choose what dices to re-roll. Afterwards, they have to commit to the result and choose one of the score categories. Each of the categories represents a combination of dice results and rewards a different amount of points. For example, if the result has three fours, the player can either choose the \"Fours\" or the \"Three of a kind\" category which both reward 3*4=12 points. Each category can only be chosen once per match and filling all six number-categories (\"ones\" to \"sixes\"), bonus points are rewarded. The goal is to score as many points as possible after 13 turns.</p>",

There is also a stack of 20 cards with only the top card face up, which can eliminate any card from the columns which is one number higher or lower (Ace after King and vice versa does not count). The game is won when all seven columns are eliminated.</li>\n<li>Kings Corners - The entire deck of cards must be placed on a grid of 16 spaces without the player getting stuck. Kings always go in corners, queen always go on sides, and jacks always go on the top or bottom. When the grid is filled, cards can be eliminated if they add up to 10.</li>\n<li>Fortitude - Works a bit like Klondike Solitaire in the Vegas mode with FreeCell mechanics and no kings or queens. The layout consists of six card columns with two empty spaces and a stack of Fortitude cards. Its important never to draw a Fortitude card unless it is needed. If the entire fortitude stack is drawn and there are no moves to perform, the player is stuck.</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p><em>Cloak, Dagger and DNA</em> is a turn-based strategy game for four players. Players can be human, inactive (does not move and does not create new armies), or AI. Human players also get an AI, which can be asked for advice. The game supports remote play via network drive.</p>\n<p>The map has a number of areas that contain multiple tiles. Control passes between player per area, not tile. Most areas contain factories, which produce a certain amount of income per-turn if owned by a player. That income can be used to purchase armies, one per factory, as well as maintain those armies, one per factory. Combat is simple; every two armies can destroy one enemy army each turn if they exist in the same area. The game features simultaneous moves, where after all order have been entered, the game resolves everything. Victory occurs if one player controls 75% of the factories, eliminates all opposition, or has the most factories on turn 50.</p>\n<p>The DNA in the name refers to the genetic algorithms that can be used to develop AI players. While the game comes with some AI programs, it also allows the creation and customization of new AI players in automated tournaments.</p>\n<p>This game was distributed as shareware. The registered version included a map/scenario editor, and allowed editing some game rules.</p>",

        "description": "<p><i>Kloks</i> is a puzzle game, based on the \"Rubik's Clock\" puzzle. The playfield is a 3x3 grid of nine clocks. Each clock has two hands: an upper one (light blue) and a lower one (dark blue). The four corner clocks have both hands aligned together at all times, whereas in the central and edge clocks, the two hands can move independently. At the start, each clock hand is pointing in a random direction. </p>\n<p>Only the hands of the four corner clocks can be manipulated directly. Each corner clock is associated with a pushrod, which connects the clock's hands to three other clocks. The color of each pushrod can be changed by clicking, between light blue and dark blue. If the pushrod is light blue (dark blue), rotating the hands of the corner clock also rotates the upper hands (lower hands) of the three connected clocks.</p>\n<p>The puzzle is solved once all the clock hands point to 12 o'clock.</p>",

The main difference from <i>Boggle</i> is that there's no requirement for the letters to be connected. Any letter can come after any letter. The other difference is that this is a single-player game. Score is still based on the number of words found, and the length of each word.</p>\n<p>The game has three difficulty levels; on lower difficulty levels some common letters will always be present. The amount of time given can also be adjusted. There is a high-score table.</p>",
