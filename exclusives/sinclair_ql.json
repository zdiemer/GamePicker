        "description": "<p><em>3D Slime</em> is a fast game that mixes the munching from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a> with the isometric perspective from the contemporary <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/19458/gyroscope/\">Gyroscope</a>. Players control Green Slime, a green piece of slime from Vega 3 that has been captured by a certain Rodrick. He forces Green Slime into Robocity to steal purple pyramids for him. Green Slime needs to collect these while avoiding black bowling balls by hopping from one tile to another. For each collected pyramid points are scored and all of them need to be gathered to move on to a new environment. The pseudo 3D levels are often built in irregular patterns with inaccessible black spaces and separate areas that are reached through a single path and with a different elevation. To get there the bowling balls need to be lured away to clear the path. High scores are stored directly on the cartridge and it includes a boss key that immediately draws a fake spreadsheet called MEGACALC IV.</p>",

When the ship enters the Bermuda Triangle it is taken over by aliens and the crew vanishes. The game consists of 192 screens and to win three codes have to be collected to form an anchor and regain control of the ship. The rooms are filled with objects and moving obstacles that have to be navigated around. The character can also jump and fire at aliens to kill them. Other control options are running, picking up an object and dropping it. The latter two are used to solve small environment based puzzles. There are three lives and two meters at the bottom of the screen. One shows health (energy) and the other shows the status of the Powerpac. Health can be restored by eating food. It is one of the few QL games to support the QTalk speech synthesizer.</p>",

The player controls an astronaut in several single screen levels with some platforms. The astronaut can freely move around the screen, hovering using a jet pack, and can shoot left or right to defeat aliens that appear from the sides of the screen. The goal is to repair elements of a space station. Every now and then a piece appears. It can be picked up by the astronaut and needs to be dragged to an area marked in red to start the assembly. Once all pieces have been found a switch can be activated to move on to the next level. The game keeps track of the score and five lives are provided at the start. When dead, the astronaut immediately respawns and no progress is lost. A later, updated version of the game introduces a screen where the starting level can be selected. The game supports two players taking turns.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The King</em> is based on the 1981 arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/574/donkey-kong/\">Donkey Kong</a>. Just like in the original game, a man needs to reach the top of a tower by climbing ladders to rescue a girl, while a large monkey throws barrels. There are broken ladders that cannot be used to climb, but the barrels can use them to descend instead of just rolling down.It is possible to pick up a mallet to smash the barrels instead of jumping over them. There is no timer, but fast completions are rewarded with bonus points. If any of the barrels reach an oil barrel in the bottom left corner of the screen, a flame spawns that chases the character. There are a limited number of lives and several levels. The game can be played by two players, taking turns. Optionally a practice game can be played.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>TRON: Light Cycles</em> is an updated release of the 1986 QL game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Light+Cycle\">Light Cycle</a>. Originally a type-in game only published in the December 1986 issue of the German magazine 68000er Sonderheft and also released in the public domain afterwards, it was updated inspired by the release of the 2010 movie <em>Tron: Legacy</em>. The author received permission from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Walt+Disney\">Walt Disney</a> to release the game with <em>TRON</em> in the title.</p>\n<p>The game is played in a single screen arena where two players, or a player against the computer, each steer a light cycle, represented by a white line. The light cycles can be moved in four directions. They leave behind a permanent trail, slowly filling up the arena. To score you need to force the other rider to ride into your line or get him stuck crashing into his own line or the arena border. The game can be played locally with two players or using the QL Network. It is possible to change the speed, the difficulty of the AI and the general difficulty of the game. The latter introduces mines in the arena from the start and these need to be avoided. The game also contains a new splash screen to reference <em>Tron</em>.</p>",

The second phase is the actual shooting phase. In a single-screen environment the player controls a space ship near the bottom of the screen, attacking ships that appear near the top. The waves need to be destroyed before they take out both the shuttle and the main ship. The game keeps track of the score.</p>",

Each solar system has each own resources and economy and it is up to the player to analyse these price variations to take advantage of them.</p>\n<p>While travelling there are many factors to take into account such as the cost of fuel and the risk of losing cargo when attacked by space pirates, but taking risks also leads to the highest profits and options to bargain when selling and buying. The gameplay consists of several single screen with separate parts for a camera view of the environment with icons, a data screen and a communication window with text. A sequence is also shown when travelling between planets. Fights with space pirates are displayed using a top-down view.

Some rooms have batteries used to restore energy, but picking them up when it is not necessary can lead to an overcharge. Optionally the QTalk module can be used for speech.</p>",

The vehicle is moved around based on a thrust mechanic to accelerate along with the ability to turn left or right.

For difficult situations there is also an air brake that stops the vehicle right away, but this can only be used once per screen.</p>\n<p>The overall goal is to reunite the world by collecting and bringing together items. For the West they are teacups and for the East it is bottles of vodka. There are pirates patrolling the streets and the vehicle also needs to avoid guns that fire. There is no way to shoot.

        "description": "<p><em>Metropolis</em> is a top-down flying action game set in a large world made out of 50 fixed-screen environments linked together. The vehicle is moved around based on a thrust mechanic to accelerate along with the ability to turn left or right. The same forward thrust is used as a brake, but then the vehicle needs to be turned around 180 degrees. For difficult situations there is also an air brake that stops the vehicle right away, but this can only be used once per screen.</p>\n<p>The overall goal is to reunite the world by collecting and bringing together items. For the West they are hamburgers and for the East it is red stars. There are police cars patrolling the streets and the vehicle also needs to avoid guns that fire. There is no way to shoot. There is a limited amount of lives. The screen also shows the current location (East or West), the score, the amount of items, the remaining ships for the current life and the remaining fuel.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Wreck Dive</em> is an action game with puzzle-solving elements based around a diver exploring the wreck of the ship The Spindrift sunk in 1954. The diver is in search of treasure as it is rumored wedding gifts valued at around $1 million were on board. The game environment consists of six decks and 140 rooms to explore. Using a top-down view the game environment takes up about one third of the screen largely in the center. The left side of the screen has large vertical area showing the remaining oxygen. Near the bottom the current location is shown and the right part has descriptions of the environment and feedback on actions.</p>\n<p>While exploring the diver often needs to return to the air tanks to top up the oxygen again. There are hazards and creatures such as giant clams that can trap the character. The diver is controlled directly using the cursor keys and often needs to be move between the decks. Many items and elements are hidden in the environment and require careful examination. To defeat certain creatures, specific items need to be located, such as a speargun in order to deal with a shark. There are also cutters that need to be located to open up passages, a painting plays an important role and the diver needs to find a way to crack a safe by finding the right combination.</p>",
