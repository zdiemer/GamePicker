You can deploy a depth charge at any point in the grid. After the depth charge is destroyed the sonar equipment of your ship can detect the echo on the submarine and the distance of the submarine to the explosion. The submarine will try to move away, but it can only go up and right in the grid. Only a direct hit destroys the submarine. When hitting within five squares it counts as a minor hit. After four minor hits the submarine quickly speeds off to a new position where it is repaired. An updated version of the game restricts the submarine to the initial 100x100 grid and also gives a direction after each depth charge.</p>",

The player is told the distance towards the new location, which can be anywhere in the 100x100 grid or beyond it (but only up or to the right). The player needs to perform a direct hit to destroy the submarine. When hitting within five tiles the submarine receives a minor hit.

At higher ranks the game will also become more difficult with more and more difficult targets. The player can earn a promotion three times. Each mission allows the player to fire six times at incoming alien invaders. There are five different types of enemies which require different actions from the player such as firing immediately when spotted, waiting until the right moment or not firing at all in the case of a highly explosive mine. Another possible encounter is a friendly supply ship which obviously shouldn't be shot either. Unlike most shooting games there's no aiming involved, it's all about timing the shots. The game features audio which can be picked up with an AM transistor radio.</p>\n<p>The game has three game modes: a training simulator which doesn't keep persistent score between missions, the extended mode where the player starts at the lowest promotion level and gradually levels up and the simplified game where players can choose a specific difficulty and fly a single mission. The last can be used to play hot-seat multiplayer and compete for the highest score.</p>",

It plays like a turn-based version of a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/8154/genre-light-cycle/\">Light Cycle game</a>. The game is played on a board with 15x10 tiles. The players take turns placing blocks on the board with the rule that a placed block (except the first) must be adjacent to a previously placed block by the same player. The goal is to cut the other player off so that no more valid moves are possible. After each turn the state of the board can be printed.</p>",

The outlaws will be spread out over the four locations randomly.
