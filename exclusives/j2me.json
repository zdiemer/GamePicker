This includes natural barriers such as houses, trees and water, but also bombs and fire-breating dragons.

To progress, you have to use items, given at the start of the game or collected while playing. There are mirrors to reflect fire, a wand to rotate dragons or mirrors, a bomb to clear obstacles, torches to detonate bombs or melt ice, and water to pass through fire for an instant.

        "description": "<p><em>Animal Land</em> is a puzzle game based on animals' food habits. Using <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tetris\">Tetris</a>-like gameplay, you have to guide blocks falling down the screen. You make them disappear by creating matching pairs. If the stack of blocks reaches the top of the screen, the game is over. Unlike other puzzle games, pairs are not created by creating lines, or matching shapes or colours. Each block consists of food and/or animals. Align an animal horizontally or vertically next to related food to have it eaten and have the animal disappear as well. Common pairs are squirrels and nuts, monkeys and bananas, cats and fish, mice and cheese, dogs and bones... with gameplay reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/2342/baku-baku-animal/\">Baku Baku Animal</a>.</p>\n<p>While falling, blocks can be rotated or moved sideways. By delaying matches, you can create chain reactions. There are also a few special items such as a quadruple, a vertical and a horizontal bomb, and stones that cannot be removed unless they are linked to a match. Three different game types are available. In the stage mode, you level up by making a set amount of matches, in the animal mode you play as animal looking for specific food, and the skill mode offers unlimited and uninterrupted gameplay.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The mobile version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Constantine\">Constantine</a> is based on the movie of the same name, inspired by the comic book <em>Hellblazer</em>. John Constantine went to hell and back, and he has been given the burdensome gift of recognizing both angels and demons on earth. He uses this ability to exorcise demons possessing humans, but when his friend Beeman is kidnapped and John is ambushed, he goes after one of the demon leaders: Balthazar.</p>\n<p>The story is based on both the book and the film, and includes many familiar locations and characters. However, major elements of the film, such as the relationship with the cop Angela, have been left out, and the introduction mentions a girlfriend called Ellie. She is John's girlfriend in the comic book, and not mentioned in the film. Still, you'll act out many of film's scenes, including exorcising a demon from the Spanish woman Lopez, meeting Papa Midnite at his club that acts as a safe zone for both sides, and fighting the demon Balthazar. John can also cross over to hell, through water.</p>\n<p>The game is shown through a top-down view. You spend most of the time fighting demons. The creatures are usually hidden from view, and when your awareness meter flashes, you can activate Illumination magic to reveal them. John can also cast Groundswell to attack multiple enemies at once, and Shadowstride (invisibility) to sneak around. In regular combat, you use your fists and a holy shotgun. Magic can only be used scarcely as it needs to regenerate. The game consists of eight short chapters. To advance, you have to talk to other characters to get on Balthazar's trail. Next to the use of magic, the fighting and the sneaking, there also a sequence where you have to perform exorcism by copying increasingly longer key patterns. After finishing a section, your progress is saved automatically.</p>",

One day, seven dwarves, living in an enchanted forest, meet Snow White when she enters their forest. Unfortunately, she is soon abducted by an evil queen. In this game, you have to defeat the queen's minions to get the girl back.</p>\n<p><em>Gnomes Gone Wild</em> is a platform game where you control a single dwarf through twenty levels. Each level consists of multiple regions with knights. Your only weapon is a wooden board, and you have to jump at the knights from a lower level to stun them for a moment, quickly climb up, and hit them with the board. The knights leave behind mushrooms that slow you down or reverse your controls, but they can also give you extra speed. You only have a short time to complete the level. Otherwise, a bloodhound will chase you around, and the enemies move much faster.</p>\n<p>When the dwarf is on the same level as the knights, they can be stunned but not defeated completely. You can move between different platforms using entrances, ladders and jump pads. Collecting flowers will give you bonus points. Your health is shown through a number of sausages. Hits take them away, but some levels contain extra lives. Each level also holds a U-sign that stuns all enemies at once, but only for a moment.</p>",

Each of the three locations consists of two sequences: side-scrolling fighting with Caim alone, followed by a flight sequence on the back of the dragon. On the ground, Caim's moves include sword combos with a finishing blow, blocking, jumping, a dash attack and a dragon attack. To launch a dragon attack, you have to fill your magic meter with finishing blows. Once complete, you can summon the Red Dragon to attack all enemies on the screen, except for the bosses. Each ground level is followed by a duel against a boss.</p>\n<p>During the flight sequences, you control the dragon carrying Caim. You have to take out all incoming enemies and projectiles with fireballs and destructive spells or use the escape move for tricky situations. The game also incorporates some RPG elements: you gain experience by defeating enemies. These points can be used to level up, rendering attacks more powerful and expanding the maximum amount of health. Additional experience points are based on a time bonus and the stage score.</p>\n<p>Although the story of the original game is only vaguely mentioned, all missions have an introduction explaining your mission and the setting. There is a high score list and you can upload your score to an online ranking board.</p>",

Using non-scrolling vertical gameplay, you have to defeat over 50 enemy waves including bosses. As you progress, the attack patterns become more complex with larger and more powerful ships. There is only a limited amount of lives, but by eliminating series of spaceships, you gain bonuses such as extra lives and improved firepower. Top scores are stored in a high score screen.</p>",

You'll need to guide her through 16 stages to retrieve the cat. The entire game is played in a non-scrolling screen where enemies appear above you. You can only move sideways and shoot upwards with your wand. The stages have been grouped in worlds with a castle, a forest, a volcano or ice as a backdrop. Each level has the same enemies, but as you progress, they become quicker and attack in groups. The ice world is the hardest level, as Stella will glide a bit and is harder to control.</p>\n<p>Enemies consist of bats, dragons, giant red balls, dragons, skulls and demons. Some shoot projectiles or drop bombs, while others will try to isolate you by starting fires on the ground. For every 5,000 points, an extra life is awarded. By destroying entire waves of specific enemies, you are also granted fruit for bonus points, temporary invincibility, and new weapons with multiple bolts in different directions or a vertical line that kills anything that touches it.</p>\n<p>In between every two levels per world, there is a bonus game where you have to shoot spiders to keep them from stealing your treasure chests. Scores are saved in a high score table and they can also be uploaded to an online ranking list.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The mobile version turns the Call of Duty franchise into a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/482/commandos-series/\">Commandos</a>-like squad-based shooter. With a group of allied soldiers, you have to take on the Nazi Wehrmacht in missions all over Europe, from D-Day to a tank factory, the Pegasus bridge, crossing the Volga river and infiltration missions in a P.O.W. camp and a dam. Before each assignment, you are given a short introduction of the environment and a team selection is suggested based on their abilities. You can only select three team members per mission.</p>\n<p>The objective is always to reach a spot marked by a red flag with as many team members alive as possible. The different classes include infantry, a sniper, an engineer, a medic and a commando. You control only one unit at a time, but you can order the other ones to follow you or to take cover. The other members are controlled by the computer's AI and will engage enemy soldiers on sight if you order them to follow you. You can switch between team members to move them around or to use their special abilities. All members can fire regular bullets, in four directions, but a medic can heal your soldiers, the sniper can shoot the entire screen when there is a clean line of fire, the infantry has grenades to blow up objects or doors and the engineer carries heavy explosives. The final unit, the commando, can pass through locked doors and stays undetected for ten seconds in a new room. This time frame can be used to sneak up on enemies and take them out with your knife.</p>\n<p>Each unit has an armour class and you can pick up items on the battlefield: a medi-pack to restore health, a crate to restock your secondary weapon and a flak jacket granting invincibility for ten seconds. Although it is sometimes possible to finish missions with a single unit, you will often need the different classes to get past obstacles. There is only one type of enemy soldier and they can shoot in eight directions. The fastest time per mission is stored as a challenge to beat.</p>",

The story is revealed through in-game sequences with a few unexpected twists when the Sentinel robots appear.</p>\n<p>The game consists of three acts with various members of the X-men team in isometric levels. You cannot control multiple characters at the same time, or switch at will, but you need to work together to progress. Playing as Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Iceman, Cyclops and surprisingly even Magneto, you have to use their unique abilities. Each characters has specific moves, attacks and abilities. Wolverine is all about brute force, while Nightcrawler can teleport, Iceman can slide through air, create ice blocks, put out fire and freeze enemies, and Cyclops can shoot through his eyes. Not all of these moves are available at once, you have to look for various hidden mutant cores to upgrade your skills. Opponents include Pyro, Silver Samurai and Master Mold, and both Rogue and Prof. X. make an appearance.</p>\n<p>The game combines beat-em-up sequences with basic RPG elements and puzzle-solving. You need to destroy or move statues and blocks, and use the abilities to get past obstacles. Special moves drain your power gauge, but both power and health regenerate over time. Pick-ups include mutant cores for upgrades, power-ups to expand your health and power meter, and X-points to improve your score. After each act, you are graded based on your performance and a high score list has been included.</p>",

Played from a top-down perspective or a full 3D view if you have an advanced phone, you can choose from 34 countries to compete in various events. The names have not been licensed but each country has been assigned a skill level true to their actual capabilities. In the main career mode, you control team Playman and compete in 33 events over the world, divided over three stages, to improve your skills. After completing a challenge, you are awarded skill points that can be assigned to speed, attack or defense. Events include full tournaments, friendlies, sudden death situations and penalty shoot-outs. Other game modes offer warm-up, arcade games and quick matches.</p>\n<p>Each team consists of 8 players and you can set the formation before the match. Moves include tackling, passing and shooting, along with a run boost, crosses and super shots with large effect that need to be powered up. All players run automatically, you only need to move them into the right direction. The goalie cannot be controlled. There are different pitches, weather types and you control the length of the game and the fouls. Gameplay time and records are stored in a high score screen.</p>",

You can either practise, take on the computer, or play against three other human players (hot seat) to get the best score.</p>\n<p>You always start on top of a ramp. While going down, you have to tap left or right to compensate for the wind. When you cross the red line, you keep a button pressed to gain speed and release it once you have left the ramp. In the air, you have to keep a steady V-formation and tap another button to land safely. Five judges rate your jump based on the length and style. Each track consists of two jumps and if you get first in a singleplayer track, you qualify for the next and unlock it for other modes. There are nine multiplayer opponents and a high score screen per track.</p>",

The visitor is incredibly wealthy and terribly naive, so you have to protect them from all the dangers and crooks.</p>\n<p>The city consists of 16 sections, shown through an isometric perspective. You only control Rincewind who nudges Twoflower in the right direction. The tourist wants to visit five locations: the Unseen University, the Patrician's Palace, the Temple of the Small Gods, the Brass Bridge and the Whorepits in that order. Some of the lurking dangers are thieves, the character Death, carriages, swamp dragons that explode when petted, and Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler's Sensational Sausages.</p>\n<p>You can view the different sightseeing spots on a city map. Twoflower only has a limited amount of lives, but Rincewind helps by throwing coins to distract thugs and he uses a picture box to blind civilians. In difficult situations, you can also call The Luggage just once, and it will eat everything on the screen. There is some paint hidden in certain sections to keep the colours in your picture box stocked.</p>",

Three are available right away, while the other eight are opened up gradually each time you complete the championship mode. Each car has characteristics based on top speed and acceleration.</p>\n<p>The championship mode consists of six tracks set in Missouri, Alaska and Nevada. If you come first on a track in the championship, it is made available for quick racing. You race against seven opponents on courses with bright colours reminiscent of the TV series' visuals. During the race, you can collect power-ups such as oil slicks to slow down opponents, turbo for a boost, lightning to halt the car in front of you, and a shield to drive through obstacles and cars for a short moment. Each car also has a unique power-up, such as a high jump, flying or speed rams.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>War of the Worlds</em>, the film based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=H.G.+Wells\">H.G. Wells</a> novel of the same name, the focus is on mankind in a struggle against a strange alien invasion. In this take on it, however, the events are turned around as you command a tripod in its quest to exterminate all humans. In the thirteen levels, set in Osaka, London, New Jersey and apocalyptic wastelands, you guide the alien through side-scrolling levels, destroying anything in sight.</p>\n<p>You can move the tripod, as well as the main turret to target waves of enemies. Each level ends with a boss attack where you take on a giant tank, submarine or a flying bomber, or prevent a ferry from escaping with human passengers. Many events follow the movie, and the order of the locations is also kept intact. Although you will spend a lot of time fending off enemies, time is the most important factor. You are much stronger than your enemies, so they will often charge with kamikaze attacks to slow you down. Buildings will also prevent you from moving steadily, and these need to be removed as well.</p>\n<p>Health is shown as a power bar in the bottom left corner. You can collect power-ups to recharge it, and these grant more powerful ammo at the same time. Your enemies include tanks, helicopters, jets, bombers and motorboats. The tripod can also hold a maximum of three bombs - these destroy anything on the screen. During the missions, CNN-like reports are shown with information on the humans' return attacks.</p>\n<p>As the waves of multiple enemies increase, you no longer have the time to fight them one by one. Instead, certain formations' units are highlighted in red. If you destroy these first, they will cause a chain explosion taking out the entire wave. Another way to trigger this is by shooting mines that humans have deployed. These will jump up and cause damage in the air. As a tripod, you can grab units and mines from the ground and launch them at incoming enemies. You can also capture humans for bonus points using the same technique. Aside from providing massive points, chain explosions provide additional seconds to your time limit, to recover when you have been slowed down.</p>",

The cat robots will try to stop you, but these can be taken out using your paws, or by picking up a pan, a racket or a broom - although taking them on barehanded will get your more points. Garfield can be moved in four directions and there a single key to punch. You have three lives and lasagna provides additional energy. The side-scrolling action only takes up one third of the screen and the entire game can be finished in five minutes.</p>",

Garfield can be moved at the bottom of the screen while the space on top of him is gradually filled with colored bubbles. Garfield needs to rearrange these into groups of three of the same colour (vertically) to make them disappear. Up to four bubbles of a single colour can be swallowed and then be relaunched.</p>\n<p>You can score additional points by causing chain reactions. If you leave certain bubbles unattended, they will change into uneatable coins. These can only be removed by an adjacent chain reaction, but you also need them these coins to move on to a next level. With each level, the speed and the amount of uneatable coins to be removed, is increased. If the bubbles reach the bottom of the screen or touch Garfield, the game is over.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Medieval Combat: Age of Glory</em> is a 2D fighting game. No background story is offered, just seven fantasy-styled characters going head-to-head. Despite the limitations of the platform, fighting is made easy. There is a key for a weak attack and one for a strong attack. By mixing these and repeatedly tapping them, you create combos, unique for each character. They can also jump, block, counterattack, and dash forward to grab the enemy. As you land punches, kicks and slashes, a magic meter at the bottom is filled. A quick tap when it's half full will launch a projectile. If you manage to fill it completely, you can charge a special move. The gameplay is then halted and you quickly have to press the key sequence displayed to unleash it. From a distance, you can taunt the opponent to drain his magic.</p>\n<p>The game modes include a tutorial, training, instant play, survival and arcade. In the arcade mode, you have to defeat all characters and take out Faust and Diablo. Based on the difficulty setting, they will be unlocked as playable upon completion. There are also a few bonus stages in between. The survival mode has you fight enemies one after another with a single health bar, and instant play provides quick matches. In the training mode, the moves can be practiced and you can command your AI opponent to perform specific actions such as attacking, blocking, crouching or jumping to recreate fighting scenes.</p>\n<p>The static backgrounds include castles, cities, churches and graveyards. The characters are rather large and the costumes are interactive. By delivering heavy blows, you can peel away armor, chest plates and helmets, leaving opponents vulnerable. After each fight, you are graded based on the amount of health left, the time needed, a perfect fight and bonus points for combos. After winning consecutive fights, you also receive a ranking with improved statistics during battles. The game has full sound and music, alternate costumes for each character, and includes a high scores screen.</p>",

There are tournaments for cash, with a bet before and a trick challenge after each match, versus matches for up to two players, challenges, and quick games against an AI-controlled opponent.</p>\n<p>For each shot, you have to rotate the cue into the right direction. Short lines show the general direction the balls will be moving. You then determine the power by timely pressing a key. Advanced controls let you perform jump shots, mass\u00e9 shots or add effect by repositioning the tip of the cue in relation to the ball. The colour of the cue can be selected at random, and upon progressing in the tournament, you unlock new characters.</p>\n<p>The game's theme music is an electronic version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Lynyrd+Skynyrd\">Lynyrd Skynyrd's</a> <em>Sweet Home Alabama</em>.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Poker comes to mobile phones in Gameloft's classy Midnight series, using the popular Texas Hold'em rules. Shown through a 3rd-person perspective (multiple players) or 1st-person (head-to-head), you can either play instant games to practice, go heads-up, or enter a career mode. Typical of the Midnight series, there is interaction with the opponents, and they all have a drawn portrait and a certain attitude.</p>\n<p>After winning a few games, you can move on to the career mode with buy-in tables, and if you keep winning you can access tables with bigger blinds and bets. The action keeps going clockwise and you keep track of other players' funds. When it's your turn, a menu in the top left corner pops up where you can decide to call, raise, fold, check, bet or go all-in. Following the rules, dealer responsibilities are also passed around, and there is even a little cheat built in. As a dealer, you can try to take a peek at the cards.</p>\n<p>The game optionally includes the odds shown in the bottom left corner, and a host who introduces the table and comments on the game. The theme music is Average White Band's <em>Pick Up the Pieces</em>.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The mobile platform is the only one to have a game based on the third <em>Mission: Impossible</em> film. It is loosely inspired by it and consists of two types of gameplay comprising ten levels in total. You have infiltration missions where you play as operative Ethan Hunt or Luther. In these platform levels, you have to rescue a hostage, find a lost PDA, gain entrance to a secret lab and take out a boss. You can engage enemies either with typical firearms such as a submachine gun, shotgun, rifle, grenade launcher or stun gun, or use a stealth approach to knock them out. New combat moves are unlocked as you progress. While playing, an adrenaline bar fills up and once fully loaded you can unleash a blitz attack. Pick-ups include ammo and health. You also need to avoid robots and get past laser defenses.</p>\n<p>Some time-limited mini-games are introduced during these levels. You have to guess a password, construct the features of guards for face recognition devices and wire electric circuits. Some parts of the background are interactive and you shoot canister and barrels to clear an area with a single bullet. After completing a mission, new difficulty levels or combat moves are unlocked. The game is autosaved at checkpoints to continue when you die.</p>\n<p>The second type of gameplay is a vertical-scrolling helicopter shoot-em-up. These missions require you to destroy enemies in the air and on the ground. There are pick-ups that provide new weapons or repair your helicopter, and you can collect a limited amount of megabombs that wipe out everything on the screen.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Lumines Mobile</em> is an adaptation of the PSP launch title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/17231/lumines-puzzle-fusion/\">Lumines: Puzzle Fusion</a>. In this puzzle game, you arrange coloured blocks, falling down, on a board to form squares of a single colour. A timeline crosses the screen from left to right and when it hits the side, all combinations created are removed and exchanged for points. As you progress, new features and bonuses are added, such as additional colours, bombs, avatars and new shapes. You can also unlock new game modes and new skins. The music adapts to your actions and playing style, and the background is animated based on it. Each level (referred to as a skin) has different music and a unique background.</p>\n<p>There are different game modes to choose from:<em> </em>Instant play*: play the last level unlocked in the arcade mode as a single game.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Arcade mode</em>: play levels with different backdrops to unlock new features and skins. While playing, combos slowly fill up a progress bar that, once completed, allows you to move on to a next level. In between regular board games, you face bosses in vertical split-screen battles. You have to create more combos per turn to remove playing space from the opponent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Challenge mode</em>: the original free Lumines mode where you play until you are stuck.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>VS CPU mode</em>: a single game similar to the boss games in the arcade mode.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Single skin mode</em>: play a single level.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Time attack mode</em>: destroy as many blocks as possible before time runs out.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Puzzle mode</em>: create a combo in the shape shown on the screen.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Shuffle mode</em>: once unlocked, this selects a random skin to play.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

You control Furrito, who lives with his fellow Furridos, reminiscent of squirrels, on an island. When they play with mysterious stars, an ancient snake god is awoken. All Furridos are locked up, except for you. By collecting stars and defeating enemies, you can free your friends.</p>\n<p>Furrido can roll into four directions to find stars. Blue stars add to your time, which, upon running out, ends the game, yellow ones provide more time, and the rare purple ones open up bonus levels. The courses are tricky, with obstacles, loops, hills, ramps, rails, small paths, flaming pits, platforms and moving barrels. You can use the dash button to attack enemies, such as bats, snakes and crabs. When you fall over the edge, you can continue right away. In the bonus levels, you can fly, float or surf. The game comes with a short tutorial that introduces different key layouts to control Furrito.</p>\n<p>There are nine levels, divided over the themes Rain Forest, Pearl Beach and Lost Temple, two bonus levels and a final boss.</p>",

One day, the planet is sneakily attacked by aliens and the first raids, supported by superior weapons, wipe out most of the defense structures. Reinforcements are on the way, but will likely be too late. As one of the survivors, you have to locate three human databases. These contain valuable information on all of mankind, as well as the coordinates of other inhabited systems. You have to travel through eight levels to destroy them all.</p>\n<p>The game offers four weapons and six enemy types. You can collect items such as ammo, medikits, and keycards to open locked doors. The player can move in all directions, and quick turning as well as strafing is supported.

        "description": "<p><em>Rabbitator</em> is a fast-paced puzzle game played on a 7x7 grid of tiles using an isometric perspective. It seems the developer was undecided about the storyline, because there are two. In the first version, you play as professor Nick Ibble who wants to control the carrot black market. Disguised as Rabbitator, you need to mark fields to claim them as your own, while avoiding the sentinels sent out by the big carrot syndicates. In the second storyline, you are a cadet of the military academy and you have to disguise yourself as a rabbit in a secret mission to halt the terrorists and plant a carrot plantation.</p>\n<p>At any rate, in each level you have to jump on all tiles to claim them. The colour will change and when all tiles are yours, you move on to the next level. There are some holes in the grid, you can fall off the edge, objects are dropped from the sky and there are moving enemies on the board. At certain intervals, you can pick up a carrot to immobilize the enemies and take them out <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/64335/pac-man/\">Pac Man</a>-style.</p>\n<p>There are twenty levels with increasing difficulty and a different type of gameplay. In the first four levels, you simply have to hop on each cell to claim it and end the level. In the next four levels, you first paint tiles in a transitional colour and then in a definite colour. Level 9 to 12 restricts your movement, as stepping on the same cell twice returns the initial colour. The final four levels combine transitional colours along with the restriction of the third set of levels. Different kinds of monsters try to sabotage you, such as toilet pans, snowmen, teeth, bombs, boots, sharks, aliens, and the grim reaper.</p>",

The engine, tires and nitro can be upgraded three times.</p>\n<p>The game is shown through an isometric perspective, with very direct controls.

The car selection includes 116i, 120i and 120d, but the first is the only one available right away. You have to complete the training sessions (time attack, with a ghost car of your best time) to unlock them. You can also pick a colour for your car, but you will only notice this as a coloured dot on a vertical line showing the cars' positions during races, as no external view is available.</p>\n<p>In the main competition mode you have to beat AI-controlled cars to unlock new circuits. Not a single course requires you to brake - go full speed with a little steering. The main challenge is to avoid your opponents who try to block you off. The game incorporates BMW's Dynamic Stability Control (DSC). When travelling too fast or when turning at a high speed, DSC steps in to restore tracking and traction. This is shown through a yellow symbol in the bottom right corner. High scores can be saved on the phone or uploaded to a ranking list at the BMW site.</p>",

They were also her servants and guardians, and now the forest has been intruded by strange creatures. The rainforest is dying, and Akhuna revives a single gulo to collect fruits and rid the forest of the intruders.</p>\n<p><em>Gulo's Tale</em> is an anime-styled side-scrolling platform game. Playing as Gulo, you have to complete levels by gathering the indicated amount of fruits. Levels are accessed through a world map, and statues of your fellow gulos provide the missions. After a completed mission, the statue turns from blue to red and you can continue. Gulo can only jump and create bubbles. These can be picked up and thrown at enemies - an alternate way of killing them next to a jump from above - or serve as temporary platforms. They only last a little while, so you have to be quickly. There are different settings and you can pick up power-ups that grant invincibility. Beat your best times in the time attack mode and unlock hidden levels.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The 2006 edition in the Derek Jeter Pro Baseball series polishes the game and introduces some new features such as manual fielding, power play, and more control over the pitcher and hitter. You can now charge your swing and decide on the direction you want to hit. Although New York Yankees's captain <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/81824/derek-jeter/\">Derek Jeter</a> is licensed, there is no full MLB license and all the players' names have been made up and assigned to cities.</p>\n<p>Fielding and baserunning is controlled through keys (manual), but you can also let the computer control it (auto), or interfere when you want to take over the AI-controlled actions (semi). The same keys are used to pick off stealers and you can map positions to numbers, according to the bases, to quickly advance players. In defense, you can control the players in eight directions and jump or dive for the ball.</p>\n<p>The main modes include quick play, exhibition matches, a full season of 29 or 58 games, and playoffs. Tweaks include different difficulty levels and the number of innings. During a season, you can simulate matches to advance more quickly. A small amount of team management is offered, you can select the line-up and decide on the pitchers' rotation. Another novelty is the Homerun Derby, where you can participate in a homerun contest with different rounds. The game's theme song is <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/243472/gary-glitter/\">Gary Glitter's</a> <em>Rock &amp; Roll Part 2</em>.</p>",

There are five teams available: pro players, vampires, Shaolin monks, punk and granddads, each with different characteristics. Rules are rather loosely incorporated - the ball cannot go out during the games, and there are no faults, cards or other restrictions. Players can move in eight directions and there are only two buttons. When attacking, you can pass and shoot (charge for a more powerful shot) and in defense you can switch players and tackle.</p>\n<p>Next to single matches and a penalty mode, you can participate in a tournament where, after preliminary matches, the two best teams go head to head in a final. There are three trophies to be won, based on the difficulty level, and you can choose to make matches last 2, 4 or 6 minutes.</p>",

You play as Hugo, standing on a stone in the middle of a river. You need to catch fish with your net. The net can be held at three different heights, on either side, and you can guess the correct action by watching the fishes' movement and colour. The net can only hold a maximum of five fish, so you need to empty it regularily. If you miss a fish, it will knock you off the stone and you lose a life. At times, other animals such as birds and insects appear - you need to avoid these. Hugo only has three lives and there is only one backdrop. As you progress, fish appears more quickly.</p>",

        "description": "<p>I-Play released two games based on <em>The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift</em> movie license at the same time. Next to the 3d version, they also made this classic top-down racer in 2d. The story mode has hardly got a story at all: you need to travel to 7 Tokyo districts. After beating the area master at one location, you move on to the next. Each location consists of three sessions: The Call where you race for the first place against three AI-controlled cars, Show Off where you need to impress with drifts to gain enough respect to attract the attention of the area master, and Twin Battle where you need to beat the area master and gain more respect than him.</p>\n<p>Show Off and Twin Battle require you to drift through corners. By skidding, a yellow meter in the top right corner is filled up. Once the meter is full, one of the seven boxes is filled and the meter is reset. If you manage to activate all yellow boxes, you move on to a set of green ones, a minimum requirement to get access to Twin Battles. Chain drifting also provides cash, and you gain more respect when you drift for a long time and at a high speed, while collisions deduct from your score.</p>\n<p>After winning races, you can upgrade your car, with enhancements for acceleration, speed, brakes, tires and nitro. In the body shop, you can up your respect with a paint job, rear spoilers, decals and air scoops. The other game modes are Quick Race and Solo Runs. Solo Runs offers three additional race types: Survival Run where you constantly need to keep drifting to make your respect last, Last Man Standing (the last one after each round is out) and Time Trial.</p>",

The Gaul village of the heroes, the last stand against the Roman empire, is attack by Vikings. They kidnap Justforkix, the nephew of chief Vitalstatistix. Through 3 worlds with 12, you have to guide Asterix to rescue him.</p>\n<p>It is a rather straightforward platformer. Asterix can move, jump, crouch and hit enemies with his trademark uppercut. During the journey you collect skulls, stones and helmets, defeat Vikings, do some jumping, and push items to create temporary platforms. You have three lives, but health can be restored with hearts and additional lives can be collected. When you discover a potion, Asterix moves twice as fast and is invincible for 3 seconds. Certain objects can be broken to reveal hidden items.</p>",

Next to training matches, there is also a eurocup with nine locations, but there is in fact only one venue and only one opponent.

        "description": "<p><em>Neopets Mobile</em> is not a standalone game, but an extension of the online community neopets.com, where you can create or adopt a pet, and then look after it. This game allows you to continue playing through your cellphone when you are not behind your computer, making it the first full W2W (Wireless-to-Web) application.</p>\n<p>The pets need to be fed and you can buy, trade or sell items. By downloading your pet data on your mobile, you can continue playing. The game is shown on a small part of Neopia, the world where Neopets live - a location you cannot access from the web. This location is Lutari Island where inhabitants all wear beautiful colors. On Lutari you still have access to shops, bank, training school, Bog of Charity and a lot of other locations that allow you to buy all the items your neopet will need to live correctly.</p>\n<p>Along with the application, 2 mini-games are included, providing neopoints needed to buy items. The first, Lutari Race, is a jump-and-run game where you need to avoid objects and collect bonuses. The second, Blockstravaganza, is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Bejeweled\">Bejeweled</a> clone. Depending on your performances you will earn more or less neopoints.</p>\n<p>All users carry an empty Lutari talisman. By visiting certain pages on the site, you can collect beads for it. Neopets Mobile extends this feature by providing beads if you refer other users to this mobile version.</p>",

Although the game is fully-licensed, it does not have the extensive amount of teams and players the console versions offer. Only national teams are available and there are no leagues with specific clubs.</p>\n<p>The game improves over the 2005 edition with new gameplay modes, a few cutscenes, and more teams to choose from. The main game modes are Tutorial, Quick Match, Friendly, Cup, Scenario and Shoot Out. The new Scenario mode offers specific tasks at the end of a season, such as finishing first in a league, finishing above a red line to keep the fans loyal, or saving a team from relegation.</p>\n<p>Before each match, you can define the line-up, formation and strategy. During the game, you can introduce substitutions or view statistics. While playing, the players can be controlled in eight directions, and there are keys to pass, change the active player, tackle, and shoot. The amount of time you keep a key pressed defines the power, length, of the type of shot. This allows for specific moves such as lobs, cross passes, headers, through passes and clearance kicks.</p>",

Unlike its sequel, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/24755/metal-slug-mobile-impact/\">Metal Slug: Mobile Impact</a>, the art, weapons and gameplay are only loosely based on the original game. You control the hero Marco Rossi through eight side-scrolling levels where you need to take out enemies and free prisoners of war. There are new weapons and upgrades, and unlike the original game, you do not die after a single hit as there is a health meter. There is no multi-directional firing either, you can only shoot in two directions, with an additional key to shoot upwards.</p>\n<p>Items you can collect include bonus items for points, health kits and weapon upgrades. A few missions also give the opportunity to drive a tank and to fly a jet. You do not need to rotate the tank's gun yourself, it automatically aims for targets. Most of the missions take place against a city or a jungle backdrop.</p>",

The gameplay is identical to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=1805:+French+Empire\">1805: French Empire</a> but this game is set during World War II with relevant units and terrain. The singleplayer mode consists of a campaign with eight consecutive missions. Enemies need to be taken out, specific units need to be escorted, villages are captured and messengers are ambushed. The player and the computer opponent take turns with actions on the battlefield.</p>\n<p>The army consists of tanks, transporters and infantry. The opponent has tanks, jeeps and antitank units. Each phase, units can be moved and they attack when an opponent is in range. The outcome is determined by the unit type and the terrain. Rushing tactics do not work, the moves need to be planned and the terrain can be put to an advantage, for instance by attacking from a height. Slower units such as infantry can board a transporter to move around more quickly. Many missions start with scattered units on different sides of the map. There is no building or resource management involved, all missions need to be completed with the units available at the start.</p>\n<p>The units' health is shown through coloured bars, along with the amount of hexagons they can move. Navigate can also be done through a mini-map in the top right corner. The missions are introduced through a short briefing and after each round a statistics screen is shown. Two players can battle on a single device in the multiplayer <em>hothand</em> mode. There are four scenarios on larger maps available and all types of units are available right away in this mode.</p>",

You only have one weapon, but by picking up the M, H and P icons enemies leave behind, you receive additional firepower through small rockets. These either travel over the ground or ceiling, or seek a moving target. You need to move quickly, as there is only a limited amount of oxygen at your disposal, and only few enemies leave behind refills. The jet pack allows you to travel faster, but you need to come down regularly to recharge it. In difficult situations, you can charge your gun for a long, powerful blast.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Da Vinci Code: Light Puzzle</em> is the first of four mobile games based on the movie based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dan+Brown\">Dan Brown's</a> novel. The game takes place in the Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland, where Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveau are searching for hidden messages in the walls.</p>\n<p>To find these messages, you have to direct the light coming from the windows of the chapel into coloured crystals. This is done by placing mirrors around the room to reflect the light. For each puzzle that is completed you will be given a letter, used to uncover the hidden messages. The further you get in the game the more object you will have to handle. In addition to normal mirrors you have double-sided mirrors that can direct two light beams at the same spot, and devices that can split the light into multiple beams. You can also bend and recolour the beam using prisms, lenses and other devices that will be available as the game progresses. Each puzzle must completed within a set number of moves before the sun sets.</p>",

Everything but the first missions are locked, and you have to complete them to unlock the later ones, eventually unlocking the next year as soon as you finish every mission in the earlier one.</p>\n<p>The missions can vary wildly, from location to objective and weapons. In some missions you have a team of soldiers to help you out, in others you have to work solo. You'll be instructed along the mission on what to do, as well as receiving hints and tips on how to do it. You may have to take down enemy troops, call in airstrikes, hide from bomber attacks, destroy enemy vehicles or even be left all alone sniping enemy units. The time you take to beat the mission is stored so you can try to beat the default \"best time\" or your own best time.</p>\n<p>The game works in a pseudo top-down view, since the game works like a 2D top-down but the scenario is rather 3D. Most of the maps are similar, having you start on the bottom and having to make your way up to the top to progress through the mission. You can crawl under sandbags or hide behind buildings for cover, and sometimes there's medics spread around to assist you. The weapons are varied, from pistols, machine guns, sniper, bazooka or even a walkie-talkie to call in airstrikes. Most of the weapons simply fire forward, but to help you aim, some can \"auto-point\" at nearby targets, and others have a reticule that you move around with the D-Pad.</p>",

Unlike the console versions of the game with the 1st-person hunting gameplay, the mobile <em>Rayman Raving Rabbids</em> is a traditional side-scrolling platformer. In the past, Rayman's world was filled with cute, cuddly rabbids. They were constantly victimised by the other species, however, and suddenly vanished from the planet. Decades later, they resurface as psychotic creatures with a vengeance. Only Rayman can save the world from these mad bunnies.</p>\n<p>You control Rayman through eight levels based on three environments, based on the themes forest, beach and the rabbid's HQ. The enemies are designed to fit the atmosphere. Initially, Rayman is only armed with his fist, but he can pick up weapons such as the plunger gun and air pump gun. He can also do <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Sonic+the+Hedgehog\">Sonic-like</a> rolls, swing on poles, do wallruns, bungee-jumps and kung-fu moves. The gameplay is fast and you can ride creatures such as pigs for transportation. Level bosses make a regular appearance.</p>",

It offers three game modes and six girls (with a different difficulty level) to play against. Initially, only one mode and one girl is available, the others need to be unlocked. You can practise in quick game or go for full games. The game types are regular poker, blackjack and video poker where all regular rules apply. In the Video poker variant, 5 cards are dealt and you only swap your cards once. Based on the value of that hand, you are awarded cash, without raising, folding or calling.</p>\n<p>Advancing is based on cash. You only need to complete one game type against a girl to win the level. If you do well and drive a girl into debt, she starts betting pieces of clothing in exchange for cash. If you manage to win consecutive games, the girls win back their clothes until you run out of cash. Relieving a girl of clothes happens in four stages, and a certain area is blurred out if you managed to completely reveal an opponent. If you move on to the next level, the girl is added to a gallery where you can undress or clothe her in different phases. The theme music is a digitized version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/493409/donna-summer/\">Donna Summer's</a> <em>Hot Stuff</em>.</p>",

Challenge them in a game of regular poker, blackjack or video poker to drive them into debt and make them cash their clothes. Not all opponents and modes are available right away, they need to be unlocked gradually. After beating a girl, she is added to the gallery where you can view the undressing process.</p>\n<p>One of the small gameplay changes includes higher initial bets (up to $100). The girls are also less revealing: frontal nudity is covered by small stars and the full monty cannot be achieved.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Asphalt 3: Street Rules</em> is an over-the-top mobile arcade racer sharing gameplay elements with the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Need+for+Speed\">Need for Speed</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Burnout\">Burnout</a> games. The game offers races in seven major cities with 12 licensed cars and bikes, including the Pagani Zonda F, Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder, Kawasaki ZX10 R and others.</p>\n<p>Each city offers 4 challenges out of 5 modes: regular races, beat 'em all (destroy as many opponents as possible), cop chase (chase a bunch of racers as a cop and take out the leader), duel (place a bet and beat a single opponent) and cash attack (make as much cash as you can). The tracks are filled with obstacles and traffic. By performing illegal acts such as power sliding, crashing through roadblocks, speeding or wiping out opponents' cars, or collecting bonuses, you earn boosts. If you have a sufficient amount, you can even use up to two boosts at the same time, often a requirement to break through obstacles or take out other cars. Illegal acts raise your wanted level and you will be chased by patrol cars and helicopters. If your driving becomes really outrageous, you even appear on live news feeds.</p>\n<p>By winning races, you earn new cars, girls who cheer for you, and tuning parts. Unlike common practice, you do not need to pay for cars or parts, they are available right away once unlocked. The different tuning parts include the car colour, tyres, cubic capacity, cylinders, piston, vinyls, rims, engine, air filters, weight modifiers, exhaust, brakes, transmission, shock absorbers, ECU and crankshift. New races and cities are unlocked if you earn a sufficient amount of cash.</p>\n<p>The game's theme song is a digitized version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Nick+Roubanis\">Nick Roubanis'</a> Misirlou.</p>",

The Scarab of Salitis has been stolen from an Egyptian pyramid and the girls have to retrieve it. That first mission will then take them to Himalayan Mountains and finally a space station - 8 levels in total.</p>\n<p>Based on the French animation series of the same name, the player controls one of the 3 girls through side-scrolling platforms environments. Based on the phones' screen sizes, there are 3 versions and they differ in moves, the amount of levels and certain features. Gameplay consists of avoiding obstacles, timing jumps to platforms and fighting enemies. Enemies can be taken out from behind, using objects in the environment, or by a series of fighting combos. Using gadgets provided by their boss Joey, they can swing over holes, pull levers from a distance, or use a jet pack. Two levels have the player only fly a jet pack, while being chased and avoiding obstacles.</p>\n<p>During the levels, the story is further explained through small in-game cutscenes. The beginning of the game also serves as the tutorial, where the various possibilities are gradually explained.</p>",

You control a twentysomething dropped in New York with a 40-day lease. During this short period, you have to make a career, meet new people and engage in social activities. After creating a character, you can distribute 20 points over beauty, health, humor and culture; the four main statistics that define a character throughout the game.</p>\n<p>There is only a limited amount of time in a day, so actions have to be chosen wisely. By visiting locations such as a sports club, a theater, a style salon, or a club, you can choose which aspects of your personality you want to improve. You also need to eat, sleep and wash up regularly. New people are saved in your cell phone. You can work on your friendship levels with regular talks, gossip, jokes, presents and flirting. Each character has specific interests and the outcome of your choices influences the levels. Friends can introduce you to jobs, where you have to complete mini-games to earn money.</p>\n<p>The main storyline follows a quest-based approach. After meeting a few people, you can decide to pursue love. To attract someone's attention, you have to date, buy presents and raise certain levels of your character to impress your future lover, e.g. culture by going to a concert, humor by playing video games (?).</p>\n<p>The game is shown through an isometric perspective and you can move around freely. While talking, different topics appear as a circle around your character. New locations are visited through a map. Your cash balance, the time of the day, and the cell phone where friends, quests and messages are stored, are all shown in the corners of the screen.</p>",

In this <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=The+Sims\">Sims</a>/dating game using an isometric perspective, you guide one of the series' protagonists - Ryan, Seth, Marissa or Summer - through their lives in Orange County, California. Each character has a unique look and characteristics based on style, maturity, intelligence and attitude. The aim of the game is to keep your friends happy as well as taking care of daily tasks.</p>\n<p>All important information is stored in your cell phone. Friends call you to schedule meetings, you can view your current objectives, statistics and schedules, go through your inventory, or call to get to know a friend's current location. Basic quests include raising your four main characteristics, performing tasks for your friends, earning money, and buying specific items. There are also a few relationships to pursue, as there are many characters in town. Through an overview map, you can visit the student's lounge, rooms of friends, shops, etc. To raise your statistics, you can train with a punch bag, tutor another student, work in a diner to earn money, play video games, watch television, or go shopping.</p>\n<p>You can talk to other characters, apologize or offend them, joke, or offer gifts. When a romantic relationship is introduced, it also becomes possible to perform more intimate actions. Conversations, as well as all other main activities, are presented as mini-games, somewhat reminiscent of those in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/15118/leisure-suit-larry-magna-cum-laude/\">Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude</a>. There are memory games, top-down driving sequences, games of catch, and even the classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Asteroids\">Asteroids</a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dungeons of Despair</em> is an isometric RPG game where the player can explore a multitude of levels with many different types of monsters to face and slay, numerous quests to undertake, and an item generation system that allows for thousands of items with different magical attributes.</p>\n<p>The two versions (Gold for Nokia s60/equivalent and Lite for s40/equivalent) differ slightly in the number of levels and the design of the levels. The Gold version offers extra quests and a few extra types of items, but the core engine remains the same for both, along with all the attributes and player stats.</p>\n<p>The gold version has over 60 levels and numerous secret areas - some of which can be found by chancing upon scrolls showing their entrances. The Lite version has just over 20 main levels and 1 secret area. </p>\n<p>As well as basic attributes such as health, strength, defence, and dexterity, there are numerous other attributes such as luck, life-leech, regeneration, damage returned (to an attacker), stun... as well as damage modifiers. The player also has weapon proficiencies which improve the more the player uses a particular weapon. Daggers deal low damage but provide very quick attacks - useful if you have a good chance of stunning an opponent every successful attack. On the other end of the scale, two-handed weapons provide large damage but with a much slower attack rate. These can be particularly useful if you have a good life-leeching rate. Single handed weapons allow you to carry a shield which dramatically increases your chance to parry an attack.</p>\n<p>The multitude of weapons, modifiers and items in the game allow the player to complete the game in a manner that suits them and provides several different playing strategies.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Nedime - The Caliph's Daughter</em> is the first part of The Dark Eye (TDE) mobile fantasy RPG series. Your first action will be to create a new hero choosing from a variation of 14 original classes based on the Pen&amp;Paper (P&amp;P) RPG. You can then customize your heroes' stats and abilities in classic role-playing fashion by assigning points to create new strengths or compensate weaknesses. Once done you have the option to save your hero and even transfer it to any of the sequels, taking over any earned experience and improving your odds of success.</p>\n<p>Throughout the story you are presented with multiple choice decisions. Some of them will require good intuition, others dice-rolling based on your heroes' stats. Fights are handled very similar. All of this is based on the TDE 20 sided dice system (not to be confused with D&amp;D D20).</p>\n<p>The game story is based on Aventuria, a Continent in the world of Dere, where swords and magic have created many different cultures and races. Unlike most common medieval RPGs, Aventuria has made quite a number of cultural and social advancements which place it more into the region of a magic enlightened Renaissance. The original German P&amp;P RPG, consisting of hundreds of books and novels, has been brought over by the original authors of some TDE publications.</p>\n<p>This adventure takes you right into the mysterious palace of sultan Hasrabal, who has abducted and imprisoned the beautiful daughter of the Caliph. It is up to you to help Nedime in her time of dire need.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Lucky Luke: Outlaws</em> is a first-person side-scrolling shooter based on the famous comics series about the poor lonesome cowboy who can draw a gun faster than his shadow: Lucky Luke. The Dalton brothers have escaped from their prison, along with numerous bandits, and Lucky Luke suspects they are involved with the missing gold of an Austin-bound train. After discovering the convoy, they also kidnap the bank's daughter.</p>\n<p>The game is started with a number of life points according to one of three difficulty levels, and a colt with a limited number of bullets. The cowboy has to disarm his opponents by moving a cross-hair shaped cursor over the screen and firing at the right time. Four flashing arrows indicate where to find the opponents. If it takes too long, a timer starts and when the countdown is complete, Lucky Luke loses a life.</p>\n<p>When beating an opponent, Lucky Luke sometimes recovers money or additional bullets, along with points added to the score. If an opponent isn't found in time, Lucky Luke can dodge the incoming shot by pressing a key. On a succesful dodging attempt, the cowboy must then find the shooter to disarm him and attack the next opponent. Some enemies also have hostages who cannot be fired at. The five levels hold bonuses hidden in the scenery. Next to cash and bullets, these include stars (life points) and horseshoes (+2 seconds for Luke to protect himself). The final stage ends with a battle against the Dalton brothers.</p>",

There are three background settings available: desert, canyon and outdoor, providing three different tracks in total. Player can either try to beat the tracks in the Grand Prix mode, against three computer-controlled players, or beat the best times on their own in the Time Trial mode. While racing, there are power-ups to collect, such as turbo to increase the speed, chewing gum to make the other karts get stuck, and an egg to throw to slow another car down. Players can choose from 5 characters: Moorhuhn, Lesshuhn, Moorfrosh, Pumpkin and Schneemann.</p>",

Damage taken can be repaired between stages, but you've got a limited amount of time you can spend in the service area each time so you may not be able to repair everything if you take too much damage. The game includes various modes of play (including an option to race against a ghost of a previous lap), and weather effects on some of the tracks.</p>",

In this instance, the game on offer is obviously pool. UK 8-ball pool is played (the balls coloured red and yellow, not spots and stripes as would be expected in US 8-ball) and the player can play hot-seat against another human opponent on the one handset, or against 1 of 3 difficulty-levels of AI opponent. Barman Terry referees the match whilst other locals pop up occasionally to comment on particularly good or bad shots.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>2005 Real Football/Soccer</em> is the second game in the series and the perspective was changed into an isometric view. The game is once again fully licensed and offers different game modes: Quick Play, Exhibition, Cup, League and Training. Contrary to the previous games, a few famous clubs such as Liverpool and AC Milan are now also available, next to the national teams.</p>\n<p>The core gameplay remains: three buttons for actions such as tackles, passes and shots, but now with the addition of a power meter for the players, which can be maxed out after successful actions. Other novelties include crosses, actions in the air, a double tap on a movement key to sprint, and player-controlled movement for the keeper during penalties. Prior to a game, the player can set the formation and change the positions. The players still have individual skills based on four settings.</p>\n<p>After winning cups, the players can collect trophies stored in a gallery. There is also a small mini-game when a streaker enters the pitch. He needs to outrun the stewards and get as close to the players as possible.</p>",

The game uses pieces with a white and a dark face, representing the two players' colours. Players lay pieces on the board alternately, one stone at a time. Every piece has to be put at a place where it touches the opponent's stone row of any length, while there is a player's stone at the of the row. All captured stones in between can then be reversed and become the player's colour. The only limitation is that the entire row needs to be of a single colour and without free spaces. When all pieces are used, the players with more pieces of his colour on the board is the winner.</p>\n<p><em>3D Othello Deluxe</em> uses a 3D engine to show the game. As more pieces appear on the board, the camera gradually zooms out to give a better overview. There are 3 levels of difficulty and two human players can compete against each other (hot seat).</p>",

There are 8 different weapons to collect, including grenades, a Kalashnikov, a shotgun, a flamethrower, an Inca artifact... Additional ammo, armor and health is scattered around the levels. The 7 enemy types include mutants, insects, flying wasps and pterodactyls, and two bosses. While playing, dialogue screens appear to develop the plot.</p>",

The aim of the game is to select groups of two or more blocks of the same color (horizontal of vertical) from a board to clear it. Next to the Normal mode where an entire screen needs to be cleared, this version adds a Chaos mode. In this time-sensitive mode, only half of the screen is filled with blocks, but new lines are added at regular intervals. When the lines reach the top of the screen, the game is over. There is also a bomb item in this mode - clicking it removes 6 adjacent blocks. Next to the new game mode, the graphics have also been improved.</p>",

For each match you and your opponent have three lives, so when you have won three matches you can move on to the next match in the tournament. A couple of power-ups also exist. Using them, you can increase your speed, go through walls or launch a missile towards your opponent. The game is entirely in 3D, and uses the same graphical design as the movie and its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10153/tron-20/\">PC game sequel</a>.</p>",

Certain actions can be linked in two combos. There are also weapons to be picked up, such as knives and bats, and barrels can be grabbed and thrown at incoming enemies.</p>\n<p>There are three time-limited levels, with sprites and backdrops taken from other games in the series, with a boss at the end, and also a few minor jumping sequences.

        "description": "<p><em>Dribble</em> is a simple football game where the player has to dribble past four defenders to reach the goal. The perspective then switches to first-person and two axes appear on the screen, to define the direction of your shot. The last step requires the player to choose the power of the kick. Based on the selection, a goal is scored, the keeper saves the ball or the shot goes over. The game then continuously loops the same process and keeps track of the amount of goals scored. A single session consists of 180 seconds.</p>",

With 60 puzzles set in 4 environments: Rapa Nui Island, India, Aztecs ruins and Egypt, the player needs to find a solution to make all the bricks in a scene topple. Borrowing elements from games such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=The+Incredible+Machine\">The Incredible Machine</a>, using springs, dynamite, springboards and cannons, the player only has a limited amount of moves during each puzzle.</p>\n<p>To solve a puzzle, all bricks need to topple and the green one last. There are special bricks that introduce a lot of strategy, such as solid bricks, rolling bricks, bricks that are divided and go separate ways and delayed bricks. Each puzzle is time-limited but there are keys to add more time. Gus O'Line can pick up certain bricks and move them to another location, indicated by a blinking white square. To try the puzzle, the dragon breathes fire and makes the first brick topple. Puzzles become increasingly difficult, but there is an unlimited amount of tries. There is a key to toggle a dynamic camera to follow the action, a key to undo the last move, and a Help GUI to show the function of the different bricks.</p>",

As with other street sports games, <em>Underground Street Soccer</em> goes for a more arcade-oriented recreation of the sport. Doing tricks is therefore an important part of the game. When doing tricks your freestyle bar will be filled. When the freestyle bar has been filled, you can do a freestyle move. To perform a freestyle move you have to press certain buttons at certain time intervals.</p>\n<p>Three game modes are available. We have free match, where you play a single match with teams of your choice on one of the locations in the game, ranging from Brazil to France to Japan. Then we have the My Street mode, where you get to create your own team with your own players, and then play in a tournament against other teams from all over the world. After good performances you will be able to upgrade your team.</p>\n<p>The third mode is the Challenge mode, where you have to duel against another player. This is done by doing tricks in the same way as you perform freestyle moves in the game. When succeeding you will gain momentum over your opponent, and when you have full momentum you win the duel.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Terminator Revenge</em> is an action platform game that takes place in 1984 A.D. where the Earth's military forces seized the remaining parts of the Terminator sent back by Skynet from the future to kill Sarah Connor, the mother of the future Earth resistance leader. Intelligence shows that these part were stolen by a band of environmental scientists in 1992, motivated by their result of the scenario analysis. The scientists believe that would this technology remain in wrong hands, it would ultimately lead to the annihilation of man kind. These scientists later joined John Connor and the resistance.</p>\n<p>In 2029 A.D. a war between man and machine has laid the world in ruin. Skynet has grown strong by now but is loosing the battle due to the research obtained by the resistance in the past. To prevent this, Skynet sends another Terminator back in the past to set the future back on track.</p>\n<p>The player controls this Terminator through platform stages where the goal is to find objects, weapon to progress and finish each level. There are doors to open, objects to collect and characters to kill to finish the game. The protagonist can also crouch and jump.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica television series, this game puts the player into the shoes of a rookie Viper pilot aboard the Galactica. Taking orders from Lt. Kara \"Starbuck\" Thrace, the player must fulfill a number of missions with varied objectives, ranging from dogfights with Cylon raiders to escort missions, search and rescue operations and more. Many missions are inspired by events from the series: defending the Galactica from incoming Cylon nukes, escorting Raptor scouts searching for water supplies, or shooting down civilian ships that have been taken over by Cylon agents.</p>\n<p>Many missions have optional secondary objectives like destroying a certain number of Cylons, completing the primary objective within a certain time limit or letting no harm come to an escorted ship.</p>\n<p>The Viper is equipped with a laser cannon, and can optionally carry seeking missiles. Various power-ups can be collected. Weapons upgrades improve speed or firing rate or increase the number of laser shots. Also available are speed boosts, energy refills and extra lives.</p>\n<p>While the action is always viewed from the top, the control scheme changes with the type of the mission. Many combat missions behave like traditional vertically-scrolling shoot'em'ups, while search and rescue missions allow the player to change speed and fly in every direction. Others allow a directional change between flying forward or backward in addition to left and right.</p>",

You take the role of John Rico, squad leader of Roughnecks, as you embark on planetary missions against the vicious aliens. Mission objectives very, ranging from seek-and-destroy missions to escort and rescue operations. Most of the time though, your goal is simply to blast the alien arachnids before they have a chance to get at you. </p>\n<p>Gameplay is top-down in the tradition of classic 2D shooters such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1618/commando/\">Commando</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/933/soldiers-of-fortune/\">The Chaos Engine</a>. Use the keypad on your mobile to point and shoot, thus fighting your way across the hostile terrain of the desolate Planet Halcyon. You can pick up ammo packs and medical supplies as you blast your way through the creepy-crawlies. There are many different weapons and items you can collect and use for your combat tactics -- including pheromone pods to lure the aliens into ambush, land mines, a cloaking device, and many more.</p>",

Therefore she flees the temple leaving Spyro behind.</p>\n<p>Spyro, in his efforts to find Cynder whilst trying to retrieve his powers, is ambushed by the Dreaded Apes, sworn arch enemies of the Dragons. As servants of the Dark Master and led by Gaul the evil Baboon King, they wreak havoc upon Spyro's efforts.</p>\n<p>Thankfully Sypro has The Chronicler, an ancient dragon to guide and support him in his quest to find Cynder and foil the Dark Master's plan. Failure would result in The Eternal Night. As Spyro, the player controls the dragon through platform-based levels based on flight, arcade combat and puzzle solving.</p>\n<p>There are some differences compared to the previous game. Firstly Spyro has new abilities as he has matured. He is now able to break walls and he has different fireballs acquired as he progresses through the game. These also affect enemies differently, particularly the bosses of which there are several new challenges in terms of how the players need to work how to defeat them. There are also new enemies, new triggers, traps and puzzles.</p>",

Suddenly, evil phantoms appear in Luki's world and kidnap all his friends, converting them to possessed creatures. The phantoms hate nothing more than the friendly and peaceful world Luki lives in. When Luki awakes, his world is left empty, and the only thing he can do now is to travel to the shadow realm and get his friends back from the phantoms.</p>\n<p>In Bubble Boost, you help Luki on his quest in the shadow realm. The game is a platformer, so Luki has to jump over gaps and avoid getting touched by the possessed creatures. As a defensive weapon, Luki can shoot Magic Bubbles, which come in four different varieties. The objective in each level is to get the key that opens the level exit, while at the same time getting a high score by collecting gems and freeing Luki's friends.</p>",

Spyro and Cynder will meet friends such has Ignitus the red dragon and Hunter the panther who will help them during their quest. </p>\n<p>This new episode of Spyro is mainly a platformer with a bit of exploration. There are also flying sequences which are played like Space Harrier. The game is story driven with a lot of scripted sequences inside the levels. Each dragon has 4 types of breath linked to specific elements (fire, poison, ice, etc...). They also can glide a bit in order to reach far platforms. This episode is the last one of the trilogy. Even if the name is similar to the last console game created by Etranges Libellules, the development was completely independent.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Hip Hop Immortals</em> is a mobile game in which wannabe Hip Hop stars begin their careers in beat-up apartments in the 1970s and, by earning points in the three included mini-games (MCing, Breakdancing, and Graffiti), rise to fame and fortune through the 80s, 90s and into the 00s. </p>\n<p>The MCing mini-game is the most unique of the three, consisting of a third-person view of the game's main character rapping in a setting corresponding to the character's success level and the current era of the game. The lyrics of the song scroll along the screen above the character's head, occasionally featuring blank spaces, which are filled by selecting an appropriate word using the d-pad's four direction buttons. The selection is then graded based upon speed of entry, rhyming, metre and (of course) whether the resulting lyric makes sense and points are assigned.</p>\n<p>The other two mini-games, Graffiti and Breakdancing, are a small four-screen platformer (graffiti artist at work, must evade security guards) and a head-to-head rhythm-action game against an AI dancer. </p>\n<p>The Graffiti mini-game features custom bitmap graffiti art created by famed artist Cope2 and Breakdancing is notable for its meticulous adherence strictly to moves and move combinations that can be performed in real life.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Pokermillion 2009 is a mobile poker game that features a large amount of different poker game types (including rarely-seen stuff like Pineapple Hold 'Em and Omaha Hi/Lo) as well as a film-noir-style storyline presented in a Frank Miller style graphic novel format. </p>\n<p>Omaha Hi/Lo is probably the most unique of the game types, and yields particularly eclectic results -- quite in line with its real-life performance. In this variant, the player is looking to hold both the highest and lowest possible hands, in combination with the board. </p>\n<p>The more standard four-card hold 'em variant Omaha is also included, as are big-pot bonanza Royal Hold 'Em, three-hole-card games Pineapple Hold 'Em, Crazy Pineapple and the strategically fascinating Tahoe Hold 'Em. In addition to playing any of these games in a one-off \"quick games\", it's also possible to set up multi-table tournaments that can last hours at a stretch, using any or all of the seven variants (and allowing a huge amount of other statistical variability, down to the prize structure and bet schedules of individual tables).</p>\n<p>Pokermillion 2009 also features a story mode. The narrative's twists and turns see the player (of user-selectable gender) searching for a missing poker pro brother who may have bitten off more than he can chew. A number of settings are available, from Monte Carlo to Afghanistan.</p>",

Good luck!</p>\n<p>The game plays like a fusion between <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pong\">Pong</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Breakout\">Breakout</a>, where the player is on the bottom of the screen and the opponent is at the top. In the space between the two paddle-like ships there's a number of blocks of various kinds which, while in the way, also randomly generate power-ups for either contestant.</p>\n<p>The player gets to select a ship before starting, and while they graphically are different, there is no actual difference between them in terms of gameplay. The championship itself takes place on all the continents of Earth, and the matches can be played in any order. The difficulty is different for all of them however, so picking the hardest first is only for the skilled player.</p>",

The game plays like the Atari arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/65163/lunar-lander/\">Lunar Lander</a>. The player takes control of a spaceship that he has to land safely without crashing. This is done by using the shuttle's thrusters to the left or the right to go to in the opposite direction. At the same time there's only a limited amount of fuel available so the player has to be careful not to use the thrusters to much. This remake offers ten levels each which is completed by landing the space shuttle at one of three platforms. Some platforms are harder to land on and therefore give more fuel and points. It's also possible to unlock the original Commodore version of the game by landing on an X-10 platform.</p>",

Just like in the PC game, the player gets to command the Able Company through some of the most important battles of the Normandy Campaign, from the D-Day landings to the last battles of the war. It does however differ in a number of ways, with a turn-based mechanic instead of real-time as one of the most important changes.</p>\n<p>Each mission starts with the player getting to customize his troop. Available unit types depend on the mission, but can include riflemen, snipers, machine gunners, bazookas as well as different kinds of tanks. The actual battle starts with a deploy mode where the player chooses the starting positions of his units. Once this is done it is time for the action where for each turn the player can issue a command to each unit. In addition to the common commands move and attack (which can also be executed at the same time) there are also commands for ambushing, suppressing fire, airstrikes and calling medics. </p>\n<p>In addition to the campaign there are two other game modes: random battle and skirmish battle. In skirmish the player can choose difficulty level, mission and army to play as. There is also a tutorial.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Alpha Snake</em> is a mash up of two different kinds of games: <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Snake+games\">snake</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Word+Construction+games\">word construction</a>. The player controls a snake from a top down perspective. The snake grows larger by eating, however in <em>Alpha Snake</em> the snake does not eat apples or other tasty fruits. Instead it eats letters. Here's where the word construction part comes in. Each level has letters from a nine-letter word and the snake has to eat them in order to create any correct word that can be formed out of the letters. For each word created the snake grows longer and the game gets harder. If the snake happens to eat the wrong letter (so that a word can't be created) it will get sick. To treat this sickness it has to find a red pill which vaporizes the last letter. There's also a green pill that makes the snake shrink.</p>",

In addition to normal movement options the player can also do barrel rolls that help avoid the enemy aircraft. The game features a cobra mode that can be entered at any time and makes the player invincible for a few seconds. The player can, in addition to normal bullets, use rockets in two different modes: simple and advanced. In simple mode the rockets explode at the first enemy encountered while the advanced mode lets the player choose a specific target. The player also has access to a couple of bombs. The enemy has rockets too and to avoid being hit, the player can use flares to attract the rockets away from his plane. At some occasions the player will come across quick time events where a number is displayed on the screen. To succeed with the event the player has to enter the number quickly.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Crazy Balls</em> is a puzzle game where the player has to navigate a number of balls through labyrinth-like levels. The game is viewed from a top-down perspective of the labyrinth and each level starts with the player having control of an orange ball that can be moved anywhere where there is space. There is also purple balls that are scattered throughout the levels and these will stick to the player's ball when touched. Due to thin passages of the labyrinth the more balls stuck together the harder it will be to navigate. In addition to moving his balls around, the player can rotate the balls clockwise to avoid getting stuck. The levels are designed so that the player often doesn't have enough space to rotate and therefore doing this at the right position is crucial for progressing through the levels. It's also important to consider how the balls are stuck together. A big block of balls won't fit through some of the narrow passages while having them all in a line might make it impossible to rotate them. A level is completed when all purple balls have been connected to the orange ball.</p>",

As in other match three games (like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/24362/bejeweled/\">Bejeweled</a>) the player is presented with a grid of tiles (here called tokens) that can be removed by making matches of three or more tiles of the same colour. What make this variant of the concept different is that the objective isn't just to remove the tokens but to move Spider-Man across the grid to a special destination. Each level has a path that Spider-Man follows. The path is hidden and is only revealed by swapping and removing tokens that are over the path. Spider-Man moves automatically when the path is revealed. Each level is time based and Spider-Man has to reach his destination before the timer runs out. </p>\n<p>The game features some special power up tokens that will help the player. For example there is the scramble tokens which shuffles all tokens on the grid, the spider-sense tokens that reveals the path temporarily and the rage tokens that can be used to plow through tokens blocking the path. In some levels Spider-Man will be chased by black goo and has to finish the levels before being catched.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Pixudoku</em> is a mobile variant of the nonogram puzzle game (also known as Picross). A nonogram is a logic puzzle where the player is presented a grid consisting of a number of cells and has to fill in certain cells to create a picture. Outside the grid there are numbers for each row and column which tell the player how many cells should be filled for that line. For example, if it says <em>2 5</em> then the player should fill in first two cells next to each other and then after a gap five other cells next to each other. </p>\n<p>In <em>Pixudoku</em> the player gets feedback from the game by the colour of the marker. If the marker is green then the right number of cells have been filled in although it doesn't tell if it is at the right position. A red marker means that too many cells have been filled. The player can also choose to get clues that help him fill in the right cells. The clue function can be used three times per puzzle.</p>\n<p><em>Pixudoku</em> features three difficulty levels each with 20 puzzles. A new level is unlocked by completing 50% of the former. The game features an analogue look due to its pencil drawn graphics.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Playman Winter Games</em> is one of many games in Mr. Goodliving's Playman series of sports games. The game was originally 2D, but this version is remade in full 3D. As in the 2D version it features four common winter sports events:* Biathlon</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Slalom</li>\n<li>Ski Jump</li>\n<li>Bobsleigh</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Three game modes exist: the training mode where the player can improve his skills in each event, the single event mode where the player gets to compete in any of the events against 10 opponents or against his own personal best, and the tournament mode where the player competes in all four events. </p>\n<p>In <strong>Biathlon</strong> the player skis by pressing the correct key when the tip of his skis touches the blue or orange signs that appear on the track. If this is done correctly the player gains speed, if not he loses speed. Shooting is done by pressing the correct number in the right order as fast as possible. Missing will lead to a five second penalty.</p>\n<p>In <strong>Slalom</strong> the player uses the right and left keys to steer his skier through each gate in the slope. Sharper turns leads to decreased speed and missing a gate leads to a time penalty of five seconds. </p>\n<p>In <strong>Ski Jump</strong> the player has to hit the action button when near the ramp to gain start gaining power and then once again when the power meter is full to take off. For a good jump the player needs to time the jump as near the edge as possible. Once in air the player has to balance by using the left and right keys. To land the player presses the action button again when both skies are straight. The player gets a score that's based on both style and jump length.</p>\n<p>In <strong>Bobsleigh</strong> the player steers his sleigh by pressing left or right. A circle helps him to see if he's on the optimal spot and by succeeding with this the speed increases.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Several years after the heydays of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/185/actua-soccer-series/\">Actua Soccer</a> franchise comes this mobile variant. With its isometric view it looks and plays like a typical 16 bit football game. The player has full movement control over his players in eight different directions. Double tapping a direction key results in a short speed burst for the player. Once in possession of the ball the player can pass it to another player or, when close enough to goal, attempt to score. It's also possible to do crosses, clearances or long passes all depending on where on the pitch the player with the ball is. When the opposition manage to steal the ball the player can to a sliding tackle to take it back. </p>\n<p>A number of game modes exist. The player might choose to just play a random quick match with predefined settings, a friendly with his favourite team or to take part in the Actua Cup. The Actua Cup is a 32-team tournament of national teams which starts with groups of four teams in each and then moves on to the knockout stages. It's also possible to do a penalty shootout, in case the rest of the game isn't interesting enough. Before starting a match or a cup the player can customize the play experience by changing difficulty and duration, whether injuries and fouls should be enabled and choose to play with extra time or golden goal. Before a game it is also possible to edit the squad, choose formation and tactics as well as choosing a strip for the team.</p>\n<p>The game features 32 teams in total, all national teams from all over the world. The game does not use any licenses and therefore all the players are made up. The names can however be changed to whatever the player wants them to be.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This is a mobile version of 2K's first person shooter. Many things remain the same as the original game but this one is played from a top down perspective. </p>\n<p>The year is 1960 and the player character, Jack, is on board a plane crossing the Atlantic ocean. Things go wrong though and the plane crashes. Jack is lucky though and finds himself outside a lighthouse. This is no ordinary lighthouse however. It leads to Rapture, an Utopian underwater city built by the tycoon Andrew Ryan. It's not long until Jack is contacted by a man called Atlas who offers Jack his support. </p>\n<p>Many features of the original game still exists in this mobile adaptation. Not only does it tell the same story, it also comes with many of its gameplay mechanics. Like in any other shooter the player can use numerous weapons, both melee and ranged. In BioShock the player also has access to plasmids which are special powers like electric bolts and fireballs. Rapture is full of splicers, insane people damaged by severe use of plasmids. These are the most common enemies in the game and comes in different shapes such as thuggish splicers that use melee weapons and leadhead splicers that are armed. </p>\n<p>The player will also come across Big Daddies and Little Sisters. The sisters role in Rapture is to collect ADAM from corpses. ADAM is needed by the player to buy new plasmids. To get ADAM the player needs to gather it from a sister. This is not so easy since each sister is protected by a big daddy which has to be defeated in battle. Once the big daddy is defeated the player can choose to either kill the sister and get a large amount of ADAM or save her to get a smaller amount. For every three saved sisters the player will get a gift as compensation.</p>",

The goal of each level in the game is to connect all atoms on the game field into a molecule without leaving any free connections. Atoms connect when the outer connection of one atoms joins the inner connection of another atom. Atoms come in different colours and each atom can only be connected to other atoms with different colours.</p>\n<p>The game features three different modes: research mode, engineering mode and free mode. The modes are made available after the player completes the previous one. The research mode is meant as an educational mode where the player learns to play the game and improve his skills. The player will learn the essence of genetics by researching different organisms. </p>\n<p>In the engineering mode, the player gets develop his own creatures by combining and extracting different genes. The free mode lets the player play and unlimited amount of different levels. These are automatically generated depending on which difficulty the player selects.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Star Wars: Battle for the Republic</em> is a turn-based strategy game set in the <em>Star Wars</em> universe. The player can join either the Separatists or the Republic in their struggle for world domination. The game takes place on a grid of squares where the player gets to command his troops. The troops are moved individually across the grid and enemy troops are attacked simply by moving a troop onto another. When battles commence the squared is zoomed in and a short animation is shown. The losing side will then have his troops removed. Troops can normally only move one square at a time. Therefore the player needs to use transportation ships to travel at light speed. This allows the player to move directly to any unoccupied square. </p>\n<p>There is also other special units in the game. Battleships increases the movement range of troops and additional strength in combat. Shields add extra defensive strength to troops that are behind although they are not movable. There are also heroes that adds combat modifiers to the troop depending on who they are. </p>\n<p>Two campaigns are available, one for the Separatist force and one for the Republic. The Separatist campaign consists of eight missions and by completing it the Republic campaign is unlocked.</p>",

There are 44 in total, some of them including DJ'ing, cocktail mixing, jet-ski racing, crowd surfing, tug of war, cliff-diving and even a wet T-shirt contest. The games take place in six locations: hotel, beach, yacht, bar, nightclub, and campfire. There is a handicap, as there are no instructions, so you will only have five seconds before each game starts to figure out how to play it. The game includes two modes. In Survival you will have to play through all the mini-games to beat your high score, while time-attack mode is more about playing a single mini-game and trying to keep up as its difficulty increases.</p>",

        "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Blockbusters\">Blockbusters</a> was a popular TV game show throughout the '80s and '90s. This mobile game is a football-themed version of that game concept. The game takes place on a board of hexagonal tiles. The idea is to build a chain of tiles from one side of the board to the other. Each tile represents a question that the player has to answer. The answer always begins with the letter that is shown on the chosen tile. Each question has four alternatives that the player chooses from. The time is not unlimited though so he has to be quick in his decision. The player wins when he has made a chain left to right while the AI wins by making a chain from top to bottom. </p>\n<p>In addition to playing against the AI, it is also possible to play two players at the same phone. The player that completes his chain first gets to play the gold run. There is also a challenge mode where the player gets to play a series of increasingly more difficult AI opponents. The twist here is that the player gets additional time in the gold run for each tile while at the same time the opponent can block tiles and thus making the gold run harder. There are four challenges in total and once they all have been completed a marathon mode is unlocked.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Star Trek: The Birds of Prey</em> is a traditional vertically scrolling shoot 'em up where the player takes control of the U.S.S. Enterprise. The game starts with Captain Kirk and his crew aboard the Enterprise receiving a distress signal from planet PSI20. The settlement has been attacked by the Klingons and it is up to the player to defend it and help the survivors.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is quite typical for a shoot 'em up. The player has a top down view of the play field and has to simply shoot down the enemies without getting killed in the process. The Enterprise is equipped with two weapons: phasers and photon torpedoes. The phasers, which recharge automatically, shoot thin beams that do more damage the longer they are focused on a target. Torpedoes are limited in number, but their explosive damage is enough to take out most enemy ships in one shot. The Enterprise also has a shield that blocks shots until it is depleted. It is however recharged over time if the player avoids being hit. The game includes six levels and in addition to shooting down Klingon ships involves environmental traps such as wormholes and asteroid fields. In one level a cloaking device is used to sneak past the enemy defence.</p>",

You will have to do it while two bulls go after you, so any movement in false will make you restart the level. You will have to repeat the same routine for 14 days, with increasing difficulty (there will be more and faster bulls), until the celebrations end.</p>",

It features a series of 18 different button combinations which will need to be either followed on screen in the guided mode, or memorized for later playing in the free mode, sending Diego swerving deftly between defenders until scoring a goal. Maradona is displayed from behind, giving the impression of a camera following him across the pitch as he pulls off various complex dribbling tricks to fend off the rivals, breaking into a Matrix-esque slow-mo mode to show some of the fancier manoeuvres set over 20 levels of difficulty.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>MotorDuels: Outcast</em> is a mobile game combining both racing and combat. The setting of the game is somewhat influenced by the <em>Mad Max</em> movies, where individuals roam the wilderness in armed cars and fight each other. The player takes the role of Ian, who was driven by his home city by a gang lead by Necro and his two deputies. The first levels are set in the wilderness as the player gains levels and upgrades his weapons, before reaching the higher levels which take place in the outskirts of the city. At the higher levels the player mostly fights Necro's deputies, or try to battle Necro himself. Killing Necro wins the game.</p>\n<p>The game is based on duels between the player and various opponents, most of them random (except the three main villains). The two opponents race on a road towards the center, where a prize awaits. Once reaching the center, each do a U turn and heads back. During this time each side can shoot its weapon to hit his opponent. Shot that missed the opponent leaves a hole in the road, which slows down the opponent car if not avoided. Duel can be won both by destroying your opponent's car or by arriving first back to the starting line. Between duels the player can fix his car, buy new weapons or practice (without gaining experience points and levels). </p>\n<p>The game has a relatively advanced AI system which allows the computer opponents to perform and change different techniques, which was noted as one of the strongest features of the game by different game reviews.</p>",

The more blocks that are removed at a time, the higher points will be awarded. A level is completed when all blocks have been removed.</p>\n<p>There are two game modes: challenge and endless. The challenge mode consists of five levels each with three rounds of gameplay plus a bonus round. Between the challenges new special blocks are introduced. These include chain blocks that makes all block vulnerable to popping even if they are not part of the sum, minus blocks that have negative values and that have to be used twice. The bonus round consist of a challenge question that the player has to answer. The endless mode goes on until the time runs out.</p>",

Now he needs help to find Toadstein's castle so that the spell can be broken. </p>\n<p><em>Frogger: Beats n' Bounces</em> takes the original <em>Frogger</em> concept and makes a rhythm action game out of it. The game scrolls vertically and Frogger automatically jumps forward. Since Frogger is cursed he can only move in time with the beat. The player's role in all of this is to direct Frogger left and right so that he doesn't crash into the various obstacles that lie ahead of him. To succeed with this the player has to follow the beat and make the moves at the right time. Frogger can also use his very long tongue to eat insects (flies, butterflies and dragonflies) that he comes across. This also can only be done in time with the beat. Since it often can be hard to hear the beat in the music, the player can also follow it with the interface that flashes for every beat.</p>\n<p>The player scores points for every lane change as well as for every insect swallowed. When making five correct moves in a row the player enters crazy mode and scores double points. Frogger has an energy bar that decreases when colliding with an obstacle. By eating butterflies and dragonflies, energy can be recovered.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Rubik's Bloxx Twister</em> is a match-three puzzle game that despite its license has very little to do with the famous cube. With gameplay similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=tetris-attack\">Tetris Attack</a>, the goal of the game is to match three blocks or more of the same colour by swapping the position of two horizontally adjacent blocks. Unlike <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/24362/bejeweled/\">Bejeweled</a> blocks can only be swapped horizontally. When a match of three or more blocks is made, they disappear and the ones above them will fall down and take their place. New blocks are added from the bottom, row by row, and the player has to prevent the blocks from reaching the top.</p>\n<p>There are two kinds of special power-up blocks: bombs and rubik's cubes. Bombs explode when matched and remove surrounding blocks. Rubik's cubes can be matched with normal blocks and clear every block on the screen of that color.</p>",

The game consists of three missions and the objectives for all of them is to rescue hostages and disarm bombs. If any of the hostages die or the bombs explode, the player has to restart the mission. The first mission takes place at an oil refinery in Venezuela while the second and third one take place at an airport in the Carribean.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is quite simple and involves moving around unseen and shooting the enemies before they can react. Hostages are automatically rescued when the player gets close to them and bombs are defused by simply holding down a button for a few seconds. When an enemy spots the player, he might attack the hostage or arm a bomb. The player then only has a few seconds to disarm it. The player can also enter a scout mode to move around the camera and view distant parts of the map.</p>\n<p>For each mission the player is awarded a medal and when he has all three, a veteran mode is unlocked. The veteran mode is harder and has more enemies. The player also gets a body armor for extra protection.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Geralt the Witcher has just completed his training and is set out to make his way in the world. The game starts with Geralt investigating the presence of a werewolf that is terrorizing the local people. It's not long before he finds out about more insidious evil. Now Geralt sets out on a journey that will be his final test.</p>\n<p><em>The Witcher: Crimson Trail</em> is a mobile game based on the books by fantasy author <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/475202/andrzej-sapkowski/\">Andrzej Sapkowski</a> and the PC game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/30752/the-witcher/\">The Witcher</a> by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/10445/cd-projekt-red/\">CD Project Red</a>. While the original PC game is an RPG, this mobile adaptation is instead a side-scrolling hack-and-slash game acting as a prequel. It involves fighting various monsters, platform jumping and some minor role playing elements. The player can do a simple one-strike attack or more advanced combo attack moves. Further into the game more combos are made available. It's possible to switch between two different swords, one made of silver and one of steel. Some enemies are more vulnerable to one than the other.</p>\n<p>Magical signs are also available. There are four different ones, one that throws back the enemy, one that immobilizes it, one that launches fire, and one that makes the player invulnerable for a short time. After each level the player is able to upgrade one of these. The use of signs is limited by fatigue. The player will find different herbs throughout the levels. These can be used to create potions at the end of the level. Throughout the game the player will come across different NPCs and similarly to the PC game these encounters involve moral choices. For example early on the player gets to choose between healing a character, killing him or just leaving him be.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>BigFoot Challenge</em> is a top-down racing game with monster trucks. Players race against five other, computer-controlled cars on tracks set in the Sahara desert, the dense rain forest of Amazonia and the snow-covered hills of Greenland. There are six tracks in total. There are no weapons, but it is possible to lose the race by taking too much damage. The player needs to avoid bumping into other cars and steer away from stones on the road that cause the car to jump. When moving off the track or taking shortcuts, the car slows down considerably and re-spawns after a while on the road. The two available game modes are quick race and championship. There is but a single car to drive.</p>",

Now he is back at the orphanage to find out what really happened that night when nearly everyone at the orphanage was killed. The player starts out taking control of Ben but will later also get to play as two other survivors: Moon and Karen.</p>\n<p>The game plays like a first person adventure game. It consists of a number of static environments that the player can move between and interact with a point and click interface. With the use of a cursor the player can click on any object on the screen. Doing so opens up a menu with four icons: an eye, a hand, a mouth and a rucksack. The eye is used to examine objects, the hand is used to interact, the mouth to talk or taste, and the rucksack opens the inventory. Action segments exist too. At times the player will come across monsters which need to be defeated. With the press of a button the cursor will then be transformed into a crosshair allowing the player to aim and shoot.</p>",

To do this the player has to shuffle around the tiles until the roads align and a continuous path is created.

        "description": "<p>In a post-apocalyptic world, mutant warriors attack a colony of survivors and abduct two young women. AXA, the sword-swinging heroine of the game who has witnessed the violent raid, follows the mutants' tracks in order to rescue the kidnapped girls.</p>\n<p>She has to find her way through the wilderness where former villages lay waste, cross dark underground caves as well as an old sewer system where creepy creatures linger until she reaches the (not so) deserted mega city where she has to confront the warriors. Her encounter with the final boss takes place on the top of the mutants' headquarter's building.</p>\n<p>On her way AXA not only battles attacking creatures like enormous rats, stray dogs, giant spiders, mutated wasps and aggressive alligators, but has to master challenges in solving puzzles to be able to continue her path. Along the way, she discovers useful items which she can collect, use directly or combine in her inventory to get an even more useful object.</p>\n<p><em>AXA</em> is an action-adventure featuring three big levels, six different graphical settings, 50 rooms to explore and more than 20 items to interact with. While the player uses the direction pad to have AXA walk, jump, climb and fight her way freely through the scenes in 2D arcade style, an icon-based menu can be popped up to perform the puzzle-related tasks such as examine, use or combine things.</p>\n<p>The mobile game features original illustrations from Spanish artist Romero on whose comic strips and books the game is based. They introduce the player to the different chapters of the story and also reward him at the end of the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Set in the year 1891, <em>Sherlock Holmes: The Official Movie Game</em> features the famous detective Sherlock Holmes and his loyal friend Dr. Watson. They become involved in a strange murder case related to a secret cult of Lord Blackwood. Players control Holmes or Dr. Watson (or sometimes both of them) in each level, fight enemies, collect items and solve puzzles to get to the goal. Holmes fights with his powerful punches and kicks, while Watson uses his gun with further distance and less damage.</p>\n<p><em>Sherlock Holmes: The Official Movie Game</em> is an action game based on the 2009 film <em>Sherlock Holmes</em>, though there are some changes in the plot. Players move the character to the final goal while trying to sweep out enemies on the way. Depending on the context, not all people are enemies; players can talk to some of them to get information. Sometimes, between a conversation, players have multiple choices to choose what your character will respond, though choices don't affect the game much. The Genius Vision icon helps players identify suspicious places so that players can move on. Collected items are stored in a chest. Items are various, but players can only use health restorers anytime; the other items can only be used in certain places.</p>\n<p>The graphics are in isometric 2D. When players reach the goal, the game will be automatically saved. Depending on the final score of each level, there are 3 kinds of ranking: S, A and B.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Triagonal</em> is a mobile phone puzzle game in which the player has to place falling gems in a certain way to make them disappear \u2013 not unlike <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6116/dr-mario/\">Dr. Mario</a>, but with some special clues.</p>\n<p>The crystals appear randomly in five different colours (green, yellow, red, pink, blue), either single or paired. The player has to build diagonals of (at least) three same-coloured elements by moving and rotating the gems accordingly to make them disappear. There are also two different layers (front and back) to consider; crystals pile up only if they are in the same layer.</p>\n<p>If the player manages to crack at least one combination of each colour, s/he completes the word BONUS on the right side. This feat will be rewarded either by three wildcard gems that have a chameleon-like quality in adopting any colour or by a cross-hair to shoot out some unwanted crystals.</p>\n<p>Chain reactions help to clear the space, but the gems fall faster and faster and when the field is packed, the game is over.</p>",

Players can choose freely from four different levels: Party Pooper, Minion for a Day, Itchy Lucius and Ghost Smackin'. </p>\n<p>There are objectives in each level (all levels contain no fewer than two objectives), and players must complete them to proceed. In order to do so, players have to move Jimmy around, talk to people and (less often) get necessary items and interact with objects. You can see your inventory and objectives anytime. Moving Jimmy to the bottom of the screen when in a location will lead him to the town's map, which players can use to change their location. Sometimes, playing through a mini game is required. If this happens, an instruction will appear, telling players what to do in the game. There is also a hidden bonus too: the Lava Worms. you can collect them to boot your final score.</p>\n<p>The graphics are isometric 2D. The maximum number of save slots is 3. Players have a choice among English, French, German, Spain and Italian.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Edgar is a furry little creature with a distinct curiosity that tends to get him into trouble. This time he got himself trapped in an extensive cave system from which he can only escape with a lot of skill and savvy.</p>\n<p>The cave system consists of  45 independent rooms - 5 tutorial caves and 40 main caves - each with a single exit that Edgar has to open by solving puzzles. Each exit will guide Edgar to the next room until he will eventually reach daylight again.</p>\n<p>Edgar can walk and float \u2013 by rotating his tail \u2013 through the rooms. He digs through loose dirt effortlessly and pushes single objects \u2013 like boulders \u2013 out of his way provided the area behind them is not blocked. However, he is not strong enough to stop falling objects whereas it is no problem for him to dig a path underneath a still object.</p>\n<p>The exit of each room opens when all balloons and symbol blocks in that room got eliminated. They disappear when they touch an identical element, so, basically, Edgar has to bring the objects together. This is not always an easy task as they often seem to be unreachable far away from each other or because there are odd numbers of objects of the same kind. In that case, Edgar must find a clever solution since bringing together only two of them would leave the third one behind. In some rooms, Edgar also has to pick coloured keys to open doors of the same colour to proceed.</p>\n<p>Edgar meets creatures like bats, spiders, ghosts or skeletons along his way which go after him immediately if they detect him. Sometimes, he can knock them out by dropping a boulder onto their tops or luring them into the magma, for example. In most cases, however, Edgar is well advised to stay away from them contrary to the treasure chests and crystals he can collect along his way (to raise the high score).</p>\n<p>Neither a time limit exists, nor are Edgar's lives restricted. The progress is saved automatically, so Edgar can take his time to solve the puzzles of each room and give it a new try, if he gets injured or the room got unsolvable. Edgar is also allowed to skip three rooms. So even if he can't figure out the solution for the current room, he still has the chance to proceed with the game. Rooms that were solved, however, can be played again to gain a better score.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party</em> is a collection of twelve mini-games starring the Raving Rabbids (spin-off to Ubisoft's Rayman series). The mini-games are in some way based on movies and TV series; like Band of Rabbids (Band of Brothers) or Rabbid Jones (Indiana Jones). This is a one-button game, all mini-games are played using only the '5' key. The game starts with only one mini-game unlocked. By playing the mini-games, you collect golden carrots that you can use to unlock the other mini-games in any order you want.</p>\n<p>This is the complete list of minigames:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Band Of Rabbids:</strong> In this mini-game you and other Rabbids are in free fall. Your job is to launch gum bubbles to the falling Rabbids in order to avoid them from hitting the floor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rabbid Of Persia:</strong> Side-scroller runner. You use the '5' key to avoid deadly obstacles.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Wild Wild Rabbid:</strong> You are in control of a locomotive that moves forward automatically. On top of the locomotive's chimney there is a Rabbid. Your job is to activate the chimney at the right moments sending the Rabbid through the air and avoiding the incoming missiles.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rabbid On The Moon:</strong> In this one you have to jump from moon to moon avoiding mouse traps and falling into the deep space. The Rabbid is always walking around the moon, when you press '5' he jumps to the nearest moon in line.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Croc Rider:</strong> The Rabbid is on a life saver pulled by a crocodile. The game presents a top-down view with the crocodile moving to the top of the screen. The crocodile changes direction when the '5' key is pressed. The goal of the mini-game is to avoid that the crocodile (and the Rabbid) collides with the ropes that delimit the track.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Supersize Rabbid:</strong> The goal of this mini-game it to catch the food being thrown from above. The Rabbid is always running and changes direction (left or right) by pressing the '5' key.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rabbid Jones:</strong> In this mini-game you move to the left jumping on top of balloons or swinging yourself on the ropes hanging from them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Independence Rabbid:</strong> You are attached to a rocket going to the sky. You need to press the '5' key when the rocket is in the desired direction to activate the rocket's engine and advance through the sky avoiding different obstacles.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Eye Of The Rabbid:</strong> In this mini-game you fight against another Rabbid. A number of target circles will appear on different spots of the Rabbid; for each one of those circles, another larger circle will appear and begin to shrink. You have to press '5' when this circle is inside the target circle in order to punch the Rabbid at that spot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Seven Seas Rabbids:</strong> Descend into the deep sea avoiding octopuses, sharks and other sea animals. The Rabbid moves in circles and changes direction when you press '5. By combining these two movements (clockwise and anti-clockwise circular movement), you can move in any direction you want.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rabbid Trek:</strong> The Rabbid is traveling along some kind of wormhole full of obstacles. The Rabbid moves in spiral through the wormhole changing direction when the '5' key is pressed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rabbid Tower:</strong> Your job in this mini-game is to build the highest tower of Rabbids that you can. For that you have to drop the Rabbids as close to the center as possible to keep the tower balanced.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p>This version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=The+Sims+2\">The Sims 2</a> is a downscaled game fit for cell phones. This version stays somewhat true to its big brother on the PC, while obviously limiting the amount of items and activities to work with the less powerful hardware.</p>\n<p>The game lets the player pick a \"Sim\" out of a list of premade ones, both male and female. The game starts with the Sim living in a small already-made house. Through using objects around the house as well as talking to other Sims who visit the player the Sim's skills will increase. They include: cooking, charisma, body, logic and creativity. Higher skills means that the Sim can do things better and get better jobs down the line.</p>\n<p>The Sim also has certain \"wants\" which the player needs to meet, such as buying a coffee maker or telling a dirty joke to another Sim. The more the Sim interacts with other Sims, the better friends they become. This can in the end lead to a relationship or even marriage with any of the 6 different computer controlled Sims.</p>\n<p>The money the Sim makes can be used to buy things for the house (such as a flat screen TV or a bathtub). These will not only make the house look nicer, but when used they raise the different needs bars much quicker. For example, buying a stove will make it easier for the Sim to eat than if he only owned a microwave oven. There are also extra rooms for the house which can be purchased, adding new activities and features for the Sim to partake in. Also, a constant drain of money is that every meal of food eaten costs a small amount of money.</p>",

        "description": "<p>During a battle with Sonic (in Super Sonic form), Dr.Eggman uses his new weapon and manages to trap Sonic. He then drains the power of the Chao Emeralds from Super Sonic and use the power to create a blast strong enough to shatter the Earth into pieces. Seeing that Sonic is now useless to him, he jettisons him and quickly gets away. When Sonic wakes up, he finds a little creature who apparently has lost his memory. Sonic calls him \"Chip\" and promises to get his memory back. What Eggman doesn't know is that the ray also gives Sonic the ability to turn into a beast called \"Werehog\" at night. With this ability and Chip's guidance, Sonic must travel around the world to stop Dr.Eggman, find shrines that fixes the Emeralds, and defeat Dark Gaia - a beast unleashed from Eggman's new weapon...</p>\n<p>Players take control of either Sonic or Werehog in each level, battling enemies and collecting rings or other items while trying to reach the goal. A level can take place at day or night (or both). During the day, players play as Sonic, and when night comes, Sonic turns into Werehog. Sonic and Werehog have different abilities and weaknesses: Sonic is faster but weaker, whereas Werehog is stronger but slower. The day levels and night levels have been suitably designed for both Sonic and Werehog, so you have to make the best use of their abilities. There is an energy gauge enabling Sonic and Werehog to use special attacks, which can be recharged by collecting items or fighting enemies. Rings are the only things that keep Sonic alive. Sonic will lose a certain number of rings if he touches an enemy. Doing so can kill Sonic immediately if he has no rings left.</p>\n<p>The game's graphics are in 2D. Players' process is automatically saved when completing each level. Every three levels form a \"zone\".</p>",

Players take control of Keymon's fishing line, though players cannot move it much. The hook moves from side to side. In order to catch the moving fish, players have to choose the right time to release the hook. Different kinds of fish will give players different points. Beside fish, rubbish also present; catching them can decrease players' score. Sometimes, one or two crabs appear and is/are ready to grab the hook when it gets near and hold it until players pull it out. Players also meet a rectangular thing with a question mark on it which will have various affect on players (give players strength, increase/decrease points) There is a time limit and a \"goal\" score. Players have to reach at least the goal score within the time limit to proceed the next level. As player proceed, there will be obstacles, making it harder to reach fish.</p>\n<p>When players lose a level, it is possible to restart it with the score unchanged. After each level (except the final level), there is a \"did you know\" fun fact which tell players things related to fish.</p>\n<p>The graphics are in 2D. The game knows no save function. High score can be recorded in the <em>Top Score</em> section.</p>",

The games starts in Lost Heaven where the young gangster is sent on a mission to Empire Bay. His job is to kill Tommy Angelo, the protagonist of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7190/mafia/\">Mafia</a>. </p>\n<p>It is an action game played from a top-down perspective. Unlike the PC/console version it is not an open world game. Instead it is split into levels where only a small part of Empire Bay can be explored. The levels consist of locating an NPC to retrieve a mission that most of the time involves killing members of rival gangs. The player can then walk around the level or steal a car and drive. The levels are not completely linear. By exploring the player can find money, weapons and health packs. Each level also has side missions that can be done. Combat is straightforward. When using a gun the game auto-aims at the closest enemy and the player only presses a button to shoot.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Paid to Kill</em> the player takes control of the assassin Ramon Spectre. After being knocked out, he wakes up in the Siberian snow without any idea of what has happened or where he is. Almost instantly he meets Falkov, his assistant, who tells him who he is and what he has to do. It turns out Spectre is on a mission to kill the bosses of a terrorist organisation known as Ground Member. </p>\n<p><em>Paid to Kill</em> is an action game played from a top-down perspective that involves both shooting and sneaking. Shooting is simplified and the player does not need to aim. He simply draws his gun when he needs it and Spectre will automatically shoot when enemies are within range. It's often necessary to use stealth or the guards might pull the alarm. By using shadows and corners the player can avoid enemy contact. Shooting an enemy without being noticed causes triple damage. It's also possible to hide in closets. Sometimes it's necessary to plant explosives to blow up fences. They can also be used to kill enemies. The player earns money for taking out the terrorist bosses. It can then be used between missions to purchase upgrades such as increased speed and weapon damage.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>3D Bomberman Atomic</em> is a mobile version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Hudson+Soft+Company+Ltd\">Hudson Soft's</a> long running series. Although the game uses three dimensional graphics the game is still viewed from a traditional top down perspective. The basic gameplay remains the same too. The player moves through a maze and has to destroy his enemies by placing bombs in strategic locations. The enemies will die if they are within range of the bomb. When all enemies are dead the player has completed the level. Different power ups exist. These can have both positive and negative effects on the player. For example there are power ups that allows the player to push or throw bombs while others increases or decreases the movement speed. There are also different level elements such as moving belts, teleports and jumping pads that are needed to navigate through the levels.</p>\n<p>The game has a campaign mode that consists of a number of stages (each with a few levels) that has to be completed in order. Each stage represents a planet with it's own graphical style. Unlocked stages can be played on their own in the single play mode. There's also a match mode which is for multiplayer against up to three other bombermen. On Sony Ericsson handsets this can be played against human players via Bluetooth, while on other handsets it's only against AI controlled opponents.</p>",

Each letter is worth a certain amount of points based on how common it is and the idea is to get as many points as possible when all letters have been used. The game can be played solo against the AI (whose skill level can be modified) or against other human players by passing the phone around. There are a few different game modes. The classic mode plays just like the original board game (although with some options to modify the rules) while in the solitaire mode the player gets the whole board for himself and has to try to get as high score as possible. The quick game modes does away with the board and instead the player gets to create four words with as many letters as possible. There is also a tutorial mode for those that wants to learn the basics.</p>",

Enemies may drop weapon, armor and potions. When the player acquires a certain number of experience points, his character gets a level-up and the player may invest those points in the character's basic parameters - damage dealt by certain types of weapons, resistance to an element or weapon type or health points.</p>",

The premise of the game is simple: a boy loves a girl; when the boy is asleep an evil gang kidnaps the girl. The boy is awakened by his brother who tells him what has happened and instructs him along the way. The game is played on static screens with platforms, enemies, hazards, etc. In the beginning the boy has no weapons, so he must avoid all enemies or attack them stealthy with a punch. Later on he acquires a weapon and magical spells. Along the way the boy can collect coins which allow him to buy spells and potions.</p>",

You are one of the final five castaways on a remote island, your goal is to be the last who leaves it. Each day you do your chores (Fishing) and participate in one of the contests (Log Run, Wild River, Spirit of Fire, Spear Throw). But beware: each night a Tribal Council is held and of the castaways is voted off the island. To avoid this you need to show the best result in daily activities and contests or make pacts with other castaways.</p>",

The player can rotate the falling pair of notes and move it left and right until it lands. If at least four notes of the same color are touching, they disappear and the player receives points. Sometimes, a blocking note falls down; it can only be removed if a note next to it disappears. The game level increases as the player receives score; on higher levels, the notes fall down more quickly, but the player receives more points for matching them up. It is possible to start from any level.</p>",

The player takes control of a man called Sam Gibson who remembers little of his life before becoming a mega-corporate killer for hire. Now the year is 2022 and Arasaka wants him dead. Gibson has been charged with murder and it's up to to the player to find out why and who is behind the plot.</p>\n<p>The game is a platformer similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Flashback\">Flashback</a>. The player can walk and run left and right, jump, crouch and climb ledges up and down. When entering combat the player uses a gun at long range or a melee attack at short range. Once enemies have been killed the player can take their armor and other items they might carry. Items that can be found include implants and new weapons. After taking damage, medic kits can be used to restore health.</p>\n<p>The player can hack various computer terminals he comes across. By doing so it's possible to get access to weapon and stat upgrades and to unlock doors. The player might also come across links to the game's website where more of its back story is revealed. Hacking involves playing a mini game that is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=QIX\">QIX</a>. The game has some minor RPG elements although the player's stats increase automatically as he progresses through the game. There are also implants that can be used to give the player an advantage through special abilities.</p>",

The player takes the role of a member of S.A.N.D. (Secret Alliance of Nebulous Directives), a secret organization that investigates bizarre occurrences around the world. The game was released in an episodic format with new episodes being released weekly. Each episode contains a number of scenes from a certain occurrence. In addition to the episodic story mode there were also daily puzzles each consisting of a random scene that was automatically chosen every day. </p>\n<p>The gameplay works like in other hidden object games with the player's crime computer generating a list of objects that the player then has to locate within the current scene. When the player finds an object he moves a cursor to it and clicks on it and it's removed from the scene. Once all objects have been removed the crime computer will analyse the clues and explain what has happened. Scenes are often larger than the screen size and therefore it's necessary to scroll through the scene by moving the cursor to the edge. If stuck, the player can use a hint to get some help in locating an object.</p>",

The gameplay consists of moving Lifty and Shifty to catapult the animals (Cuddles, Giggles and Petunia) with the trampoline into the air to hit hazards such as barbed wire, saws and knives. This makes them spill blood and the raccoons (Lifty and Shifty) collect the blood in their buckets. Only three animals can hit the ground or the game is over. New hazards are unlocked by getting high scores. The blood bank pays for each pint. There are four difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, Hard and Bloody.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>WordCrafter</em> is a word creation game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Scrabble\">Scrabble</a>. Unlike Scrabble it's a single player game and the primary goal is not to score points but to connect the starting tile with the ending tile through a chain of words. Words are created from a random selection of seven letters that the player sees at the bottom of the screen. Once a word has been created the available letters are removed and a new selection is randomized. The player has a limited number of turns to complete each level and it costs a turn every time new letters are added, either by shuffling or by creating a word. In case the player is stuck he can use a hint that shows a possible word. Hints have a cooldown period of 30 seconds before they can be used again. The game boards have various special tiles which are activated when words are created on top of them. These include multiplier tiles that increase the score of the word. There are also exclamation and question marks that trigger a spin on a bonus wheel and tool tiles that can remove walls.</p>\n<p>On the board are also three stars which the player can attempt to collect by including them in the chain. These are needed to unlock new worlds in the adventure mode. Each world consists of a number of levels that are unlocked by completing the previous ones. There are also Greek letter tiles that has to be collected to unlock the final world. Sometimes the player will come across challenges, for example to complete a level only with words starting on certain letters. Once these have been completed they can be played on their own outside the adventure mode. There is also a freeplay mode where there are no time and turn limits or goals. Instead the player can aim to get a high score.</p>",

This is done by switching pairs or by pushing them off the top of a column onto the next stack. Power-ups can be used to clear blocks on land and in the air. There are three challenges on each planet and you can choose from four different events, such as Shoot (launch a number of blocks off-screen), Timed (countdown and a required count), Puzzle (only a limited amount of moves), and Boss (fight an alien monster at the top of the screen). Next to the main story mode there is a separate puzzle and survival mode. An original mode, with the gameplay of the original <em>Meteos</em> where blocks cannot be moved horizontally, is unlocked after completing Star Quest.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Carmageddon</em> is a mobile game based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/367/carmageddon/\">PC game with the same name</a>. Like in the original series it is a violent racing game that's as much about doing damage to opponents' cars and running over pedestrians as it is about winning the race. The most notable difference is the use of a 2D top down perspective. There are four drivers and four cars to choose from and 36 events in three different environments (city, countryside and desert) that can be played either on their own or as part of a championship. In the championship the aim is to rise in rank by competing in various events. For each event won the player will raise his position by one. This is needed to get access to new events. Between events it's possible to upgrade the car. There are a few different kinds of events, including checkpoint racing, hold the flag and destruction arena.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Thief: Deadly Shadows</em> for mobile phones was divided into two episodes each containing eight missions. It follows the story line of the PC/console version but differs in that it is a side-scrolling 2D platforming game. The focus on stealth is still intact though and like in the original series Garrett's main objective of each mission is to steal specific items and a certain amount of loot. To succeed in sneaking past the guards, Garrett has to avoid bright light and hide in the shadows where he can not be seen. If spotted, civilians will alert nearby guards who will immediately draw their swords and attack. Like in previous <em>Thief</em> games there is a light gem in the HUD that shows how much light there is at the current location.</p>\n<p>When getting close to a guard or civilian, Garrett can pick their pockets or attempt to knock them out with his blackjack. By doing this the player can retrieve important items and vital information, sometimes necessary to complete the mission. A knocked out body can be picked up and carried away which can be necessary since a spotted body will raise the alarm. In addition to the blackjack the player has access to some other items. There are three types of arrows; water for extinguishing torches, noise maker for distracting and broadheads for knocking targets. There are also two kinds of bombs: flash bombs that temporarily blind enemies and gas bombs that releases poisonous gas that knocks out enemies. Other items include health potions and a mechanical eye that can be used to scan further ahead into the level. </p>\n<p>Between regular missions there are rooftop levels where Garrett has to escape from the scene of crime. These are action sequences that work similar to endless runner games where Garrett moves forward and the player has to jump at the right time to avoid falling. Once the rooftop level is completed the player will get to a shop where loot can be sold and new items can be bought.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Thief: Deadly Shadows</em> for mobile phones was divided into two episodes each containing eight missions. It follows the story line of the PC/console version but differs in that it is a side scrolling 2D platforming game. The focus on stealth is still intact though and like in the original series Garrett's main objective of each mission is to steal specific items and a certain amount of loot. To succeed in sneaking past the guards, Garrett has to avoid bright light and hide in the shadows where he can not be seen. If spotted, civilians will alert nearby guards who will immediately draw their swords and attack. Like in previous <em>Thief</em> games there is a light gem in the HUD that shows how much light there is at the current location.</p>\n<p>When getting close to a guard or civilian, Garrett can pick their pockets or attempt to knock them out with his blackjack. By doing this the player can retrieve important items and vital information, sometimes necessary to complete the mission. A knocked out body can be picked up and carried away which can be necessary since a spotted body will raise the alarm. In addition to the blackjack the player has access to some other items. There are three types of arrows; water for extinguishing torches, noise maker for distracting and broadheads for knocking targets. There are also two kinds of bombs: flash bombs that temporarily blind enemies and gas bombs that releases poisonous gas that knocks out enemies. Other items include health potions and a mechanical eye that can be used to scan further ahead into the level. </p>\n<p>Between regular missions there are rooftop levels where Garrett has to escape from the scene of crime. These are action sequences that work similar to endless runner games where Garrett moves forward and the player has to jump at the right time to avoid falling. Once the rooftop level is completed the player will get to a shop where loot can be sold and new items can be bought.</p>",

The scenario and the dialogue has also been adapted. It takes place at a holiday party in a cosy mountain chalet and the participants say things like \"I hope you've been good this year\".

The player takes control of Santa who with some assistance from his helpers has to deal with some rebel Christmas balls who are trying to boycott the Christmas celebrations. Santa obviously can't let them do this so now he has to battle them by shooting more balls at them so that clusters of three of more balls of the same colour are created. The gameplay is more or less identical to the original <em>Puzzle Bobble</em>. The player aims with a pointer (which here happens to be a gigantic candy cane) and shoots at the balls above him. By creating clusters of the same colour the balls are removed. Each of the game's ten level is completed by clearing all the balls. The game ends if balls reaches the bottom of the screen and is made harder by the ceiling that descends as time goes by.</p>",

The player takes control of the titular half man/half machine and has to rid the streets of Detroit from the various criminals that roam about while protecting it's innocent civilians. RoboCop can walk left and right, jump over smaller obstacles and use elevators to move between platforms. When starting out a simple pistol with unlimited ammo is used but other weapons like machine guns and shotguns can be collected. The game features three different stages: the streets of Detroit, an abandoned steel mills and the police headquarters. The objective in each is to rescue a number of hostages and to do so numerous bad guys has to be shot down although sometimes they give up and can be arrested. The game is over when RoboCop's health meter reaches zero but health can be recharged by picking up food that is given by rescued hostages.</p>",

The game is viewed from the side and the player can swim in all directions and use a harpoon to shoot down any shark that gets too close. The objective of each level is to reach a treasure chest and to collect as many coins as possible on the way. At the same time it's necessary to avoid two kinds of dangers: sharks and spiky sea urchins. Any contact with these leads to a life being lost. Points are earned for killing sharks (100 each) and collecting coins (10 each). An extra life is given for every 100 coins collected.</p>",

The player races against the other two on one of 15 tracks. Various power ups are found in the form of Zamor Spheres. Using these on opponents has a different effect depending on color. Yellow drains an opponent's fuel, red damages opponents, and blue slows opponents down. Scenery can be crashed into, so racers must steer clear of obstacles. Running out of fuel causes a racer to crash. Opponents can also be attacked, destroying them or slowing them down. Getting first place awards 1200 points, second place 800 points, third place 400 points, and destroying an opponent gets 300 points.</p>",

The game features all the characters from the comic, and the player can control either Mortadelo or Filem\u00f3n depending on the level. Each character has different abilities. For instance, by using different disguises, Mortadelo can transform into different characters, like a rocker who smashes enemies with his guitar, a caveman with a club as weapon, a granny, a snake, a tank and more. Filem\u00f3n in the other hand, can use different weapons, as a plunger gun, a heat gun, etc.</p>\n<p>The levels are varied with indoor and outdoor locations. In some levels the characters have to use different vehicles, like a jet ski or a car. There is one level inside a sinking ship, where the water is rising and the player has to hurry up to stay above the water level to avoid drowning, while fighting enemies and avoiding obstacles at the same time. The water effect was very advanced considering the platform limitations, with simulated refraction and wave effects which deformed the part of the level under water.</p>\n<p>The player advances from level to level defeating different bosses and advances through the story, which resembles the funny and bizarre situations from the comics.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Sumea Ski Jump</em> is a ski jumping game viewed from an isometric perspective. All action in the game is controlled with a single button which can be any of the phone's number keys. When starting out the player has ten seconds to begin and should attempt to the hit the button when the wind indicator shows green. To take off the player then has to hit it again when the jumper is as close to the edge as possible. Once in the air the button should be pressed to stop the jumper in an optimal leaning position (as close to horizontal as possible). When it is time to land the player can either hold the button for a telemark landing (which gives more style points) or a quick press for a normal landing (which gives more distance). The score given depends on the jump distance and the number of stars given in the jump (depending on how well each action has been done).</p>\n<p>The game consists of six hills from real life ski jumping locations: Lahti, Oberstdorf, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Innsbruck, Bischofshofen and Planica. Each hill is unlocked by winning the previous one in a competition against three AI jumpers. There is also a multiplayer mode where four players share the same device.</p>",

The classic mode is essentially the same as the original game with the player having to guide five frogs over a road and a river in an attempt to reach their home at the top of the playing field. Some differences exist in terms of of level designs and obstacles that the frog has to jump past. For example in the second level the road section has both cars and crawling snakes while in another one the player will come across dinosaurs and spike pits.</p>\n<p>The evolution mode is entirely different and is more similar to a puzzle game. Here the aim is to collect all the coins on each level and to reach the exit. Additional abilities are available to Frogger such as double jumping and extending his tongue.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The JAVA title <em>Asphalt: Nitro</em> is vastly simplified 2D version of the 3D Android game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/75785/asphalt-nitro/\">Asphalt: Nitro</a>. In countries such as China, Japan, Russia and USA players race other cars to reach the finish line first. Next to quick races in the free play mode, there is a career mode divided into seven seasons with multiple events for each one, unlocked gradually. Up to five stars can be earned per event, required to keep unlocking new tracks and seasons.</p>\n<p>Just like the main game the focus is on gathering nitro boost to gain extra speed and stay ahead of the other racers. Nitro is earned through a drifting mechanic, taking down other cars, risky driving and perfect runs, and jumps with stunts in the air such as barrel rolls or using obstacles to drive on two wheels. There are also blue and yellow bottles on the track that can be picked up for additional nitro. Nitro fills a horizontal meter near the top of the screen. It can be activated up to three times to access additional power levels, but draining faster. Doing stunts, beating speed limits and taking down cars fills up to six letters of a wanted level. When full, a police car starts to chase the car and it is possible to be busted. Police cars also put vehicles on the road that cause the car to crash upon collision. Tracks have regular traffic as well.</p>\n<p>The cash earned in races can be used to buy or upgrade cars. Cars can be upgraded for acceleration, top speed, handling and nitro, multiple times. It is also possible to choose between different car colours. Compared to the Android version it does not have the many different game modes or multiplayer, the locations are fewer and there is also a smaller collection of cars. The included licensed cars are the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport, Chevrolet Corvette C7, Dodge Challenger SRT8, Ferrari LaFerrari, Ford Shelby GT500, Lamborghini Veneno, McLaren P1, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X, Nissan 370Z and RUF CTR 3.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Lumines: In The House Ibiza '10</em> is an entry in the Lumines series of rhythm puzzle games that's exclusively made for mobile devices. It features tracks licensed from British house music record company Defected. Like its predecessors it is a falling block puzzle game where two-coloured 2x2 squares are dropped onto the playing field and the player has to arrange them by moving and rotating them so that clusters of four or more same-coloured squares are created. They will then be removed as a time line crosses the screen. </p>\n<p>This version has four game modes. In the challenge mode the player unlocks skins and music by clearing each stage. Skins that are unlocked will then be available in the skin edit and time attack modes. In the skin edit mode it's possible to play through skins in any order by creating playlists. The time attack modes involve clearing as many squares as possible within a certain time and there are four different time limits to choose from: 60, 180, 300 or 600 seconds. The final mode is the dig down mode where the player has to clear at least two columns and allow the time line to reach the far right to progress.</p>\n<p>Track list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aston Martinez - Seduction (Climax Dub)</li>\n<li>Karizma \u2013 Ride</li>\n<li>Fish Go Deep - The Cure &amp; The Cause</li>\n<li>Albin Myers - BOOM!!!</li>\n<li>DJ Tekin - Wait Forever (Doruk\u2019s D Floor Mix)</li>\n<li>Gene Farris - Sanctified Love (Original Mix)</li>\n<li>ATFC - Savannah</li>\n<li>Gel Abril - Spells Of Yoruba (Original Mix)</li>\n<li>Sandy Rivera - Changes (rnb mix)</li>\n<li>Havana Funk - Bakiri Ban (Club Mix)</li>\n</ul>",

As the title implies the game takes place in Tokyo which was the third location of the original game. Lara's quest is to find Excalibur, King Arthur's famous sword which has been shattered into three pieces. The first shard is believed to be in the possession of a Japanese relic collector named Takamoto so Lara goes to Tokyo in an attempt to get the shard. The problem however is that Takamoto is a boss of the Yakuza who likely won't give it away freely.</p>\n<p>The game is a side-scrolling platformer with polygonal 3D graphics. Most of the gameplay involves running left and right, jumping between platforms and shooting the various Yakuza members that stand in Lara's way. Obstacles such as electric cables and laser defense systems have to be avoided either by jumping over or rolling under. Sometimes Lara has to swing around poles or use her grappling hook to reach far off platforms. The grappling hook can also be used to swing into and knock out enemies. The gunfights are quite simple and only Lara's regular handgun can be used. Bullets can be dodged by crouching but the enemies can do the same.</p>",

He has been chosen as the leader of a team of humans who has to enter the Underworld Tournament and defeat four teams of supernatural beings: skeletons, green skinned creatures, ice trolls and succubae demons.</p>\n<p>The game consists of single quick matches and a cup. The cup involves playing each underworld team in order and as matches are won the teams are unlocked in the quick match mode. The matches are viewed from an elevated scrolling side perspective and there are five players on each side. The main difference from other football games is that super powers can be used. Each opponent has its own super power and the player acquires them by winning the matches. During matches the powers can be used once the player's power bar is fully charged.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>King of the Cabbage World</em> is a mobile game made for multiplayer matches between two players. Each player controls a mole who attempts to kill the other mole by throwing exploding vegetables. The game is played from a side view perspective and the lower part of the screen consists of a network of tunnels that the mole can use to hide. The upper part of the screen is above ground and shows the opposing mole in the distance. There are three standard weapons: carrots, onions and cauliflowers, each exploding in different ways. The vegetables grow on the surface and can be dug up by the mole. </p>\n<p>In addition to the multiplayer game which is played online there is also a practice mode for one player. By winning matches in the online mode credits are earned which can be used to buy more weapons. A match is won when the opponent is caught in an explosion.</p>",

This version has largely the same gameplay and uses a powerbar to take shots. A button press starts the meter moving with the second press deciding the power and the third the accuracy of the shot. New to this game is the option to add spin which can be done while the ball is in the air. Another new feature is to get a tip from the caddie on how to putt.</p>\n<p>The game contains a quick play mode, a career mode and custom games. The career mode involve competing in tournaments to earn cash. The money earned can then be spent on training lessons to improve skills or on new equipment such as clubs and balls. Custom games can be played against an AI opponent or against another human in hotseat multiplayer. It is possible to play a full course or just specific holes. There are three courses but only one is available from the start while the rest have to be unlocked. Also different game modes can be unlocked in addition to match play.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Vijay Singh Pro Golf 2005</em> is the first game in the Pro Golf series. The game uses a third person perspective that changes to a top down view when the ball is in the air. Similar to many other golf games it uses a power bar to take shots. A button press starts the meter moving with the second press deciding the power and the third the accuracy of the shot. On the green the same bar is used for putting.</p>\n<p>The game includes two game modes as well as a quick play option. There is a tournament, the Gameloft Trophy, where the player has to beat 29 other golfers to win and there is a versus mode which includes stroke play and match play. Before starting a game it's possible to choose between a number of golfers with different abilities as well as the difficulty level. The easiest level uses a simplified shot mechanic where only the power has to be set.</p>",

The main difference is the golfing locations available which are all new: Italy, Dubai and The Open (Turnberry, Scotland). In the career mode only Italy is available from the start with the other having to be unlocked in order. Another difference is that the licensed golfers from the previous game have been replaced with fictitious ones.</p>",

The player can take control of one of six candidates, three for each party, and run to become president. The candidates are all caricatures of real American politicians: Barack Obama, Rudy Giuliani, Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, Mitt Romney and Fred Thompson. It's possible to do a complete tour with both primary and presidential elections or to just do the presidential tour. The game is played on a map of the United States divided into six regions. The player starts in north east and has to reach a vote target in each one. </p>\n<p>To win votes the player plays a number of mini games. For each location four games are played and the performance decides the number of votes. Among the mini games are a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Breakout\">Breakout</a> variant where the candidate has to knock out a number of activists that are blocking the path to a limousine, a parade consisting of quick time events, a rhythm music game with the candidate dancing and a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a> variant where the candidate has to collect ballots from the white house's garden while avoiding guards</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Penalty Challenge</em> is a mobile football game that is exclusively about penalty shootouts. It works like in the real game with each player shooting five shots and if it's a tie after that they get to shoot one more until a winner is decided. The game can be played against AI opponents or another human player. In the single player mode the player automatically progresses to a new AI opponent after a win until reaching the fifth and final one. Shot taking is menu based with the player having to press three buttons: first to decide height, then aim and finally curl. The goalkeeper is controlled by simply pressing the right directional key as a shot is taken. In a two player game, the first player takes a shot and then hands over the phone to the opponent who attempts a save.</p>",

The gameplay continues the series' tradition: fast-paced soccer matches from the top-down perspective. Besides a dedicated button for passing, shots are produced by kicking the ball in the air and then pressing the correct buttons for directions (similar to moving a joystick in a direction). Additional moves available are slide tackles and diving headers. When not in ball possession, the nearest athlete is selected automatically.</p>\n<p>The game modes also follow the example of the originals: there are friendlies, cup and challenges. The latter two can be customized to a point, including which of the 50 national teams (no original names) participate. Additionally there is a challenge mode which sets the player in pre-set match conditions.</p>\n<p>Cell phones with higher technical specifications receive a few additional features: besides an intro video and replays, they have some limited tactical options: nine formations and substitutions during a match.</p>",

It does not feature the puzzle or versus modes that are a mainstay of the series, but only an endless mode.</p>\n<p>Gameplay follows the standard model: the player controls a cannon at the bottom of the play field that shoots randomly colored bubbles. When three or more bubbles of the same color touch, they are removed from the field. After several shots (in a deviation from the norm, this version of the game is not in real time), new bubbles are added from the top, pushing the already existing bubbles downward. The game ends once the bubbles reach the bottom. Removing bubbles increases the game level. The game starts with bubbles of three colors on the field; later levels add more colors, increasing the difficulty.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Worms Crazy Golf</em> is a mobile game spin off in the Worms series. It's like the main series played from a side view perspective but is based on the sport of golf with the difference that a grenade is used instead of a ball. The aim of each hole is to reach the flag in shortest amount of shots with the aim of blowing up the enemy worm that is sitting in the hole. The controls simply involve moving a cross hair to set the aim and then pressing the fire button to start a swing meter that sets the power of the shot. In addition to the regular grenade, there is also a timer grenade which explodes after five seconds. If it lands in the hole the player gets a one shot bonus and if it doesn't a one shot penalty.</p>\n<p>The game contains an amateur mode and a pro mode with the difference that the latter has wind that affects the flight of the grenade. There are three courses with different themes and each course consists of nine holes. One course is available from the start and the other two are unlocked by completing the previous ones with a par or better score. The game can be played by up to four players on the same device.</p>",

Players may also buy elixirs which will automatically restore Gust's health once it drops to zero. The game has numerous bosses for Gust to fight and Gust's fairy Vivi will allow him to use magic attacks, as well as push boulders in his way.</p>\n<p>There are 3 types of magic attacks in the game: <em>Fire</em>, <em>Ice</em> and <em>Vampire</em>. Each attack can destroy boulders of the opposite colors, as well as harm or restore the health of the enemies it is used on. Finding fairies of the corresponding color will increase the power of the magic attacks.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Time Crisis: Elite</em> is a mobile entry in the <em>Time Crisis</em> series. It is a shoot 'em up game on rails but the gameplay is much different from the light gun games in the main series. The game uses side scrolling isometric graphics where the screen is divided into a 3x3 grid. Each grid area corresponds to a number on the keypad and by pressing one of the numbers the enemies occupying that area of the screen will get fired at. For example pressing 1 fires at the top left corner. After clearing all enemies from the screen the game scrolls to the next area of the map. By shooting several enemies in short amount of time, combo bonuses are given. As ammo runs out the player has to take cover and reload. Some enemies use crisis flash shots which will always hit unless the player ducks into cover in time. Taking a hit or running out of time leads to one life being lost and the game ends when all have been lost.</p>\n<p>The game contains two different game modes. The arcade mode is the story mode where the player takes control of Nate Rush, a rookie special agent who along with his new partner has to complete a very important mission and dispose all his enemies. There is also a survival mode where the player has to hold out against endless hordes of enemies.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Time Crisis: Mobile</em> is an entry in the <em>Time Crisis</em> rail shooter series. This title for mobile devices is an alternate version and spin-off of the main <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10752/time-crisis-3/\">Time Crisis 3</a> game. The player controls the elite cop Richard Miller, a special agent from the intelligence agency VSSE (Vital Situation, Swift Elimination). His objective is to liberate a compound of enemy targets within a time limit. True to the original games the movement and camera angles are all handled by the computer in a cinematic style with quick movement, the player only needs to shoot. This is done using different control schemes. In the first an on-screen cursor needs to maneuvered between targets. When it is close enough, it locks on automatically. Another option has the screen divided in nine squares where the device keys are used to quickly press them to shoot in the corresponding square. Touch to aim directly is also supported on some devices.</p>\n<p>The player quickly needs to alternate between a cover position and coming out to shoot. Using cover is the only way to reload the gun. That position always makes the character invincible, but it is necessary to dispose of enemies quickly as when the timer runs out, the character starts taking damage. Shooting is disabled while reloading. Enemy shots are either marked yellow or red. Yellow ones are misses and can be ignored, while red ones do damage if they are not avoided through seeking cover. Many enemies take multiple hits and life bars are shown.</p>\n<p>Next to the main Story mode five Crisis Missions can be unlocked by reaching certain targets in the Story mode. In the options the difficulty level and the number of lives can be adjusted.</p>",

The aim of the game is to eat fruit but Leon can only eat fruit that is of the same colour as his skin. Leon is moved around the screen from a top down perspective and uses his tongue to catch the fruit. As one is eaten, Leon's skin changes to the leaf colour of that fruit. By using the tongue, Leon can drag himself across gaps as he eats a fruit. To complete a level Leon has to reach an exit which is possible also when not all fruits are eaten. However to unlock new worlds a certain number of fruits in total have to be eaten. The game contains four worlds each with nine levels. The levels can be played in any order.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Super Yum Yum 2</em> is the second game featuring the fruit eating chameleon Leon. This time Leon has to rescue his babies which have been scattered around the world by a giant fish called Tum Tum. The gameplay works the same with Leon having to eat the fruit of each level by using his long tongue. For each fruit eaten Leon's colour changes to the one of the fruit's leaves. It's only possible to eat fruits that are of the same colour as Leon's skin. When eating fruit it is also possible to use the tongue to drag Leon across gaps.</p>\n<p>What's new in this game is that Leon also has to collect his babies. Rescued babies are needed to eat giant fruits. There is also a mini game where the objective is to kick the babies into a giant fruit and then eat the fruit from inside. The more babies that are collected the easier the mini game will get.</p>",

If there are any neighbouring bombs, the number of them will be shown. Flags can be placed as an aid and the player also has access to a limited amount of probes which can be used to reveal areas of safe tiles.</p>\n<p>The game can be played in three difficulty modes with different map sizes and number of mines.

The game is made up of five locations and in each two opponents have to be defeated to unlock the next. Before matches bets are placed and the money won can be spent on new cues that improve the shot accuracy. After each won match there is also a challenge that can be played to increase the money earned. </p>\n<p>The game looks and plays similarly to Gameloft's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/23378/midnight-pool/\">Midnight Pool</a> games. Aiming is done by rotating the cue around the ball and lines indicate how the balls will move. When taking a shot a meter appears which is used to set the power. There are also advanced controls which can be used to add spin to the ball.</p>",

Chains can be created vertically, horizontally or in any shape as long as the letters are connect adjacently in the right order. It is also possible to create multiple chains and combos. Some special events affect the game such as rising and falling snow levels which influence the difficulty, special balls that act as jokers and the possibility to launch the Grinch which can crash through balls.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Everybody's Golf Mobile</em> is a mobile game based on Sony's console game series which is known as Hot Shots Golf in North America. Like in other golf games shots are taken from a behind view but unlike the console games this version uses sprite based 2D graphics. First the player is presented with an overhead view of the playfield where the direction of the drive is set. Shots are taken by hitting a button when a bar starts filling to set the power and then once again when a yellow mark crosses a white line to set the aim. There is also an easy mode where only the force of the strike needs to be set.</p>\n<p>The game consists of three modes of play: tournament, training and challenge. The tournament features nine contestants who compete for skills and points are given based on results. The training mode is for practising and testing out clubs. By performing well the player earns points which can be used to buy clubs and balls that increase the character's skills. By completing challenges, new characters can be unlocked.</p>",

The gameplay in this edition is mostly identical to the previous iteration. It is played from an isometric birds eye view and has the same controls with the same moves being possible to do. This includes performing lobs, flip-flap tricks and one-two passing. </p>\n<p>Like before the game has a FIFPRO licence which means that it features real life players but it does not have any real team or competition names. In addition to the common friendlies, cups and leagues the game adds two new game modes. There is the Road to 2008 which involves qualifying for and competing in the Euro 2008 and there is a challenge mode where the player has to complete objectives. For example, the first challenge is the World Cup 2006 final and the player takes control of France after Zinedine Zidane is sent off with the objective of winning the final.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Real Football: Manager Edition</em> is the first in a series of management spin-offs in the Real Football series. Its release coincided with the 2007/2008 season and features the top two leagues from five European countries: England, Italy, Spain, France and Germany. There are real players but no real team names so for example Arsenal is called London and Manchester United is simply Man. Red. There are about 4,000 players each with individual stats in 14 categories. </p>\n<p>Similar to other football management games the player is in control of picking a team and tactics, designing a training plan, buying and selling players as well as hiring coaches and scouts. Tactics can be set for both the team as a whole as well for individual players. The game uses the isometric Real Football match engine which allows the player to watch the full 90 minutes of a game. It is also possible to change to an overhead view or a stats display during the game.</p>",

It's possible to sprint but only until stamina runs out. Passing and diving over the line is done with a single button which when held or pressed down at the right moment is also used for mauls and line-outs. Conversion kicks are done from a first person perspective and uses a power meter to set the strength of the kick.</p>\n<p>The game contains four game modes: friendlies, tournaments, leagues, training and mini-game. There are four tournaments (International Cup, Euro 6, South Cup and Euro Clubs Cup) and six leagues (World, Euro, South, French, English and Isles). The mini-game consists of a sequence of kicks where the player earns points for each score. It ends when a kick is missed.</p>",

Guards can be sneaked past or be taken out by firing, strangling or jumping onto them. It is also possible to hold a guard hostage. In addition to the regular gun the player also gets access to flash grenades and a sniper rifle. Next to the guards there are also mines, security cameras, laser sensors and turrets to watch out for.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Block and Score Soccer</em> is a strategy game that is loosely based on football. It is played by two opponents who each have their own sets of fourteen balls that are placed in identical patterns on the field. The aim of the game is to score points by kicking balls off the field on the opponent's side of the field. At the same time, those balls that remain have to be used to block the shots of the opponent. The players take turns kicking one ball at a time and the ball always moves in a straight line until it hits another ball or goes over the sideline. Balls can be kicked in any direction but not if there is another ball immediately next to it in that direction. The game goes until neither opponent can make another move.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Wizardry: Chapter 1</em> is a mobile game based on the long running <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Wizardry+series\">Wizardry</a> RPG series. The game starts with the player waking up in a cell with a hangover and no idea what has happened. A guard explains that he has rampaged an inn and attacked the mayor's son who now wants the player's head. However, the town's sewers need to be cleaned out and the player can please the mayor by accepting the task.</p>\n<p>The game starts with the player creating a character which is done by choosing a class (fighter, mage, priest or thief) and a race (dwarf, elf, halfling, gnome or human). Unlike other games in the series, only one character is created at the start but more can be added to the party by talking to NPCs. Each character has stats in four categories: strength, luck, defense and attack and these increase automatically when levelling up. Experience is earned by winning battles and solving tasks and to level up the player has to visit the character's guild.</p>\n<p>Similar to other <em>Wizardry</em> games, the player explores the game world from a first person perspective, but when combat begins, it changes to a side view with enemies on the left and party members on the right. Actions for each character are selected from a menu with five options: fight, defense, herbs, spell and flee. The combat is turn based like in other <em>Wizardry</em> games.</p>",

Untrue to the franchise, it is a turn-based game split in two phases \u2013 base construction and combat. It is set during the Third Tiberium War, and features GDI and Nod units, albeit certain Nod units are reskins of GDI counterparts due to technical limitations. It has only a GDI singleplayer campaign.</p>",

The first one is a side scrolling platform level with automatic running. Two buttons are used: one for swinging between rooftops and one for shooting a web at enemies standing in the way.</p>\n<p>In the second stage Spider-Man runs through a subway tunnel and has to avoid oncoming trains. It's possible to jump up to the ceiling to avoid the trains but it is necessary to jump back down to avoid hitting a barrier. The third and final stage is a battle against Doc Ock. He attacks with his mechanical arms which Spider-Man has to web up. Once all arms are webbed it is possible to capture the villain. Once all stages have been completed the game restarts at a higher difficulty.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ministry of Sound: Club Manager</em> is a management simulation game where the player takes the role of a club owner and DJ. As the manager the player has to hire staff (bartenders and bouncers), buy supplies (beer and spirits) and new club features (such as bars and dance floors), adjust prices, buy advertisements and hire DJs. The player can hire one DJ for each night of the week and personally DJ one night per week. All this is done weekly and then the full week is simulated night by night. When playing as the DJ the game plays like a rhythm action game where the right arrows have to be pushed in sequence. After making some money it is also possible to release records and conduct tours.</p>",

In 2053, in a town called City Z located on the moon a computer goes out of control and starts destroying the city. Players take the role of a scientist who has decided to destroy the RuneX computer.</p>\n<p>The combat is turn-based and usually players will get to fight one enemy per battle. Sometimes monsters can summon allies to assist them in combat. The game doesn't tell players how many experience points they've acquired after combat, it only tells which skills were improved and how much gold was acquired. Players may also buy medicine and goods that will increase their skills. Weapons can be found in the monster infested areas inside chests. Some weapons, such as guns require AP to fire them. All the monster infested areas are randomly generated and finding a stairway will transfer players to the next area. Players can always return to the city by using a Lunar Car found in the beginning of each new map.</p>",

While the levels and the gameplay remain unchanged (Save for the main character being able to take 3 hits before dying) a backstory was added to justify the inclusion of 2 playable characters.</p>\n<p>Two ninjas, while undergoing training, stumbled upon a secret organization plotting to take over the ninja world. Both ninjas set out to rescue the captured ninjas and destroy the organization.</p>\n<p>Although there were no changes made to the core gameplay, all the graphics have been redrawn with the main character being based on Hotsuma from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/shinobi-\">PS2 game</a>. The bosses have had their names changed. The children that Joe Musashi had to save in the original game were changed to female ninjas. The controls were adapted for mobile phones so jumping to the platform above is done by holding the jump button.</p>\n<p>The game offers the option of saving it after completing each stage and in some stages players may find books dropped by the enemies. Collecting all the books will unlock a third, hidden character.</p>\n<p>There are 3 difficulty levels in the game with only the Easy mode being available from the get-go. The Normal and Hard modes can be unlocked after a complete successful playthrough. Completing the game once also unlocks a Challenge mode where the player must survive as long as possible in the shuriken throwing bonus stage.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Air Strike 1944</em> is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up similar to Gameloft's earlier <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Siberian+Strike\">Siberian Strike</a> series which it also shares characters with. Although the game takes place in war time Europe, it is a highly fictional take on World War II with the objective being to save the continent from the dictator Darkstein. The game starts out in England with the player having to liberate London before moving through an underwater tunnel to Normandy. Ultimately the aim is to reach Darkstein's castle and hidden hidden base in Germany. </p>\n<p>The gameplay is almost identical to the Siberian Strike games. By destroying enemies power ups that increase fire power and medals that give extra points can be collected. Other pick ups include shields, missiles attacks and extra lives. In addition to regular fire the player also has access to a mega bomb that kills everything on the screen. The game has a total of nine levels, some of which end with a boss fight. There are also a few slalom levels where the player has to maneuver through tunnels without crashing.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Derek Jeter Pro Baseball 2005</em> is the first entry in Gameloft's annual baseball game series. The game features both batting and pitching as well as fielding and running. When batting or pitching the game uses a behind view of the batter which when the ball is hit switches to a bird's view perspective. Pitching is done by choosing one of four pitch types and then moving a cursor over the strike zone. Batting involves timing the swing as the ball reaches the strike zone with dedicated keys for fly balls, grounders and aiming left or right. When defending fielders can dive or jump after the ball and throwing is done by entering the number of one of the bases.</p>\n<p>The game has four game modes: quick plays, exhibition games, seasons and playoffs. Other than Derek Jeter himself, none of the teams or players are licensed. The season can be played with either 29 or 58 games and it's possible to simulate matches without playing them. Some minor management options exist with the player being able to change the team's lineup and the pitching rotation.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Scarface: The Last Stand</em> is a gallery shooter based on the final shootout starring Tony Montana from the 1983 movie <em>Scarface</em>. The game can be played either in a regular mode or in an endless survival mode, but with similar gameplay. Tony Montana is shown from a behind view in fixed, single screen location. The screen is divided into nine sectors that correspond with the number on the keypad, so pressing 9 will make him fire in the top right sector and 4 the left one in the middle. Different types of enemies appear and need to be taken out. Tony can quickly move from an opening position to cover. Cover prevents him from getting hits by bullets, but not grenades and rockets as these damage the cover and need to be shot out of the air. While in cover the gun's ammo is replenished and some health is restored. Moving from cover to the open firing position and vice versa is the only form of movement that is possible.</p>\n<p>During gameplay power-ups sometimes appear. These need to be shot to activate them. There is armor that catches ten bullets without damage, a grenade that offers three rounds for a grenade launcher, rage for improved damage, unlimited ammo for a short period of time, a star for a score bonus, full health, and an explosive that damages everything on the screen. Damage to Tony is shown as bullet holes on the screen. When there are too many he dies. Enemies preferably need to be engaged when there is a blue bar above their heads as that means they are reloading. A score multiplier up to ten for successive kills can be gained.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Call of Cthulhu: Darkness Within</em> is an adventure game inspired by the writings of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/633/h-p-lovecraft/\">H. P. Lovecraft</a> developed for mobile phones. The game takes place in Cairo in the 1930s. The protagonist is a student of a professor who gets a letter from his teacher asking him to come to Cairo ASAP as he has uncovered something extraordinary and fears that he is in danger. Balthazar Carter arrives only to find that his professor had gone insane and the expedition is put on hold. The new director is known to be interested in the occult and doesn't take kindly to Balthazar's curiosity. Being an expert in old Religions, players will need to help Balthazar uncover what happened to the professor, what was the find as well as the mysteries of an ancient religion which worships the god Cthulhu.</p>\n<p>The game plays out as a point-and-click adventure, but instead of a mouse interface, players control the protagonist directly with him walking to the direction key players have pressed. Players are hinted when they're close to usable objects or people and can trigger a menu where they can choose what they want to do with the objects. Players can pick up and use items and during their adventures they will see a lot of cutscenes of what's going on in the city. Players switch to a top-down view when traveling through the city. The buildings players have access to are indicated with an icon.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Holy Wars: Sons of Enoch</em> is an Action RPG for mobile phones based on a French comic book. Players take the role of Cain, a knight of a holy order delivering a message to the king of a neighboring kingdom in order to cleanse the land of pagans. On the way to the other kingdom, the knights are attacked by Golab mercenaries and after defeating their leader, find out that the Golabs were paid to kill the knights. Cain follows the trail to the bandit village to investigate who betrayed the holy knights and paid the mercenaries to kill them.</p>\n<p>The game offers different kinds of swords and axes which can be upgraded to unlock additional moves. Upgrading the weapons to the next level requires players to have the corresponding amount of the weapon of the same kind. Two weapons are equipped by Cain and different combinations can boost his attack and defense. Travelling from area to area is done on a world map with random encounters which transfer Cain into a small map and have him battle the enemies in real time. Players can also fight in arenas and break barrels within a time limit to earn extra gold.</p>",

Lucas has lost his wife Emily and is slowly getting his life together with Catherine, while John goes out to find his wife Emily while battling monsters.</p>\n<p>While players are in control of Lucas, they can talk to NPCs and push boxes and when the game switches to John, players can equip weapons and tools to fight monsters and progress further through the game. The game adds an element of stealth as monsters can't see the protagonist when he's walking in darker areas and shooting alerts all the monsters nearby, causing them to attack the protagonist.</p>\n<p>The game features two endings and depending on the chosen ending, a New Game Plus mode is unlocked which can either give the protagonist unlimited ammo or make the monsters much stronger.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Get Rich or Die Tryin'</em> is a mobile rap star simulation game made to capitalize on the movie starring 50 Cent.</p>\n<p>In this game, players create a rapper and go all the way from rags to riches. Players have 3 years to become the best rapper and they can do so by recording tracks that chart, as well as clubbing, shooting other rappers or cars that follow them around and by having rap battles with the fellow rappers. Each action advances the game for 1 week.</p>\n<p>Players start with 2 genres and 2 topics that they can choose when writing a song and need to have inspiration in order to be able to record something. Unlocking additional genres is done by hanging out at one of the clubs and checking what the DJ plays. As for topics, their names hint how to unlock them. It's important to manage money in the game as getting to a negative balance and not covering it up with record sales will lead to a game over.</p>\n<p>Talking to fellow rappers may lead to rap battles which help players earn extra money, as well as unlock new clubs and studios to record better quality tracks and players are given the choice to diss a rapper when recording a track which lowers their relationship with the chosen rapper. Players can also buy bling, which can raise the rapper's inspiration level, as well as allow him to score with one type of girls.</p>\n<p>In case the players have a very bad relationship with a rapper, they may try to shoot them on contact and players will sometimes be followed by a car with a gunman in it. In these cases, players must shoot their enemies within a short time limit or they will be shot and waste in-game time in a hospital. Going crazy in clubs may also get the rapper imprisoned.</p>",

Training is done without any opponents and in Championship a qualifying race is required to determine the starting position for the real race. The available tracks are Brazil, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Monaco, Spain and United Kingdom. While driving acceleration is done automatically, the player only need to brake and steer.

The player has access to acceleration, braking, and steering the car left and right. By pressing lightly on the brake and then a directional arrow it is possible to skid. There are obstacles on the track that need to be dodged to prevent damage to the car. The track has pick-ups that replenish fuel or repair damage. Arrows provide guidance for turns. There are also jumps and sometimes the road branches into two paths: one dangerous and fast, the other easier and slower.</p>",

Compared to the previous game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/129629/dakar-2007/\">Dakar 2007</a> by the same developer the gameplay has become more arcade-like and there is a shift from a first-person perspective to a behind view now.</p>\n<p>The Rally mode takes the place through the different stages. The HUD shows progress for the distance, current speed, current and best time, the condition of the car, the amount of boost and the number of collected flags. In addition to completing a stage without totalling the car, there are also ten blue flags to pick up as well as a souvenir piece. Based on the total performance a bronze, silver or gold medal is awarded. Controls consist of acceleration, braking and steering. Skidding through sharp corners is possible by braking slightly while turning at a high speed. Courses have obstacles and cracks in the road that need to be avoided. There are many pick-ups: manual boosts, a shield for a brief invincibility, a power-up that makes the car bounce like a frog several times, full repair, and a manual jump. Arrows with different colours warn for upcoming turns and their curve or large gaps.</p>\n<p>Next to the main Rally mode there is Quick Race and Flag Chase. In Flag Races the course is littered with flags and they all have to be collected before time runs out. Stages can only be played in the Quick Race mode when they are completed in the Rally mode. Trophies are stored in a separate Trophy Room. There are four cars to choose from.</p>",

The car needs to avoid obstacles to prevent damage. The condition of the car is shown through a wrench bar and damage affects the car's performance. There is also a fuel meter. Every type of surface has a different traction that affects speed, so the player needs to choose the optimal route for the most efficient fuel consumption.

One of the two players is chosen as the character and three game modes are available: Exhibition, Tournament and Championship. The tournament is played Australia, France, UK or USA. There are options for the number of games (two or six), the amount of sets (one, three or five) and the difficulty level (easy, medium or hard).</p>\n<p>Movement is done using four keys. Generally only a single button is used to hit the ball, but with different options. By pressing Up or Down before hitting the ball, a lob or a drop shot is performed respectively. Precision and power increase the earlier the effect is applied before taking the shot. The shot direction can be determined through three separate buttons (left, centre, right). The direction keys for left and right can be used in the same way to add effect and determine the direction. By pressing the button twice an automatic lob or drop shot is performed. For the service a gauge is filled slowly and the player determines when to execute it. Doing it too soon results in a weak serve and waiting too long leads to a fault as the ball goes out.</p>",

While on the other side they find themselves on the ship the Dawn Treader witch is under attack by pirates at that moment. Caspian rescues the trio from an attacking pirate giant and explains the situation. The player now takes control of one of the heroes and switches between Edmund, Lucy and Caspian. Lone islands and other locations from the movie are visited like the island where Eustace is transformed into a dragon.</p>\n<p>Gameplay includes defeating enemies including bosses with a sword as well as solving simple puzzles. In some parts the player will control a rowboat and has to evade rocks and attacking pirates on a rowboat. Health and stamina can be replenished along the way by picking up bottles dropped by defeating enemies or destroying jars or opening treasure chests.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Roland Garros</em> is a tennis game based around the yearly gravel tennis tournament in France. The game offers three game modes: Practice, Exhibition and Roland Garros. The mechanics are a continuation of the developer's earlier title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/129639/ferrero-vs-moya-tennis/\">Ferrero vs Moya Tennis</a>.</p>\n<p>The player can be freely moved around the court. Shots are done using three keys for different directions: left, centre and right. When a shot button is pressed twice, an automatic dropshot or lob is performed. Before hitting the ball up, down, left or right can already be pressed to change the shot direction. Serving is done using a charge meter. A yellow marker shows where the ball is going to land. Game options include the amount of games and set, and changing the difficulty level.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Roland Garros 2007</em> is a tennis game based around the yearly gravel tennis tournament in France. It is a follow-up to the developer's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/129782/roland-garros/\">Roland Garros</a> from the year before. The game modes are Practice, Exhibition and Roland Garros.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is fairly identical to the previous game, but this version has slightly faster exchanges and there is a small amount of scrolling compared to the fixed screen of the previous game. Some versions of the game have support for local versus multiplayer matches against another player through Bluetooth. New to the series is that female competitors are now included as well. Players are unlicensed, but name and appearance closely match the real ones. Players also have different characteristics now, based on the parameters accuracy, speed and strength.</p>\n<p>The player can be freely moved around the court. Shots are done using three keys for different directions: left, centre and right. When a shot button is pressed twice, an automatic dropshot or lob is performed. Before hitting the ball up, down, left or right can already be pressed to change the shot direction. A yellow marker shows where the ball is going to land. Serving is done using a charge meter.</p>",

In the Championship mode different GPs are done playing as Daniel Pedrosa.</p>\n<p>Acceleration is done automatically, the player only does the steering and braking. A combination of both can be used for sharp turns. Every GP starts with a qualifying round with a single lap racing alone to determine the starting grid for the real race with opponents. While racing arrows warn for upcoming turns. Breaking a circuit's lap record unlocks it for single races. There is no damage model.</p>",

It is the 2D version of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Rival+Wheels\">smartphone game</a> with the same name which it differs from in the use of an isometric birds' view perspective and gameplay that is most similar to an endless running game. Races take place on three-lane streets where the player moves left and right in an attempt to reach the finishing line without hitting cars, trucks and other obstacles. In addition to the runner races, there are also pursuit races where the player has to catch up with an opponent and duel races where bosses have to be defeated by gear changing on time similar to the smartphone game.</p>\n<p>The game has three locations (Tokyo, Havana and New York) each with ten races. Each race has three objectives with the player earning wheels for each. Wheels are needed to unlock the next location. During races, coins can be collected and afterward used to unlock special skills. Each bike has one special skill. All bikes are licensed from manufacturers such as Suzuki and Ducati and are unlocked by winning races.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Sumo Smash!</em> is a party game for up to three players with sumo wrestlers challenging each other on a platform. The game is played on a fixed-screen showing a platform with the sumo wrestlers using a top-down view. The wrestlers cannot be controlled directly. They constantly rotate in a stationary position at a fixed speed. By pressing and holding down a button the player makes the wrestler go forward in the direction he is facing for as long as the button is pressed. As soon as the button is released the wrestler starts rotating again. The game can be played in different game modes: Challenge (collect sushi playing along against a time limit), Tag (a game of tag) and Fight (bump other wrestlers off the platform). As only a single button or key press is used up to three players can participate simultaneously in local multiplayer using the same device. When playing alone the computer controls the opponents.</p>\n<p>The game is almost identical to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/130619/jumbo-rumble/\">Jumbo Rumble</a> by the same developer released in the same year. <em>Sumo Smash!</em> only replaces the elephants with sumo wrestlers.</p>",

It's an action RPG like previous games in the series but has 2D graphics that mixes a bird's view perspective with characters that are drawn from a side view. The game takes place on five islands (each with three stages) that have appeared in the ocean after a mysterious earthquake. The strange islands are full of demon forces and the player is a bounty hunter that travels there to keep the menace at bay.</p>\n<p>Similar to other action RPGs, the game involves fighting large numbers of enemies while collecting new equipment and leveling up. The player can equip two weapons at a time that can be switched during game time. Additionally, there is a bracer that can be used for a magic attack and a shield that can be activated for protection during combat. Weapons include greatswords and dual blades as well as ranged weapons such as staffs and crossbows. The game has some quick-time events where the player quickly has to press a button.</p>\n<p>New equipment is given after completing a level. All items and enemies can be one of five elements (water, fire, nature, death, light) with each element having a bonus against another element. Items can be upgraded by combing them with other items. When an item reaches its maximum level it can be evolved to a higher tier. Items that has reached its maximum tier can be fused with items of the same type and of the same tier.</p>",

The game plays mostly the same as its precursor and features street racing from various locations around the world. New features include the super boost which is borrowed from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Asphalt+6:+Adrenaline\">Asphalt 6: Adrenaline</a> and helicopters that fire rockets at the player's car.</p>\n<p>The game's main mode is the story which follows the same structure as the one in <em>Fast Five</em>. It's made up of seven chapters each with five races which have to be completed to progress to the next chapter. As progress is made new cars, parts and characters are unlocked. Most race modes are the same as in the previous game and include normal races as well as events that involve drifting or taking out the opposing drivers. New modes include Collector which involves grabbing enough money and Wanted where the player has to avoid getting busted by the police.</p>",

The original version of the game was based on the UK version of the show but it was later localized and adapted to the shows of other nations. Each version has its own graphics but has the same gameplay and features except for some minor variations. </p>\n<p>The gameplay is the same as in the TV show. The player has to choose from 22 identical boxes and pick the one with the highest value. Each box has a value between 1p and \u00a3250,000. Thereafter the player starts opening the boxes to reveal the content of each. After every round, the player gets an offer from the banker and the player has to decide to take the deal or carry on playing. This will then go on until there are only two boxes left and the banker gives his final offer. If the player still rejects the offer, the banker may offer to swap the remaining box with the one in possession of the player.</p>\n<p>There are two game modes: instant play and challenge mode. Instant play is a single game while involves playing through a full season twenty episodes. For each episode, the player has to qualify by earning enough money in the previous one. Additionally, it's necessary to answer at least one quiz question correctly to advance to the main game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>WRC: FIA World Rally Championship Mobile</em> is an officially licensed mobile racing game. This version of the game is in 2D and therefore differs a bit from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/139767/wrc-fia-world-rally-championship-mobile-3d/\">3D version</a>. Most of the content is the same but it only has a third-person perspective and the graphics are sprite-based and less detailed. Controlling the cars works the same though with the player steering and braking while the acceleration is automatic.</p>\n<p>The game has two game modes: championship and arcade. The championship mode simulates a full season and the player is given points in each race depending on the position. Bonus points are awarded when passing through special crowd pleaser events. Earn enough points and extra car bonuses are unlocked. The arcade mode is played against five other cars and in each race the player has to finish high enough to advance to the next rally course.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ryan Giggs International</em> is a football game named after the Manchester United player and Wales international Ryan Giggs. The game is played from a bird's eye view that scrolls from side to side. Controls are simple with tapping a directional key for a pass and holding it for running with the ball. When in a goal-scoring position an indicator turns blue and tapping any key then will lead to a goal. Defending is limited to changing the player in control while tackling is automatic. </p>\n<p>The game features two modes of play: friendlies and tournaments. Friendlies are single games while the tournament is a simple cup competition where the player has to advance through the rounds. In both modes, the player can choose from international teams and they can be played at either amateur or professional difficulty level. All players except for Ryan Giggs are unnamed.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Blood+</em> is an hack and slash platform game based on the anime series Blood+ created by Production I.G. The game is set in the fictional town of Shiki-Newtown, which has recently been terrorized by attacks from monstrous bat-like creatures called Chiropterans. Players control the anime's main protagonist Saya Otonashi, a high-school girl who is capable of killing the Chiropterans and their ultimate goal is to find and kill Diva, Saya's younger twin sister.</p>\n<p>Saya wields a sword and unlocks new combos as players progress through the game. When Saya's enemies are close to death, a Down Arrow sign appears above their head and pressing the corresponding key will initiate a sequence of keys players must press for Saya to effectively dismember the enemy. Defeated enemies drop crystals which charge Saya's Bloodlust meter and using the finishing moves mentioned above will help fill the meter faster. Once the meter is full and players activate Saya's Bloodlust, enemies start taking more damage, with most enemies taking one hit to be stunned, and another hit to be killed. Players may also find healing items and lore items that tell them about Saya's past in trunks scattered all across the levels.</p>\n<p>Besides the Story Mode, players may also fight in an Arena, where Saya must defeat as many enemies as possible without dying. As players defeat enough enemies, the areas of the upper levels of the Arena will open.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Super Jewel Quest</em> is a mobile entry in the Jewel Quest match-three puzzle game series. It plays similarly to other puzzle games of its kind. Matches are created by creating groups of three or more jewels of the same kind. Making matches of four or five jewels destroy additional jewels of the same color. There are two kinds of levels: regular ones where the whole board has to be turned into gold and boss levels which are played against an AI opponent. Boss levels are turn-based and involve being the first to collect a certain amount of jewels or to turn 70 percent of the board into gold. There are power-ups that are made available by matching coins. The first one is a hammer that can be used to remove a single jewel from the board.</p>",

The main difference is that it allows the player to play through the full World Cup competition with any of the 32 competing national teams. It replaces the cup and scenario game modes of FIFA 06.</p>",

The most notable difference from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/144836/fifa-08/\">FIFA 08</a> is that it uses a side-on viewpoint instead of the isometric perspective used since <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/24710/fifa-soccer-2005-mobile-international-edition/\">FIFA 2005</a>. The graphics of the game has also been updated with a new animation system and improved framerates. The skill-bars that were introduced in Euro 2008 make their FIFA debut although they are only used for shooting and tackling. New skill-moves such as 360 pirouettes, and step-overs have been added and it's also possible to do one-twos by double-tapping the pass button.</p>\n<p>Game modes include training, friendlies, seasons, challenges and penalties. A new feature is called My Team. When first starting the game, the player gets to select a favorite team. The game then tracks everything done with that team, makes it the default team for friendly matches, and customizes all the menus in its colors.</p>",

It's the first mobile release in the series and differs from the PC version in that it's entirely text-based. The player can take control of a team from one of ten leagues and has to live up to the board's expectation or risk getting axed. It's possible to buy and sell players, set training focuses, pick a lineup, formation and basic strategy. During matches, what happens is presented with text commentary and the player's interaction is limited to making substitutions and changing formation strategy</p>",

The game is an adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/144843/fifa-10/\">FIFA 10</a> and has the same gameplay. The main difference is that it allows the player to play through the full World Cup competition, with or without qualification. When choosing to play the qualification any international team can be selected. There is also an option called My World Cup where the player can enter the competition with any team and where the opposition is randomly chosen. A new game mode is the Free Kick Challenge which consists of 12 rounds with the aim of scoring two free kicks in each. The Be A Pro mode from FIFA 10 is here called National Hero and works mostly the same way.</p>",

The game uses an isometric game engine like mobile FIFA games of its time, but the player does not have direct control over the players. Instead the player interacts with the game by a set of cards. There are four kinds of cards: pass cards, shoot cards, defend cards and special cards. The player can pause and select a card at any time and the game then continues and the player watches how the action plays out.</p>\n<p>The game has three game modes: quick match which is played against a random opponent, competition which is a full Champions League season and fantasy team which is like competition but with a custom built team.</p>",

The game uses the same isometric game engine as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/144836/fifa-08/\">FIFA 08</a> but introduces an all-new control system designed to be suitable for a more casual audience. Movement of players works the same as before, but all other actions (shooting, passing, crossing and tackling) are done with one button. When in the right position, pressing it brings up a slidey bar with a moving pointer. To successfully perform an action it has to be stopped in the green area of the bar.</p>\n<p>Game modes include the full Euro 2008 finals as it was played in real life and the My Euro 2008 mode which allows the player to choose from 53 European national teams with either randomized or real-life groups. There are also modes for quick matches and penalty shootouts.</p>",

However, the true mastermind behind the attacks is actually the newly elected President of Venezuela, Juan Crespo. Crespo managed to get elected by advocating a strong anti-terror platform and exploiting the fear caused by the terrorist attacks (which he himself orchestrated). Crespo's plan is to discredit Saudi Arabia, then cut off the Venezuelan supply of oil to the United States, creating an oil crisis and driving up the price of oil, which he would then sell to the US on the black market at highly inflated prices.</p>\n<p>The game maintains gameplay similar to other mobile titles like the point-and-click squad controls and missions' targets like rescuing hostages, disarming bombs and dealing with terrorists enemies in multiple possible ways (i.e. silent from the back or with a bullet in the face).</p>",

The game is a short, linear Russian visual novel, which takes its inspiration from Lovecraft's works. The game mostly features text for players to read with a few choices players can make which will lead to a Game Over or continue the story. The final choice will decide which of the two endings players will get to see.</p>\n<p>As for the plot, the game takes place in the 1920s in the USA. The protagonist, Charles finds out that his uncle Abner had died and left his mansion in Dunwich to his nephew, however, Charles has to move in to the Mansion for one month until the inheritance can take effect. As Charles and his wife stay in the mansion, he finds out more about his uncle's dark secrets.</p>",

Players take the role of the young archeologist Amy Goldberg, who is trying to get into an ancient pyramid in Egypt to uncover its secrets. Also, at times, they will control Arthur Zweistein, an aging German researcher who is also tasked with unveiling the secrets of the pyramid and who is the first to experience what the pyramid does to people. </p>\n<p>Players control both protagonists directly using direction keys. Players are sometimes hinted when they're close to usable objects and can trigger a menu where they can choose what they want to do with the objects. Players can pick up, combine and use items during their adventures. With the exception of the beginning of the game, which serves as a tutorial for players, the game takes place inside the pyramid, where players will need to solve various puzzles and riddles to progress through the tombs.</p>",

Players take control of Anna, who woke up in a mansion with no memories of who she is and how she got there. To make things worse, the mansion is full of ghosts and phantoms that will not hesitate to kill Anna. Armed with a candle, Anna goes to find a way out of the mansion, as well as clues that can restore her memory.</p>\n<p>Players will need to pick up and use objects in the right places to find keys that will allow Anna to progress through the mansion's. There is also a Ship puzzle that can be solved by finding 5 map pieces hidden in the rooms of the mansion. Anna is no warrior, thus, when she is confronted by enemies, they will grab on to her and and players will need to repeatedly tap a button to break free from the enemies. The only way to defeat enemies is to use traps on them. There are various traps for players to find and each trap takes time to work, thus, players need to plan out their attacks in advance and try not to let the enemies get too close to Anna.</p>",

In some levels, Jack will also find and be able to shoot enemies using a bow.

        "description": "<p><em>Turbo Camels: Circus Extreme</em> is a physics-based puzzle game.</p>\n<p>In this game, players control G\u00fcnther and his camel Baldwin, whose circus act consists of being shot out from a cannon and bounce around the stage collecting objects such as candy, bananas or pumpkins.</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is to collect a set amount of objects or all of them and reach the finish line. This is done by first setting the angle and how far players wish to shoot G\u00fcnther and Baldwin.</p>\n<p>After shooting them out of the cannon, bouncing will give the entertainers energy which players can use to boost the two characters into any direction.  </p>\n<p>This boost will be helpful when trying to get all the candies, as well as when trying to reach the finish line or avoiding traps such as elephants or pandas which make the entertainers less bouncy or bombs, jugglers and penguins which will kill the entertainers on contact. Some levels will also have levers that the entertainers must touch to open an area.</p>\n<p>Each level has a time limit to finish it and if the entertainers run out of time or energy and are not moving at all, the level is considered as failed. Some of the levels offer an extra challenge and give more points if certain conditions, such as not using boosters or limiting their use to a certain amount of times are met. There are even levels where players can fly out of bounds.</p>\n<p>There are 3 arenas to complete which consist of 5 stages (The first arena having an extra tutorial stage) and each stage is divided into 4 missions (With stage 3 from the second arena adding an extra mission).</p>\n<p>Each completed level increases the entertainer's fame and, to get the best result and win a prize, players must get all the objects, as well as complete each level fast enough to get a new High Score.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Spectrobes</em> is a Match 3 puzzle game for mobile phones based on the Spectrobes franchise. Rallen had his Prizmod stolen by space pirates and after finally recovering it he finds out that all but one of his Spectrobes are missing. Apparently, the space pirates have also allied themselves with the evil Krawl. With the help of Jeena he is off to defeat them and find the missing Spectrobes.</p>\n<p>In the campaign mode, the player can play two types of levels. These are Spectrobe levels and Krawl levels. In the Spectrobe levels several meters at the bottom of the screen have to be filled with the corresponding minerals in the playing field. The player has to match three identical minerals to fill them. To do this he has to pick an empty spot in the playing field and choose a direction to move it in. The entire row will then move in that direction. All the meters have to be filled before the time runs out.</p>\n<p>In the Krawl level the player has to fight a Krawl by matching three minerals. Some minerals will heal the player while others will slow the Krawls attack down or let the Spectrobe attack the Krawl. Along the way, the player will retrieve the missing Spectrobes. Before starting a level, the player can choose the Spectrobe he wants to use for the match. Between the levels the player has to use his spaceship to get from one level to another by maneuvering it in all four directions.</p>\n<p>Besides the campaign mode, the game offers the following modes:* Quick play</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Single match</li>\n<li>Survival</li>\n<li>Create a Level</li>\n</ul>",

This is done by going from left to right, doing the tricks that your agent tells you to do when prompted or by clearing the level with a set amount of points or more. Points are obtained when players land a trick and combining a few tricks will multiply their points for it.</p>\n<p>The game allows players to do ollies, nollies, flip tricks, grinds and manuals.</p>\n<p>There's also a Free Tour mode where players can choose any of the levels they've already completed and beat the highscore in them.</p>",

In this game, players assume the role of both Ezio and Alta\u00efr. Ezio's story takes place in Constantinople in 1511 A.D., where he is on a mission to retrieve the key to the lost Library of the Assassins. Alta\u00efr's story takes place in 1191 A.D. He seeks revenge on his master for betraying him for one of the Pieces of Eden.</p>\n<p>Gameplay includes mostly 2D side-scrolling platforming and defeating enemies with a sword. Enemies can be attacked directly or the player can try to take them by surprise and kill them with one move. Some levels are played from a top down perspective similar to a shoot 'em up game with Leonardo Da Vinci's flying machine.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The mobile version of <em>Marc Ecko's Getting Up</em> is a side-scrolling platformer where players control the urban graffiti artist Trane and help him build his reputation in the oppressed city of New Radius. However, with Civil Conduct Keepers machines on his trail, it won't be an easy task.</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is to collect spray cans that will illuminate the dark city. Then, when players find and pick up an X, they start tagging the area and that is also done by collecting spray cans. The level is considered complete as soon as players collect all the spray cans necessary to leave a tag. Then, the game calculates Trane's reputation based on the amount of spray cans Trane collected. This needs to be done while avoiding laser beams from security cameras and being out of sight of CCK flyers and helicopters.</p>\n<p>Trane can wall jump and do a ducking slide to get to areas that are impossible to access in the conventional way.</p>\n<p>Spray cans come in different colors:* Orange spray cans.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Red ones, which need to be picked up in a specific order.</li>\n<li>Blue ones which require Trane to stand beside them for a short time before they are picked up.</li>\n<li>Purple ones which start a timer as soon as the first one is picked up and must be picked up in a limited amount of time.</li>\n<li>Green ones which share the traits of the Red and purple ones.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are 27 levels with three difficulty modes for each level players will complete. Each consecutive difficulty level is unlocked after clearing the previous one.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Vampires Dawn: Deceit of Heretics</em> is a mobile game and a part of the popular German <em>Vampires Dawn</em> series.</p>\n<p>Unlike the PC games, this game models its combat after Tactical RPGs. Players can control a party of up to 4 characters and are able to attack enemies only if they are within their weapons and magic range. Blood acts as MP in this game for vampires, allowing players to use magic or suck the blood of human enemies in battle to restore it. As for the skeletons, their equivalent is soul power which can be replenished by killing enemies and human NPCs.</p>\n<p>In cities, apart from talking to NPCs and accepting side-quests from them, players can opt to transform humans into runes and objects that will aid them in battle, steal items from them (If they master the skill), as well as suck their blood. Sucking blood from humans will restore each Vampire's MP. Players can stop the blood sucking at any time to keep the human alive.</p>\n<p>Levelling up gives players talent points which they can spend on improving various types of skills, such as stealing, sucking blood, seeing hidden passages and things, raising stats and mastering new spells.</p>\n<p>The game starts off with players taking control of Lara, a little girl, whose mother urges her to run away from her father who turned into a vampire and is planning to kill both of them. Unfortunately for the girl, the vampire catches up to them and kills Lara's mother, but is interrupted by Vince Neras and his skeleton servants before he can kill his own daughter. Lara joins Vince in his fight against the human crusade, hoping to find her father, as well as her mother, whose corpse had gone missing.</p>\n<p>The lower end devices received a simplified port where the game is constantly in combat mode with the story unfolding through dialogues. In these versions, experience is given to the character who delivered the finishing blow to an enemy.</p>",

As matches are made, the player scores points, and the tiles are removed and replaced by other tiles falling from the top. Extra points are given for chain reactions and longer formations. The game is on time but matches increase the time bar and when it reaches the top a bonus is given.</p>",

Once dragon riders protected the world but after losing a war against the Empire they fanished and hid the last of the dragon eggs away. Now the empire and rebels are trying to find out where the last eggs are. The game starts with Durza, a dark wizard from the Empire cornering the elven princess Arya. He is after the dragon egg she is carrying but before capturing the elven princess she manges to teleport the egg far away. The egg is later found by a boy named Eragon. After the Empire has destroyed his village he and the dragon are off to take revenge on the Empire.</p>\n<p>In the game the player controls Eragon and has to beat-up the forces of the Empire with his sword. Eragon can also call upon his dragon Saphira for help. The dragon then burns the enemies on screen with her breath. Along the way potions for replenishing health can be found. In some section the player controls Saphira and has to burn enemies standing on towers while flying through the air.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The mobile version of <em>skate.</em> is a side-scrolling skateboarding game. In this game, players can do such tricks as ollies, manuals, wallrides, spin tricks, handplants and lip stalls, Indy and Kickflip, spine transfers, as well as a few types of grind tricks.</p>\n<p>When doing grinds or manuals, players will be repeatedly prompted to press Up or Down and failing to do that in time will make them bail and lose any points they could've gotten if they landed the trick or the combo they were trying to do.</p>\n<p>Successfully pulling off tricks and combos will fill in a meter that when half or completely full allows players to activate \"Footy Time\". This will slow down the speed of the skater and add a trail effect to the skater's movement. Footy time allows players to squeeze extra tricks while they are in the air.</p>\n<p>The game features two gameplay modes:<em> </em>Thrasher Mode*, where players complete various missions with the ultimate goal of winning the Thrasher Skater of the Year award.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Free Skate</em>, where players can skate to their hearts delight on the areas they've unlocked while playing through the Thrasher Mode.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As players beat the challenges of the Thrasher Mode, they will unlock Media Clippings in their Scrapbook and be able to see the records they've achieved during gameplay.</p>\n<p>In total, there are 12 Chapters to complete in the Thrasher Mode with 4 missions in each chapter taking place in 3 areas: Plaza, Halfpipe and Downtown.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ketsui: Kizuna Jigoku Tachi DX</em> is the first feature phone adaptation of the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/113600/ketsui-kizuna-jigoku-tachi/\">Ketsui: Kizuna Jigoku Tachi</a>. Like the original game, <em>Ketsui</em> features a dark post-apocalyptic setting. In a world ravaged by climate change, the arms dealer EVAC Industries has been stoking tension between world powers to fuel weapons sales. A secret UN squadron is deployed in a last-ditch effort to eliminate EVAC and bring some form of peace to the world. Players have a choice between two different ships; the slow-moving Tiger Schwert has a wide shot, while the fast-moving Panzer J\u00e4ger has a focused shot. Both ships feature a lock-on mode; by holding down the shot button, the player shoots a tightly focused laser and the player's support ships lock onto the nearest enemy, allowing the player to strafe while continuing to shoot.</p>\n<p>This adaptation features only three of the original game's five stages and simplified artwork, both of which were addressed in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/167925/ketsui-kizuna-jigoku-tachi-dx/\">Ketsui: Kizuna Jigoku Tachi DX</a> rerelease the next year.</p>",

Violet is the tallest of the orphans and can combine objects to create new contraptions; Klaus is the strongest of the orphans and an avid reader; and Sunny can fit into tight spaces that her siblings cannot due to her small size and can bite items with her four powerful teeth. The game contains five levels set in three locations.</p>",

His twin brother Valadorn has turned against him and is about to capture the Kingdom of Thorin. Starting from one remaining castle, allowing him to still recruit troops and earn gold, he must reclaim his lands and defeat the usurper.</p>\n<p>The game is divided over different missions where the player each time has to build up their army by conquering castles and townhouses, which produce gold and heal troops. Possible units vary from warriors and archers to mystical creatures such as lizard men, gollums and dragons. The goal of each level differs, but is usually seeking out a character, destroying everyone, or reaching a certain area. </p>\n<p>A skirmish mode allows players to challenge a friend in a 2-player battle.</p>",

The game is controlled with a single button. The submarine is rapidly descending if the button is not pressed. By pressing and holding the button, the player makes the submarine go up and controls it's height, a concept similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Flappy+Bird\">Flappy Bird</a> and countless other games. The game has no ending, and the goal is to get a high score.</p>",

In eight missions, players control soldiers of the American, British, Canadian and Polish armies during the Battle of Normandy in the summer of 1944. Every mission is a loose adaptation of a level from the console version. Gameplay is objective-based: a commanding officer gives orders that must be completed to finish the mission; markers indicate where the current objective lies. Orders might include attacking enemies, capturing machine gun nests, escorting tanks or defusing explosives. Gameplay mechanics are patterned after the console version: enemies can be targeted for higher accuracy, the player character can switch between standing and crouching positions and use the latter to take cover behind barriers, and health is replenished automatically if not attacked for a while.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Star Wars: Jedi Mind Tricks</em> is a match-three puzzle game based on the Star Wars license.</p>\n<p>Unlike in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5095/bejeweled-deluxe/\">Bejeweled</a> and similar titles, adjacent tokens on the board are not flipped but instead one token is thrown to the edge of the board, with the remaining tiles shifting accordingly. Matching three of the same removes them from the board, matching four removes the entire column or row and matching five gains the player an extra turn.</p>\n<p>Tokens include Force and Attack tokens that come in three colors: blue, green and red. Blue tokens favor Jedi, red tokens favor Sith and green ones work equally for both sides. Special tokens include crates that can be moved but not matched, thermal detonators that explode when thrown and remove all adjacent tokens, and bacta tanks which heal the player when matched.</p>\n<p>There are two types of game: challenge and battle. In challenges, the goal is to remove a given number of tokens of each color in a limited number of turns. Battles are duels against another character and are won by depleting the enemy of their health. This is done by removing attack tokens, but attacking reduces the Force rush meter. Removing Force tokens increases the Force rush meter, that when full, increases the damage multiplier. Attempting an illegal move that won't result in removed tokens also reduces the Force rush.</p>\n<p>The Force also comes into play with Force points. These surround the game board and are activated by throwing a token at them. Once three adjacent ones are activated, a Force wall forms. When another token is thrown against this wall, the player character's Force power is activated. The power is different for each character and either removes all tokens of a certain type in the area covered by the wall or changes their color or type. In addition, each character has a unique special skill that changes the rules in their favor.</p>\n<p>Besides a tutorial, the game consists of Campaign and Arcade modes. Campaign consists of a series of missions for each character (both challenges and battles) selected on a planet map. The campaign culminates in a battle against the player character's destined enemy. At the start, players can choose between Ahsoka Tano and Asajj Ventress. Further characters are unlocked by completing a campaign.</p>\n<p>Arcade modes allows single challenges, series of battles either in Arena or Survival mode (in the latter, health isn't restored after a battle) or a single battle against a chosen charater in Versus mode</p>",

The goal in each level is to reach the exit. To get there, Aragorn must defeat orcs, navigate ladders and jump gaps, evade falling rocks and find levers to open doors. He can also smash barrels that may reveal red or green potions. Red potions restore his health while green ones add charges to his \"elf cloak\" power which he can use to turn temporarily invisible. Mid-level checkpoints allow continuing after the loss of a life.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Black Ops Mobile</em> is the fourth <em>Call of Duty</em> game from Glu Mobile. Like its predecessors, it is a top-down 2D scrolling tie-in to a major series entry. It is however completely unrelated to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/49001/call-of-duty-black-ops/\">Black Ops</a> story-wise, sharing only its 1960s setting.</p>\n<p>The game is set in 1967 in Vietnam. The player primarily controls Sgt. Bennett, a member of the classified MACV-SOG unit, deployed on a mission to disrupt North Vietnamese supply lines. The game consists of 15 missions, some of which allow the player to control different characters. Assignments include patrols, attacks on enemy bases, or defending a position from an attack wave. The player's rifle automatically aims at enemies and requires only the fire button to be pressed. The player can also throw grenades, which are also automatically aimed after selecting them. Grenades are limited and must be restocked by collecting ammo boxes. Sand bags and other barriers can be used to take cover by moving in close to them. Like in the main entries in the series, health regenerates automatically after a while.</p>",
