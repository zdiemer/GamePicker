The gameplay is similar to the original game, but simplified. The game uses songs stored on the Zune device to create custom racing tracks for the player's vehicle with elements and gameplay matching the song structure. Unlike the original game there are no different characters to choose from or an ironmode. The vehicle can only collect blocks while dodging roadblocks. The available game modes are 'normal' (regular speed) and 'turbo' (faster speed). There is also a 'watch lightshow' mode as a music visualizer where no blocks need to be collected.</p>",
