It also makes full use of the X-Box's power.  Volumetric grass, accurate reflections, clothes that get dirty over the course of the game, snow that leaves footprints, then gradually turns to grass as you stomp on it, then gets covered again.</p>\n<p>Fever offers many game modes, including Season and Dynasty.  In Dynasty mode, you guide one or more teams through multiple seasons, managing every aspect of your team.  Rosters, positions, build the dream team that everyone fears.</p>",

Of course those are needed to progress in the ranking, but the game takes track of two different scores: the overall course record and media stunts in front of the press. Special events are sponsor races, in which the sponsors have to impressed during the whole race, and duels, in which the course progression of another snowboarder has to emulated and the point result surpassed. The game features a soundtrack of 150 songs along with the possibility to incorporate own music tracks.</p>",

There are ten missions per side, for a total of twenty missions. Missions range from destroying cars to picking up documents to rescuing people.</p>\n<p>The game sports a real-time damage modeling system, so cars will break apart depending on how much they are damaged. Hoods and doors will pop loose and fly off, glass will shatter and break, license plates will get knocked loose and swing from side to side before finally falling off. The environment can be damaged as well, with street carts falling to pieces and neon signs exploding into a shower of sparks. Each side starts with a default car, but both gain access to exclusive new rides as they complete missions or by finding and touching hidden cars during levels.</p>",

Freedom is a valuable commodity and freedom of expression even more so. Gangs of misbehaving teens strap on rocket-powered roller blades and skate, grind, and mark their territory with graffiti tags.</p>\n<p>Players take the role of the GGs, and can choose between any member of the gang, each with different stats, while in gang HQ. The city of Tokyo can be leisurely explored without a time limit, but the heat will be turned up when story missions are activated and the GGs find themselves being challenged by rival gangs or under attack from the cops. This time around spraying no longer requires thumbstick inputs; just roll up and start spraying away, although large tags still require more cans than smaller tags. Each section of the city has hidden objectives that are revealed by finding a hidden tape, and once completed these challenges will unlock new graffiti patterns.</p>\n<p>In multiplayer modes players can challenge each other to races, point battles, and other competitions both in zones from the single player game as well as in special arenas.</p>",

Players take the role of Arran, a novice wizard whose magical power grows as he ages throughout his quest to collect spells and rid the world of eternal night.</p>\n<p>Players can choose brute force or smart tactics. Each school of magic is effective against a different color of enemy, and different schools will have spells with different effects as they level up. The schools are made up of over 40 spells, either light, dark, fire, or water. Spells can either be summoned right in front of Arran, or, by dislodging the magic stone on his staff and guiding it around him with the right thumbstick, fired with precision in any direction. Many items can be found hidden in levels that will provide Arran with bonuses, like increased health or the ability to power up a spell, and these bonuses carry between levels.</p>",

You can also download items in the future, such as additional Mechs and weapons, all handled through the Xbox interface.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Steel Battalion</em> is a 'mech game in which the player takes control of mechanized tanks, known as \"VT\"s (or Vertical Tanks), using a forty button controller with footpedals.</p>\n<p>Not too far in the future, military unrest is rampant throughout the world, and the player has just recently been promoted. As the pilot of a state-of-the-art mech known as a Vertical Tank, the player must take charge of keeping the peace. Players must master the integrated controller to clear their way to victory.</p>\n<p><em>SB</em> comes packaged with a forty button controller, consisting of three separate boards, and a footpedal. On the controller there are buttons that activate commands such as switching radio frequencies, activating the windshield wipers, changing radar scanners, switching weapons, firing weapons, locking abilities, defense mechanisms, and more. The controller has two joysticks, one which moves the 'mech forward and backward, and one that allows the player to move and aim. The footpedal controls speed and braking, independent of the stick, and a third pedal controls slide-strafe.</p>\n<p>An interesting feature is that of the eject button. Encased in clear plastic, similar to an \"abort\" button at a military installation, this command can save the player's life. As the player nears death they must quickly flip the lid and push the button, otherwise they die, and death in the game is forever, as the pilot data is erased from the hard drive/memory unit, forcing players to start over.</p>\n<p>To defeat enemy mechs the player is equipped with a variety of high-tech weapons, such as Plasma Torches, Twin Pod Rocket Launchers, and a 270mm Rifle Cannon.</p>\n<p>There are a total of fifteen 'mechs to pilot, and ten missions to accomplish.</p>",

When you first play the game, the new character, Lisa, introduces you to a few aspects, and joins you for your first volleyball match. All matches are two-on-two, with the first team to seven being the winner.</p>\n<p>Each day is comprised of four sections; morning, day, evening, and nighttime. There are several different areas you can visit; separate beaches and jungles to challenge different teams, an accessory shop, where you can buy accessories such as sunglasses, a sporting shop where you can buy new bikini's, a store called \"Zack of all Trades\" where you can buy miscellaneous items, such as a gun, lipstick, lotion, etc., a radio station, where you can select what soundtracks to listen to, or listen to your own, and the hotel, where each day ends.</p>\n<p>Once nighttime comes around, you can visit the casino. Once there, you can play one of four games; Blackjack, Poker, Roulette, or Slots. Playing games can earn you money, but can also strip you of money.</p>\n<p>There is a large variety of items to collect, and some items you must buy to entice someone to join your team. If a character's favorite color is black and her hobbies include cars, then you would buy them a black steering wall to pursuade them to join you.</p>\n<p>Volleyball matches earn you money (if you win) and consist of three basic moves; serve, spike, receive. If you lose too many games, you're partner may ditch you. Win enough and her loyalty will increase.</p>\n<p><em>XBV</em> includes a multiplayer feature that lets you play against a friend.</p>",

The storyline is made out of the normal forces of good vs. evil which takes place in China. Unlike other fighting games, Tao Feng features torn clothes, bruises and the most original feature which is limb damage.\nLimb damage happens when you block too much, or when you collide with one of the hazards in the environment. Those with limb damage will have their attacks decreased by 50%. The same thing goes for the legs except they can't run. </p>\n<p>Fighters can also use the enviroment to their advantages, example fighters can flip off the walls, swing on poles or throw opponents through glass. Each fighter also has powerful CHI attacks which can be devastating on enemies and the surroundings.</p>",

Paris is the more open ended city, great for beginners, while Washington features lots of narrow streets, sharp and hairpin turns, and various other distractions.</p>\n<p>There are over thirty licensed vehicles to choose from, from a Lotus Esprit Turbo to a real-life garbage truck. Each vehicle has it's own different characteristics, including speed, handling and acceleration.</p>\n<p>Over Xbox Live, you can compete in a variety of games:</p>\n<p>Capture The Gold -- Similar to Capture The Flag.  </p>\n<p>Hunter -- Two players are cops, while the rest are normal vehicles. When a cop rams you, you become a cop. The last person left to be pulled over is the winner.  </p>\n<p>Tag -- Same thing as the childhood game. One car is \"it\", while the others have to avoid him.</p>\n<p><em>Midtown Madness 3</em> supports voice, and allows you to download various content.</p>",

        "description": "<p><strong>Dino Crisis 3</strong> is the third game in the <em>Dino Crisis</em> series, and this time, it's futuristic.</p>\n<p>The year is 2548. The colonist spaceship Ozymandias, which disappeared over 300 years ago, suddenly reappears, with no warning or reason to it's disappearance. Attempting to contact the ship results in nothing. The Interstellar Fleet Commander sends out the Special Operations and Reconnaissance (SOAR) squadron to investigate. Their shuttle is destroyed by a merciless and unknown assailant. Everyone manages to survive, and reach the ship intact. What they encounter is something they never would've thought of.</p>\n<p>As Patrick, the leader of SOAR, you are tasked with exploring the ship, putting the pieces together, and rescuing any survivors you can find. The ship you are on, the Ozymandias, is a dynamically changing structure, which enables you to move hallways and re-position doors so that you can access new areas all the time.</p>\n<p>During your search, you'll have to battle a number of various dinosaurs, from Raptors to the terrible Tyrannosauras Rex. Luckily, you have a variety of weapons at your disposal, from standard firearms and shotguns to sophisticated laser and beam-guided rifles. You may also find and use Wasps; little robotic bee-shaped critters that can attack enemies or open doors and other devices.</p>\n<p>To aid you, you are equipped with a jetpack that you can use at any time to hover or speed through areas. It may also be used when in a tense firefight, taking the battle to the air. Many dodging and evading techniques are possible with the use of the jetpack.</p>\n<p>Like the second game, <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/p,6/gameId,3625/\">Dino Crisis 2</a>, you are awarded points for every dinosaur you kill. Kill some in rapid succession, you'll earn more points and double them as well. With enough points, you can buy new weapons, ammo, and health items at various terminal stations scattered throughout the ship.</p>\n<p>With the aid of three of your best crew, find the survivors, figure out what the hell happened, and most importantly, get off the ship before you become dino dinner.</p>",

Many real snowboarding tricks are including, from Indy's and Mute's to Stalefish's and Tailgrabs. Specific to the sequel are kick flips and shove it's, as well as the ability to link tricks together via \"butter\", similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/58784/tony-hawk/\">Tony Hawk</a>'s manual.</p>\n<p>The career mode has you starting out as a level 250 nobody. It's your job to rise the ranks and fight your way to number one in the world. Challenges consist of beating a high score, beating media challenges, performing certain tricks in one run, finding and clearing all the gaps, and knocking down eight snowmen, who taunt you and laugh at you. When you're done with the normal goals, and your player is high enough, you can attempt Sponsor Goals and Photo Shoots, to earn new equipment and further unlock the mountain. Some sponsors may like rails, so you'll have to use just rails to impress them. The photo shoot has you performing tricks to get a set score while going through various rings on a set area of the mountain.</p>\n<p>Once you're finished with single player, you can go online via Xbox Live to play with other people. Your stats will be tracked and you can view your ranking, other player rankings, and where you stand at XSNSports.com. Compete in races, stunt events, or just cruise the mountain.</p>",

Players can use standard platforming attacks, like a spin and a head dive, but also have magic voodoo at their disposal. To use voodoo, the player hurts themself, thereby hurting their enemies. Players may pull out a big magnet that causes a debris of heavy metal objects to squash them, killing nearby enemies, or they can summon a UFO to attack them with laser blasts.</p>\n<p>Each level is littered with different pickups that not only assist players but will allow them to reach 100% completion. Picking up skulls will add another voodoo icon, letting the player use more voodoo powers. Other items will extend the health bar or provide certain powerups.</p>\n<p>Madame Charmaine needs you!

The game is set in the future. Tokyo, Japan's capital, was destroyed in a nuclear explosion early in the 21th century. But some years later the Tokyo of the nineties was digitally recreated. People live in a virtual world, and everything is ruled by computer programs. But some programs don't work correctly, and one day, a pop concert is disrupted by a terrible demonic vision. A special agency recruits the hero of the game, Kei (which can be either female or male, depending on your choice), to travel through the virtual world and to confront the hackers who might pull the strings behind the scene.</p>\n<p>Like in all Megaten games, demon summoning plays an important part in \"Nine\". You can have several parties, up to eight characters each, and form them at your wish from the demons you manage to recruit. Talking to enemies is even more important now, as you get experience points from equipping items and not from battles. You can also fuse demons to get more powerful ones. The battles are now in real time, both parties attack simultaneously, and precise timing is required. In addition, some portions of the game are occupied by virtual battles between hackers, which resemble a strategy board game.</p>",

There's no storyline: it's all about becoming the best driver of the world by finishing first in races through famous cities, such as Chicago, Edinburgh, Florence, Barcelona, Washington, Hong Kong and Moscow.</p>\n<p>The kudos system, which awards points based on driving style, has been improved. Perform power slides, 360\u00b0 turns, drive on two wheels or stay in the slipstream of your opponents to build up a stash. With those points, you can unlock new venues and faster race monsters, such as the Ferrari Enzo, Porsche GT2, BMW Z4, Pontiac GTO, Mini Cooper S and many others.</p>\n<p>The game can be played both over System Link or Xbox Live. You can race friends online or download ghosts of the fastest drivers all around the world to improve your own skills.</p>\n<p>Each city has its own soundtrack, but you can create and store your own playlists as well.</p>",

Prize money and prices have been modified as well, and new tracks, including a facsimile of Laguna Seca, reverse tracks, and races set in the morning, evening, and night, have been added to the returning races.</p>\n<p>The player can jump right in the action by selecting a car, from a Chevelle to a Fiat, then a track location, from an American desert to a European village. In addition to the returning Chronicles mode there is also now a Gathering mode with 30 check point, license test, and racing line challenges. As with Chronicles each completed challenge unlocks a car for purchase in GT 2002 mode.</p>\n<p>Online, players could participate in races with other human players, or trade parts with them.

Rhama finds out that the ship was used to transport rare healing herbs and contains the clues for finding them and bringing them to the healer. But at this point everything goes wrong. Rhama and Areliano are betrayed, and soon the Captain finds himself on the run; but that doesn't mean that he abandons the quest. Aided by Faith, Areliano's lovely daughter, and other friends he meets on his journey, Rhama is determined to bring the betrayer to justice and deliver the ship's legacy to the right hands.</p>\n<p><em>Galleon</em> is a 3D action game with platforming elements, created by the designers of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/348/tomb-raider/\">Tomb Raider</a>. Like in most other games of this kind, most of the gameplay is dedicated to jumping and climbing, with some combat thrown in. However, <em>Galleon</em> includes many less typical elements. Rhama possesses extraordinary acrobatic skills and can run on walls and perform very long jumps. The game has an unusual control scheme, which makes Rhama respond to the amount of pressure the player applies to the analog stick, allowing various and precise combinations of running and jumping, including the possibility to influence character movement during free fall. </p>\n<p>Further stand-out features include cooperation between characters (similarly to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5158/ico/\"> ICO</a>, though Rhama has two female companions), treasure hunt system (Rhama can use his pirate senses to discover hidden treasures), and boss battles that require climbing on the enemies to destroy them, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/19875/shadow-of-the-colossus/\"> Shadow of the Colossus</a>-style.</p>",

This is not a simple extension of the first game. There are a lot of new missions, vehicles (mechs, tanks, and whatever else the player can find), and worlds to explore. Jump in and let's go for a ride.</p>\n<p>The game adds new gameplay elements to the system used in <em>MechAssault</em>. In the original game, the player was a Mech pilot and nothing else. Here, the player is the only pilot in the game world. This means that the player can now get out of a Mech and drive someone else's Mech. Want to drive a tank or some of the other vehicles? Well, now it is possible. Jump in many of the vehicles and take one for a ride. Of course, the Battlemech still rules the field.</p>\n<p>Like the original game, Xbox Live is fully supported for multiplayer gaming.</p>",

Starting as a subordinate, Sho quickly becomes the leader of a special squadron of soldiers that will use all its power to stop the muton invasion.</p>\n<p><em>Crimson Sea</em> is a mission-based action game set in a distant future. In some cases, you can choose yourself the order in which you want to tackle the missions. Some of the missions have a time limit. Sho will encounter hordes of mutons and battle ferocious muton bosses. He can find and attach various upgrades to his custom weapon that allow new attacks. He also uses \"neo-psyonic powers\", which work pretty much like magic spells. There are slight role-playing elements in the game: it is possible to buy weapons, weapon upgrades, and items in stores, and weapons can gain experience points when continuously used in battles.</p>",

However, the prototype can't be designed individually - the player has to choose between between three designs per build. These differ in speed, brakes and acceleration. To keep with the theme, the player races to improve the sales figures, which serve the same purpose as ranking points in other action racers. High enough sales unlock new prototypes and car classes (roadster, speedsters, supercars and dreamcars). The game features 50 courses, various race categories and sometimes special challenges to solve.</p>\n<p>Additionally to this dream mode, there is an arcade mode (single races) which can be played against another player.</p>",

The game is different than the first as players take control of the Time Sweepers and mastering time. The Tom Tom Gang control space. However, the player does not play as Blinx. The time limit is also gone from each level. The game is more of an action game rather than a platform game. Artoon's game has expanded into non-traditional platform territories and plays more like a light-weight action game. The player has a huge arsenal of gadgets and weapons. The switch between the two teams is a new experience.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Iron Phoenix is a Wuxia/Hong Kong Cinema style fighting game that allows Xbox Live battles with up to 16 players. The fighting system is based on the weapon and character selection, allowing hundreds of move combinations.</p>\n<p>In the distant past, a meteorite fell to earth (the \"Iron Phoenix\") and was forged into seven powerful magical weapons by a master weaponsmith. They proved to be his doom, however, as the World of Martial Arts is nothing if not unkind to those without the power to protect what is theirs.</p>\n<p>Combatants choose from 10 character models, each of which has 2 variations. There are also a variety of monster and undead models that can be used. Each character has different configurations of strength, speed and health, affecting their performance in a fight. These characters are combined with weapons (sometimes pre-selected, sometimes grabbed in a free-for-all during a fight) to allow for a wide variety of play styles.</p>\n<p>The weapons are: Phoenix Wings (Hand Blades), Searing Dagger, Ember Sword (Longsword), Phoenix Tail (Long Spear), Ash Blade (Scimitar), Meteor Hammer, Flame of Heaven (2-Handed Sword), Phoenix Talons (Hand Claws), and the Feather Blade (Ninja-to sword). Players can also pick up a variety of darts which can poison or slow a target, in addition there is a variety of equipment that can grand special powers, such as increased strength, invisibility, and movement.</p>\n<p>Movement in the game is based in the wire-fu, with leaps, flips, wall-running, etc. A move power meter governs this aspect of play, recharging over time.</p>\n<p>The game is all-combat, all the time, either single player or Xbox Live. Single players can go up against a custom build out of bots, in a variety of game modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, VIP, Giant Kill, and Challenge Ring. These modes are available online as well, allowing up to 16 simultaneous players to engage in high-flying martial arts battles with exotic weaponry on Xbox Live.</p>",

There are 30 tracks and over 230 cars with a unique feel that can be modified to the smallest details, from spoilers to decals, and the option to create your own shapes with 100 different layers for a single car. Every single part influences the car behaviour - even the G-forces are taken into account, with a realistic damage model.</p>\n<p>The game modes include a career mode with different classes, time trials, free runs and arcade races. In the career mode, winning races unlocks manufacturer relationships and you can earn money to buy new cars or customize your vehicles. This mode is expanded over Xbox Live with human opponents.</p>\n<p>Forza also includes Drivatar technology, where you can train the computer AI to copy your driving skills (the way you approach corners, the amount of brake applied) and then let the AI race for you to move quickly past certain courses. Over Xbox Live, you can organize your own competitions, start a car club with a team of drivers, exchange cars, download ghost cars to improve your race times, compete on over 1400 leaderboards and acquire new car setups.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Far Cry Instincts</em> is an Xbox remake of the original Far Cry PC shooter, but with many changes and enhancements by Ubisoft Montreal, who collaborated with Crytek on this title. The main storyline has not been changed: you are still the charter-boat businessman Jack Carver, who is suddenly attacked while escorting journalist Valerie Cortez to a tropical island. While rescuing Valerie, you get revenge on the soldiers and scientists, and investigate the strange events on the island.</p>\n<p>The Xbox version is true to the original, but adds small twists to the plot (already in the opening scenes) and enhances the game with new gameplay elements. Jack has both offensive and defensive attacks. He can use boats, gliders, water scooters, ATV's and even a hovercraft to move around, and the weapons range from a butterfly knife to rocket launchers. While sneaking, you can use backstab, or branch whips and claymore mines as traps.</p>\n<p>New gameplay elements for the Xbox version are introduced when you are injected by doctor Richard Crowe. His serum gives you predator-like abilities. By killing enemies, resting, or taking physical damage, an adrenaline meter is filled, which can be used to activate feral abilities that enhance your instincts (hence the title) such as feral speed (extreme movement), feral vision (much like night vision), feral smell (trace enemies by odour) and feral strength to blast through doors.</p>\n<p>There are extensive multiplayer options, from split-screen behind a single console to system link with up to 16 consoles connected. Also on Xbox Live, the following modes are available:<em> </em>Chaos*: FFA with a fraglimit.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Team Chaos</em>: TDM with a fraglimit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Steal the Sample</em>: CTF where the player carrying the stolen sample cannot shoot, but is allowed to toss it to a team mate and then use a weapon.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Predator</em>: Predators versus a group of mercenaries. The mercs need to activate a transmitter triggering a sonic alarm that kills the creatures. The predators on the other hand (no more than two per game) have a complete set of skills including feral abilities, regeneration and unlimited respawns, while the mercs remain dead when killed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A map editor has been included as well. You can create, edit and save maps, and then share them with friends.</p>",

Now it's used for a sport called Rumbling, which is a brutal, action filled sport and the stars are customised mecha-like machines which battle against each other in arenas made exclusively for the sport. Little by little, the sport got a foothold and now is one of the most successful things in entertainment.  </p>\n<p>There is a story mode, which sees the player fight her way through the ranks of opponents, each one a bit harder than previous. She must use the credits won from the battles to soup up the mech with different parts and weapons. One can also choose the coloring of her mech which adds to the uniquity of each fighting machine.\nMissiles fly and explosions shatter the ground as these huge metal monsters take on each other both outside and inside buildings, and also the time of day changes so the battle could take place during the day or night. Once in a while, player has to battle a boss and earn some sweet rare parts if it is defeated. \nThere is also multiplayer with 2-4 players fighting in split-screen mode.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This is the console version of America's Army: Operations., the U.S. Army's free \"recruitment tool\" for computers. As in the original, the single-player campaign simulates a soldier's true Army career from boot camp all the way to the Special Forces. Most of the game's missions involve real-world situations today, and the game uses authentic Army weapons and equipment. The 35 unconnected missions are divided into five missions for each class.</p>\n<p>Since the game was developed with the professional advice of actual Special Forces soldiers, it is realistic and forces the player to follow authentic Army tactics. If players use a run-'n-gun approach to the gameplay, they can easily get killed on the battlefield. In multiplayer, the player's experience points determine which class he is able to take. </p>\n<p>There are two major changes to this console version. The \"build-a-soldier\" feature allows the player to fully customize a soldier by changing his name, nickname, face, and even his homestate. Experience points, which are earned at the end of each mission for performing well, can be spent improving the soldier's seven abilities. The experience from multiplayer and single player are separate.</p>",

The game features a fully animated polygonal crowd, tons of motion-captured animations, NHL licensed players, teams and arenas. The look and feel of the game are much different than games like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/42/ea-sports-nhl-series/\">EA's NHL series</a>.</p>\n<p>This was also the first hockey game on Xbox that let players play in online tournaments and leagues over Xbox Live and XSN Sports. Rosters were updated as the season went on via content downloads over Xbox Live, though were only available for a limited time.</p>\n<p>Rivals 2004 features the gameplay mode of 3-on-3 pond hockey. This pickup-game style of play is meant for those who prefer instant action, and it can also be played over Xbox Live. Players can connect and join in on a recreational game intended to simulate the fun pickup games that many people played as kids.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is arcade-like, with fast play and quick passing via a button or in specific directions using the analog stick.</p>",

You play as a mutant super-soldier resembling Master Chief, wearing the military's new \"Sentinel\" suit that makes him stronger, auto-heals him, and targets enemies. A group of terrorists have managed to find out about the Sentinel suits, and have kidnapped a scientist that helped develop the suits. You must destroy the terrorists and make sure that the Sentinel technology does not fall into the wrong hands.</p>\n<p>As with many other budget-priced shooters on the market, the gameplay in <em>Classified: The Sentinel Crisis</em> is very similar to that of the <em>Halo</em> games. Most notably, the auto-healing system is similar to <em>Halo</em>'s \"shields\" system.</p>",

Where the original game was an offline single-player campaign only, this game conversely offers only an online multiplayer mode with no single-player experience.</p>\n<p>The original Steel Battalion game came with a unique and expensive controller sporting 40 buttons, 2 joysticks, three foot-pedals, and a gear-shift. In the US, Line of Contact does not come bundled with the controller so purchase of the original game is required for play. In Europe, you can either buy the game or a bundle that includes both the controller and the first game. In Japan, you can buy the game or a bundle with the controller included.</p>\n<p>Online play is provided by Xbox Live and features four online modes: campaign, battle royale, capture the container, and conquest. Campaign mode (the primary mode for obtaining new mechs) divides combatants into one of four factions: Pacific Rim Forces, Hai Shi Dao, Right Brothers, and Jaralaccs Mercenary.</p>",

Your weapons don't need to be reloaded, and switching from weapon to weapon is very quick (no weapon switching animations), a nod to the original <em>Quake</em>. You can collect souls from your fallen enemies to gain health, and collecting 66 souls will turn you into an invincible demon that can instantly kill his enemies with a screen-blurring projectile. If you do well, you'll even be rewarded with power-ups in the form of tarot cards.</p>",

The player character advances automatically, the screen scrolling forward and often changing the camera view. The path is not entirely linear: at certain intersections, the player can choose where to go next. The game encompasses six large levels; regular enemies, mid-bosses, and end bosses will try to do everything in their might to foil Drake's mission.</p>\n<p>Drake's ship has two primary weapons, which can be switched at any time. One is a spread attack normally used against small enemies; the other is a concentrated laser that's effective against bigger targets. Both weapons also have an alternate firing mode, homing missiles. All these can be upgraded during the course of the game. Collecting power-ups not only strengthens the weapons, but allows the ship to perform various offensive and defensive manoeuvres.</p>\n<p>The game is story-driven; animated cutscenes appear between the levels, advancing the plot.</p>",

Like the Gold Edition, it features levels from both <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3512/serious-sam-the-first-encounter/\">first</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5623/serious-sam-the-second-encounter/\">second</a> chapters; the weapons from the second part can be used when playing the levels of the first one as well. The levels are generally somewhat smaller than in the PC release. </p>\n<p>The most significant change comes in the form of a life system. Scoring 100,000 points grants the protagonist an additional life, allowing him to respawn at the same place after having been killed, rather than forcing the player to return to the last checkpoint. Combo points are awarded for executing specific attacks rapidly, contributing to the overall score. The save system has been somewhat modified, with telephone booths representing checkpoints.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Sometime in year 2086 all extreme sports have been banned including skateboarding, BMX, surfing, rollerblading, and scooters. This banning has forced a major television company to create a reality TV show involving racing bikes for your life coined \u201cToxic Grind\u201d. During this time all of the racers get killed off so the network builds a time machine to recruit some new riders from the past. You play as Jason Hayes, BMX star of the 20th century who is kidnapped and pumped with toxic chemicals insuring you do all the cool tricks to your ability on the game show or your insides will internally combust. You ride a bike, performing tricks to complete missions to advance through the stages of the game. You also have to do battle with your toxic meter which increases if you give a sloppy performance and decreases when you're excelling with your performance. </p>\n<p>Multiplayer modes include Quick Draw, Score War, Turf War, and Tug of War(in which players each start with a certain amount of points and do tricks to take the other players points away.)</p>",

The only ones with the power to produce such beings are the Gods of Magic, a group of sorcerers who have been captured and put into a trance so that their powers can be harvested for this end. However, the have started to awaken and now they are using these Weapon Monsters to wreak vengeance on those who kidnapped them. Their ultimate goal is the total destruction of the earth. You and your band of mercenaries are the only ones who can stop them.</p>\n<p>Create a team by naming characters, assigning one of five classes, and changing their facial and body type as well the color of their equipment. You can create as many team-members as you wish, but only take five into battle. Journey into the ever-changing levels of the research facility, gaining weapons, armor, levels, and spells along the way to do battle against the Weapon Monsters, the Gods of Magic, and their minions and retake the facility.</p>\n<p>Battles are fought in real-time turn-based combat similar to the <em>Final Fantasy</em> ATB style, but with a twist. Party members will perform assigned actions without any input until their actions are changed by the player. Several special classes can be unlocked by using special items and each class has weapons and spells unique to it. Also, if a party member falls in battle it is possible to add a new one by finding a fresh body in special preservation rooms scattered throughout the facility.</p>\n<p>Each level of the facility is randomly generated and changes when you leave. This security measure cannot be overridden. Find items, weapons and armor in chests littered about the compound, but be warned that some chests have traps which must be disarmed first (if you don't want to suffer the consequences). There is a Weapon Monster lurking somewhere on each level which must be defeated in order to move on to the next level. Eventually you must battle the Gods of Magic and seal the Demon Lord up.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Pulse Racer</em> is a racing game set in 2024 in futuristic vehicles that resemble karts. They have weaponry power-ups, where the car is linked directly to the driver, allowing the player to speed up at the cost of the character's heart rate and to race on life energy instead of fuel. Included are quick race, time trial, career, and multiplayer modes. Also of interest is the INFINITRAX system, which generates custom tracks that can be saved on the hard disk. While progressing through the game the game, more and more sliders are unlocked, allowing heavier customization of the maps.</p>\n<p>Some of the weapons are mines, plasma beams and missiles. When the vehicle is stressed because of consistently using the unlimited speed boost, the character will have a heart attack and flatline. They then need to stop for a short moment to recover. Characters are visible inside the vehicles. By pulling the characters you can make the characters shoot beams that attach themselves to orbs around the track. That way they can grab onto poles to propel themselves forward or to take sharper corners. Most of the turning is also done by having the characters lean.</p>\n<p>There are nine vehicles and fifteen tracks, and up to four players can compete offline on a split screen.</p>",

The most important mode however is the Circuit Mode which is basically a career: the player starts with a few credits and tries to become the most successful driver. There are five leagues which want to be won. Of course the player receives prize money after accomplishments which is reinvested into upgrade his car or buying a new one altogether. Besides the races there are two additional ways to receive rewards: Line-In races (following the shown ideal line) for money and Head-to-Head races against a single opponent for a new car.</p>\n<p>The game features 20 courses in three locations: Shibuya (a district of Tokyo), Surfer's Paradise (a Australian harbor region) and Monaco.

        "description": "<p>Having already freed Hong Kong from the grip of the Yakuza in their <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5767/wreckless-the-yakuza-missions/\">last game</a>, the Dragons of the Hong Kong Police Force fly to America to hand Tiger Takagi off to the CIA. Unfortunately Takagi is barely on American soil for five minutes before his Yakuza cronies spring him, and this time it's up to the Dragons alone to put him behind bars for good.</p>\n<p><em>Double S.T.E.A.L: The Second Clash</em> has the same reckless vehicular smashing action of the first game, but this time set in the American city of Chicago. Missions can have varied objectives such as destroying a number of Yakuza targets or getting to a point in the city while being hounded by Yakuza cars. Missions have far more generous time limits compared to the first game, but they are also now rated, and earning a high rating on a mission with a quick time can unlock Extra Missions and cars. Most cars can earn multiple turbo boosts by destroying property and traffic, and if the boost bar is maxed out then it will be expelled all at once and stop time as well.</p>\n<p>The free mode of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/48159/wreckless-the-yakuza-missions/\">PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions of Wreckless</a> makes a return, allowing Madoka and Mei to drive around the city without worrying about objectives or time limits. Boxes of car parts can be found hidden around Chicago, and for every five boxes found a new car will be unlocked. Extra Missions can be found as well that have non-Yakuza related objectives, such as winning a dirt race, reaching checkpoints, or delivering pizza in time.</p>",

His skills from the games, and his Exaskeleton, are the only things that can protect him now.</p>\n<p><em>Exaskeleton</em> is a linear mech-combat game. Each mission in the game is book-ended by long, talking-head dialogue scenes between the various members of Joe's party. Before each mission the model of Joe's (as well as allies, if available) frame can be selected, either the nimble and weak Light Frame, the armored and slow Heavy Frame, or the in between Middle Frame. Two weapon slots are taken up by small arms, either a pistol, machine gun, or grenades, while the other two slots are taken up by more powerful weapons, like missile launchers, sniper riffles, and Gatling guns, with the most powerful only able to be equipped by a Heavy Frame. Weapons have limited ammo and overheat if fired continuously. Each body part of a frame is armored, and after the armor on a part is destroyed any additional damage to that part will damage the frame itself, until eventually the frame is destroyed.</p>",

Several AWGS models can be chosen for each mission, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. AWGS are equipped with a long range rifle, vulcan canon, short range missile barrage, and long range guided missiles, and each can be selected from different available models. Missions take place in and around Burma, and have varied objectives such as defending a base or destroying a supply convoy.</p>",

In comparison to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tom+Clancy's+Ghost+Recon+2\">PlayStation 2</a> version, the gameplay mechanics stay the same, but the storyline (which takes place in 2011 instead of 2007) and the 15 levels are different.</p>\n<p>The gameplay has been simplified in comparison to its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5557/tom-clancys-ghost-recon/\">predecessor</a>. While the player is still in command of a squad for most missions, he no longer sets way points to the individual soldiers. Instead he simply moves the cursor to a location and activates a context-sensitive command list or gives general movement commands. There is only one squad instead of two and the player can't switch to another squad member.</p>\n<p>The gameplay itself mostly involves shooting enemies, but it is important to find out the correct tactical approach for every encounter. This is made easier with the save system which allows to save at every time.\nThe standard playing perspective is third-person, but it can be changed to the first-person view known from the other games in the series.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Magi Death Fight</em> is a top-down action game. There are two game modes: a single-player/cooperative campaign and multiplayer deathmatch mode, supporting up to four players. The game takes place in an arena. Four different color balls of magic energy float around randomly in the arena, and can be picked up and fired at your foes. By holding down the fire button you can control how far the ball shoots. The balls do no damage until the end of their travel, at which point they explode, damaging whatever is beneath them.</p>\n<p>You can pick up in total four balls of energy to orbit your character before you can pick up no more. If you collect all of one color, then this charges up your blast to be much more powerful than simply your regular fired ball. For example, a full four blue water magics will cause a stream of water to be released at the end of your shot, flowing down the screen from that point through all walls and obstacles and hitting everything underneath its path. If you collect one of each color, then this will cause you to release an 8-way explosion of regular shots careening randomly in every direction. There's also chests scattered randomly around the battlefield, and inside are various power-ups (as well as power-downs) that affect your character in various ways: speed boost, homing shots, guided shots, etc.</p>",

It was released for Xbox a year after the original PC (Windows) game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Aoi+Namida\">with the same title</a>. While the first print release known as <em>Shokaiban</em> (\u521d\u56de\u7248) includes the original soundtrack as well, there is no regular release of this game for Xbox. Unlike the original game for PC, all the adult graphical content has been removed from this port despite the fairly high rating on the cover. Additionally, this release features full voice-acting while the original PC release did not have any.</p>\n<p>The story takes place in a several different worlds, each set in a single volume of a story. Initially, the game starts in the Fantasy Volume of the story. It then shifts to Reminiscence Volume, and finally ends with the Modern Volume. The main heroines are introduced individually throughout the story during the Fantasy Volume where player can chose to pursue a romantic affection with one of the heroines. Based on player's interest in a specific heroine, the Reminiscence Volume will reflect a different story of the past, ultimately concluding the story in the Modern Volume showing the present-day of the story. New characters appear in different volumes of the story.</p>",

While the game in itself plays very much like a whimsical and cartoony kart racer, it includes several elements not seen in other kart racing games, such as the usage of a aluminum bat to knock off enemies, which impacts your karma meter and is used in how other racers will treat you in future races, this can be countered with apologizing. There's also a trick system, if used correctly, can give you a temporary speed boost. Typical kart racing powerups such as speed boosts and rockets can be used to stall or slow down other racers. </p>\n<p>There are two multiplayer modes that can be played up to 4 players on the Xbox system, such as the \"classic\" mode, which is the base single player game and \"Jam\" mode, where players must acquire a CD and hold onto it for a limited time to be declared the winner.</p>",

The ground underneath the land is filled with ruins, treasures, and monsters, just waiting to be found. Luckily, he's armed with his trusty drill ready to explore the earth.</p>\n<p>The core of Dunk's journey is digging. While underground, players can hold down the R trigger to rev up their drill and start drilling through dirt or stone. There are no preset maps and no pre-made tunnels: players make their own paths, digging in whatever direction they please. Their tunnels are persistent and will always stay in exactly the same position between play sessions, allowing players to slowly build an extensive tunnel network over time. Dunk will slowly get more tired over time as he digs, but luckily he can carry a supply of his favourite booze, \"beev\", with him; taking a swig of beev helps him recover his strength, and he can always refresh his supply of beev back at town.</p>\n<p>Hidden throughout the world are tombs, filled with treasures - but also monsters. If Dunk runs into these, he can explore them to collect whatever treasures he finds while defending himself from monsters with his hammer. After collecting treasures, he can bring them back to the nearest settlement to decode ancient relics and sell valuable items, using the proceeds to find more supplies to keep him going.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Thousand Land</em> is a real-time strategy game. Taking place on abstract worlds called \"geo-slates\", two opponents face off using small acorn-shaped units called APOs that spawn from a tree-like object called core. The units are controlled indirectly, and the goal in each battle is to destroy the enemy's core.</p>\n<p>Each match consists of two phases, a building phase and a battle phase. In the building phase, the player can remodel their geo-slate by raising and lowering the land (similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/613/populous/\">Populous</a>) as well as task the APOs with building objects like barriers, defensive weapons, traps and more. Construction energy and time are limited.</p>\n<p>In the battle phase, the APOs can be set to act either offensively or defensively, be picked up and dropped somewhere else or be lured to a certain point with a light, but otherwise act entirely on their own. Besides the APOs, there are also giant creatures called TELAs which can be summoned and act as powerful offensive units.</p>\n<p>The player's geo-slate is carried over from battle to battle. Winning gives the player currency which can be used to purchase new parts to place on the geo-slate in the building phase as well as new and more powerful TELAs to summon in battle. It is also possible to bet on the outcome of a match for additional money. The game includes one thousand opponents to battle against, organized in tiers named after chess pieces (from pawn to king) with the ultimate goal of reaching the king tier and defeating the highest-ranked opponent. The game also allowed online battles via Xbox Live.</p>",
