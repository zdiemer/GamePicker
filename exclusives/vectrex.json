        "description": "<p><em>Clean Sweep</em> is an arcade action game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a>. Robbers have just blown up your bank scattering the money around the now maze-like passages. You control a vacuum cleaner trying to recollect all of the money! Wandering about the maze trying to catch you are the bank robbers. If they do manage to catch you, you will lose one of your lives. Each corner of the screen contains a room where your vacuum can become super-charged. While super-charged, you can destroy the bank robbers. You can only become super-charged four times, so use this sparingly. As you collect the money, your vacuum slowly becomes full. When your vacuum no longer has room to collect money, you will need to return to the vault in the center of the room to deposit the money before continuing on. When you have collected all of the money, you will move on to the next level. A second game variation is available where the maze walls are invisible making it more difficult to navigate.</p>",

She is being held in a cage at the top of the screen; you need to find the key to the cage, and climb your way to the top. The screen consists of a moving catwalk which has several floors and gaps in it you need to jump over. There is also a ladder which can be moved around allowing you to climb between the different floors of the catwalk. As the levels progress, several enemies also appear which will be attempting to stop spike from reaching the top of the screen. To help out, Molly will occasionally drop a bow tie; if you collect this, all of the enemies on screen will temporarily freeze. When you have collected the key and reach the cage at the top, the level is complete and you move on to the next round.</p>",

You are the commander of a submarine on a rescue mission beneath the ice of the north pole. On each level your goal is to locate and rescue the survivors of an expedition. The waters you need to explore are quite dangerous; in addition to large chunks of ice and maelstroms, you will also need to deal with enemy submarines and numerous underwater mines. Your sub is equipped with a limited number of torpedoes to help you destroy obstacles and enemies in your way. Of course, to make the game more challenging your sub has a limited amount of oxygen. More oxygen can be collected by destroying enemy subs, but if you run out you lose one of your subs. The game ends when all of your subs have been destroyed.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Cosmic Chasm</em>, the player's mission is to penetrate an alien planet underground maze and destroy the planet's power structure in the central cavern. It can be played by one or two players taking turns.</p>\n<p>The maze consists of several caverns connected by tunnels. The player is shown an overview map before entering each cavern. They have to choose the shortest route towards the centre. Each cavern contains several drones that should be destroyed. Exits to caverns deeper in the system are blocked and must be opened with a drill first. In the middle of each cavern is a trap that slowly expands, the player must avoid touching it at all costs. The further the player penetrates into the system, the faster the drones are moving. After placing the bomb in the centre cavern, the player has 15 seconds to escape the maze, preferably using the way they came in.</p>\n<p>The game uses three buttons: one for thrust, one for a shield to defend against the drones and one for firing. Points are awarded for destroying the central structure, successfully escaping and drilling through walls.</p>",

The goal is to avoid touching further hexagons approaching the central hexagon from the borders of the screen for as long as possible. At least one of the sides of those approaching hexagons will be left open, so there is always room to escape. For distraction the whole game screen will constantly rotate around the center, occasionally changing the direction of rotation. Over time - to increase the difficulty - the shapes will start pulsating to the rhythm of the music, and the rotation speed will increase significantly when the soundtrack picks up a new theme.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the original <em>Hexagon</em> this vector based version is more simplistic: It does not feature any solid or advanced forms, only hexagons. Like the original this version contains only one song which is changing over time to match the gameplay. The game features two difficulty settings (Easy, Hard).</p>",

The vehicle is constantly moving right and the player can speed up or slow down, jump, and shoot (simultaneously firing upwards and forwards). The game contains 25 checkpoints labeled from A - Z, also serving as a respawn point. Every five checkpoints mark a separate \"stage\" within the entire course; reaching the end of a stage under the par time grants a large score bonus.</p>\n<p>Dangers on the Moon include rocks (small and big ones) which can be shot to pieces or jumped over, pits which must be jumped, and UFO's which fire at the player or bombard the ground (creating pits). Later the player also comes upon stationary tanks which fire missiles (that can be destroyed with the player's own shots), landmines, and rocket cars which stalk the buggy from behind before rushing forward in an attempt to ram it down.</p>\n<p>After completing the first course (the \"Beginner Course\") the player can try his skill on the harder \"Champion Course\".</p>\n<p>In contrast to the original game <em>Vector Patrol</em> added a few bonus features like 3D animations after finishing a stage below par or unlockable achievements such as extra backgrounds, additional buggies or new course.</p>",

From a ship shown through a side view the diver goes down by selecting a diving location. Big sharks, squids and giant eels need to be avoided, while sometimes a key can be located at the bottom to open up a treasure chest. Fish can be collected as well. The diving is done through single screens linked together vertically. Each diving location has a different depth (amount of screens to reach the bottom) and this determines the difficulty level. The diver also needs to keep track of the air supply. Additional air can be grabbed my moving over small bubbles floating upwards.</p>\n<p>Next to the main game there is a bonus game, calibration options and an overview of the collected treasure and discovered fish species. In the bonus game you control a fish in a fixed screen while different types of fish and creatures pass by from the right to the left and need to be avoided. There is only one life and the fish needs to survive as long as possible, while \"bombing\" squids to score points.</p>",

He is surrounded by outlaws that move around him clockwise. They sometimes shoot and move inwards. The sheriff can fire in the direction he is facing and needs to take out the bandidos. However he also needs to protect an innocent townperson who follows his around and needs to stay alive.</p>\n<p>There are twelve stages in total, each with a different character to save and an increasing difficulty level for instance introducing exploding TNT. Sticks of dynamite can be picked up quickly before they explode to disable them. After shooting a bandido a bird appears near the top of the screen. After completing a level a bonus can be played as a quick-draw shoot-out shown from a behind view with only a single bullet. Quick reflexes are needed to shoot first.</p>",

Not all of the items are good though, some of them may also downgrade your equipment.</p>\n<p>Every 5 levels an item shop will appear where it's possible to buy most of the upgrades also available from enemies, but also some special (and expensive) ones like Autofire, more power or one free hit.</p>\n<p>Configuration, high scores and unlocked achievements are saved to the cartridge.

Your mission is to defeat successive waves of alien craft and protect several grounded astronauts from being abducted in the process.\nYou have a laser gun to shoot at enemies and a hyperspace jump which instantly relocates your craft to a random location, as a means of last-resort defense.</p>\n<p>On the top part of the screen, you are provided with a minimap where you see the surrounding terrain and enemy positions therein.\n<em>Protector LE</em> has no ending, gameplay keeps on until all the player's lives are spent. \nBeing a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/platform:vectrex/sort:moby_score/page:1/\">Vectrex</a> game, visually it is 100% vector based and monochrome, with smooth scrolling and animations. \nIt was released in a limited run as a cartridge and included in the package was a tinted overlay for the CRT.</p>",
