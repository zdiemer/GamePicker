It is also different from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/77807/galaxion/\">Oric game</a> with the same title also published by Loriciels. Instead, the game features three different stages with different enemy formations. After the third stage, it is back to the first one again but at a higher difficulty. The first stage is most similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a> and features four rows of invaders that move back and forth while dropping projectiles at the player. The second and third stages are different and have aliens swirling around the screen based on two different movement patterns. The player has three lives and when they are all gone the game ends.</p>",

The game plays largely the same as the original albeit here only the top side of each cube is rendered. The player controls a young girl who has to jump from platform to platform so that all of them change colour. In the first level, each platform has to be jumped on once, while in the second two moves over each is needed. In the third one, only one move is required but making a second move will transform it back to its original state. At the same time, the player has to avoid three different enemies since any contact with them will lead to a lost life. There is a ball and a snake jumping between the platforms as well as a bird that flies across the screen.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Pillage Cosmique</em> is a variant of the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/63912/cosmic-guerilla/\">Cosmic Guerilla</a>. It is a fixed screen shoot 'em up where the player has to stop the alien invaders that attempt to steal the fuel canisters and space ships located in the centre of the screen. The aliens start from the sides of the screen and move towards the centre where they pick up the objects and return back to where they came from. The player's task is to shoot them down before they are able to escape. If an alien is shot while carrying an object it will return to its original position. If one of the space ships are stolen, the player will lose a life. A life is also lost when hit by the projectiles dropped by the aliens. In addition to the regular aliens, there are also saucers and space monsters to watch out for.</p>",
