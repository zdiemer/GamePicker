The goal is to earn as many points as possible by hitting the target with as few misses as possible. You can play with no time limit at an average speed, or increase the challenge by adding a time limit and increasing the game speed. This game can also be played by two players to see who can score the most hits.</li>\n<li><strong>Doodle</strong>: This is a computerized drawing program. Using the controller you can draw any picture you like on the screen. There are five different line sizes you can draw with and three available colors.</li>\n<li><strong>Quadra-Doodle</strong>: In this drawing program the computer will draw random patterns for you.

The goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting your opponent. On the game screen there are two barriers (located in the upper left and bottom right corners) and five mines (located in the middle of the screen). The tanks can not shoot through the barriers or mines making them ideal for cover. The tanks can drive through the barriers, but attempting to drive through a mine will cause your tank to explode awarding your opponent a point.</li>\n<li><strong>Shooting Gallery</strong>: In this game you control a rifle on the left side of the screen and need to hit a target on the right side of the screen.

        "description": "<p><em>Videocart-3</em> features a computerized version of the card game blackjack. The game follows the typical blackjack rules; your goal is to get cards totaling as close to 21 as possible without going over. The computer acts as the dealer, and is required to hit on a 16 or 'soft 17' and to stay on a 'hard 17'. The game features a full 52 card deck, and the computer will automatically shuffle the deck if there are less than 16 cards left; optionally you can request the computer reshuffle the deck at any time. One or two players can play, each player beginning the game with $500. There is a minimum bet of $1 and a maximum bet of $99. In the two player game a player who has gone broke may optionally borrow $100 from the house to re-enter the game.</p>",

The goal is to try to shoot down your opponent to score a point, and the player with the most points wins. Viewed from the side, your bi-planes have the freedom to fly anywhere on the screen; the screen wraps, so if you fly off of one side you will appear again on the other side. You can also hide just off screen to attempt to sneak up on an opponent; be careful, even though you may not be visible you are still vulnerable to attacks! The game can be played by two players against each other, or one player against the computer. When playing against the computer, the computer's skill level will vary throughout the game; the more times you are successful in shooting down the computer, the more its skill level will increase! However the more the computer shoots you down, the more its skill level will decrease.</p>",

The goal is to destroy your opponent's ship by depleting its energy supply; success will earn you a point. Each ship is capable of flying anywhere on the screen and is also equipped with lasers for attacking your opponent. At the beginning of the game each spaceship has 90 energy units; when no energy is left that ship will be destroyed. Energy can be depleted in two ways: 2 points are used up every time you fire your lasers, and 5 points are lost if hit by enemy laser fire. Should your energy level drop to 10 points or less, you will be unable to fire your lasers; this prevents you from accidentally obliterating your own spaceship! Energy units can be replenished by flying through one of the two starbases located at opposite ends of the screen.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Math Quiz I</em> is a math game which focuses on addition and subtraction. The game presents a series of problems to solve; using the controller you need to enter the correct answer, earning you a point. If you enter an incorrect answer you are then given a second chance. Answer incorrectly a second time and then a point is given to the computer which will also show you how to solve the problem. These are the only variations featured within the game itself, however the instruction manual includes a variety of suggestions for games that can be played by two or more players. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mathematical Chairs: Two players take turns seeing who can answer the most problems in a row;</li>\n<li>Math Maze: The manual features a maze drawn on a grid. Answer a question correctly and you can move that many spaces. The first person through the maze wins;</li>\n<li>Hang Math: A variation of hang man. For each incorrect answer you draw a part of the body. Too many wrong answers and your character is hung;</li>\n<li>Up to 1000: Answer problems correctly to add the value to your score. Try to end up with 1000 points without going over.</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p><em>Videocart-8</em> contains two traditional number games: <em>Mind Reader</em> and <em>Nim</em>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Mind Reader</em> is a numerical version of the popular combination guessing game most commonly known as <em>Master Mind</em>. The console chooses a random number with 2 to 5 digits, according to player selection. The player is given 20 chances to guess the number the console has chosen. After every guess, the display shows how many numbers were correctly placed, and how many numbers are correct but in the wrong spot. Every wrong guess increases the computer's score by one, and finding the code increases the player's score by the number of remaining guesses. The goal is to reach 100 points before the computer does. An alternative game mode gives the player a time limit instead of a limited number of trials.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Nim</em> is a single-player adaptation of a traditional 2-player number game. According to the game options, there are 3, 6, or 9 piles on screen, each with 1 to 15 elements, as designated by the numbers on screen. The player and the console now take turns at removing arbitrary numbers of elements from the piles. They have to remove at least 1 element, and they can only remove elements from one pile in any turn. The side that gets to remove the last element from the playing field, wins the round. Winning a round is rewarded with a predefined number of points, and the goal is to be the first to reach 100 points. The game can also be played with a time limit, which increases the points awarded per round.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p>In this <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a> variant, the player controls a gun turret at the bottom of the screen and fires missiles at incoming alien ships. The turret can move both left and right and hide behind three protective barriers. The alien invaders move left and right, fire missiles at the player, and slowly approach the planet surface - if they land, the player loses the game. Every once in a while, an alien mothership will fly across the top of the screen and shooting it will give the player extra points. The goal of the game is to destroy all alien ships in each attacking wave and score as many points as possible. The game ends when players lose their three lives.</p>\n<p>The game can be played by one or two players (turn-based or simultaneously). Depending on the selected game mode, there can only be 1 or 2 player missiles on the screen, and 2 or 4 alien missiles at the same time.</p>\n<p>There are 10 game modes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mode 1:</strong> 1 player, 1 player missile, 2 alien missiles</li>\n<li><strong>Mode 2:</strong> 1 player, 1 player missile, 4 alien missiles</li>\n<li><strong>Mode 3:</strong> 1 player, 2 player missiles, 2 alien missiles</li>\n<li><strong>Mode 4:</strong> 1 player, 2 player missiles, 4 alien missiles</li>\n<li><strong>Mode 5:</strong> 2 players, 1 player missile, 2 alien missiles</li>\n<li><strong>Mode 6:</strong> 2 players, 1 player missile, 4 alien missiles</li>\n<li><strong>Mode 7:</strong> 2 players, 2 player missiles, 2 alien missiles</li>\n<li><strong>Mode 8:</strong> 2 players, 2 player missiles, 4 alien missiles</li>\n<li><strong>Mode 9:</strong> 2 players, 1 player missile, 2 alien missiles</li>\n<li><strong>Mode 10:</strong> 2 players, 1 player missile, 4 alien missiles</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Game modes 5 through 8 have the players taking turns, while 9 and 10 have both players shooting at the aliens simultaneously.</p>",

The player's bowling ball starts out moving left and right across the front of the lane. This has the player trying to get the lane position they want the ball to start traveling down. Once the ball starts rolling down the lane, the player can curve the ball left or right. Once the curve has started, it can't be changed further.</p>\n<p>The game has 18 variations. They involve choosing the combination of number of players (1 or 2), then speed of play (slow, normal, fast, and fastest), and selecting a regular or split game. Regular games start with all pins standing in each frame while the split games have a random number of pins missing and the player has 2 balls to knock down the remaining ones.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This cart contains two different games.</p>\n<p>The first game is <em>Robot War</em>. It takes place on a space station. The computer malfunctioned and now four robots are out to hunt down the player. Gameplay mainly has the player trying to trick the pursuing robots into one of the four electrified force fields littered throughout the playfield. Every time the player is touched by a robot, one of the force fields disappears. Once all the force fields disappear, the player loses a point to the robots. If all the robots are defeated, the player gets a point for that round. The game also features an option for two players, where the second player takes control of the robots. The game features four game speeds from slowest to fastest.</p>\n<p>The other game is <em>Torpedo Alley</em>. Players control a shore battery at the bottom of the screen and shoot at an invading fleet of ships above them. Each hit ship is worth a different amount of points, with the lowest ship being worth 1 point, the middle ship worth 3 points, and the highest ship worth 5 points. The game ends when a player reaches 99 points or the adjustable time limit expires.</p>",

If the cards match, they disappear from the playfield. If they don't match, the cards are flipped back over face down and the player tries again. The better the player is at memorizing where the overturned cards were, the easier it will be to find a match.</p>\n<p>The game contains 4 variations of its basic premise. The Memory Match 1 variations offer a smaller grid thus making it easier.</p>\n<p>Memory Match 1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cipher-24 (6x4 grid with numbers)</li>\n<li>Symbol-24 (6x4 grid with symbols)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Memory Match 2:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Super Cipher-40 (10x4 grid with numbers)</li>\n<li>Super symbol-40 (10x4 grid with symbols)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The game offers both 1 and 2-player modes. When playing alone, the player tries to clear the board in the fewest amount of guesses. In the multiplayer, both players try to get more matches than their opponent.</p>",

The player is trapped inside a playfield and has to dodge a ball that continuously keeps bouncing of the sides of the playfield. The longer the player is able to dodge the ball, the more points are earned. After a certain amount of points are earned, another ball enters the playfield thus making the player have to dodge two balls. More balls keep getting added at fixed intervals after that until a total of 9 balls are in the playfield. The game ends when the player is finally hit by the ball.</p>\n<p>In the 2 player game, both players are put into the same playfield and try to outlast the other player in trying not to get hit by the balls being thrown by the computer.</p>\n<p>The game features random variations in the gameplay, such as having different sized playfields, ball sizes and speeds, and changing the players' size and speed. There's an Amateur and a Pro mode, both playable with either 1 or 2 players.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Although the title of the game may lead players to believe it's a pinball game, this is actually a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Breakout\">Breakout</a> variant. The basic gameplay features the player bouncing a ball off of a paddle into a wall of bricks, chipping them off one brick at a time. Each brick destroyed earns the player points with the low green bricks being worth 1 point each, the middle blue bricks being worth 4 points each, and the red bricks on top rewarding 7 points each. Once the ball bounces off the wall of bricks, it's up to the player to maneuver the paddle under the falling ball in order to hit it back up into the wall of bricks. The player loses a life if the ball is not hit with the paddle and it falls into the abyss. The game ends when 7 balls are lost. To keep up with the pinball motif, the wall of bricks are referred to as different colored skill lanes, the walls on the side that the ball can bounce off of are labeled side rails, and the paddle is referred to as a flipper.</p>\n<p>The game offers 132 game variations of this basic gameplay idea, some of them for two simultaneous players. Game modes include Pinball Wiz, Crossover, Blok-Shot, Cooperation, Pro Challenge, and Double Blok, with each having variations that can include different-sized paddles, ball speeds, invisible bricks, and even a variation where the paddle shrinks each time it hits the ball.</p>",

The player controls the 12 checkers at the bottom of the screen and attempts to remove the 12 checkers at the top of the screen, controlled by the computer. A player can only move checkers diagonally toward the opponent's side of the board. A checker can be jumped when two opposing checkers are adjacent to each other and there is an empty space directly across the checker being jumped. A player is forced to jump a checker that can be jumped. If a checker reaches the other side of the board, that checker is kinged and is allowed to move and jump both back and forth in diagonal movements. The game is won by the player who removes all of his or her opponent's checkers from the board.</p>",

To protect their goal, the player's paddle can fire missiles which can be aimed straight or angled up or downward. Missiles that hit whizballs can help propel them to start going in an opposite direction. If one of the missiles or whizballs hits the player's or the opponent's paddle, it will temporarily disappear leaving the respective goal undefended. The game is won when either one of the players gets to a previously selected score.</p>\n<p>The game contains 72 game variations of this basic premise. Variations include having from 1 to 4 whizballs, and 6 different game types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Basic</strong>: each whizball is worth only 1 point;</li>\n<li><strong>Basic Plus</strong>: players can guide the missile shots into the whizballs;</li>\n<li><strong>Bonus</strong>: whizballs can be numbered 1 through 4 and are worth that many points each;</li>\n<li><strong>Bonus Plus</strong>: adds guided missiles to the Bonus game type;</li>\n<li><strong>Super Bonus</strong>: whizballs increase in value from 1 to 9 points the longer they stay in play;</li>\n<li><strong>Super Bonus Plus</strong>: adds guided missile shots to the Super Bonus game type.</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p>This game cart contains two space-themed games:</p>\n<p>In <em>Galactic Space Wars</em>, the player controls a fighter spacecraft with the sole objective to find and destroy enemy spaceships. The players take a first-person perspective from inside the cockpit searching the vast area of space to locate enemy craft. Once one is located, players try to quickly fix their laser's sight on the enemy and shoot it. If the enemy stays on the screen for too long, it will fire one shot at the player's ship and score a hit. There are four different enemy ships, each worth a varying amount of points. Players are given a limited amount of time to destroy as many ships as possible, while trying not to let the enemy ships fire back.</p>\n<p><em>Lunar Lander</em> is inspired by the same titled arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Lunar+Lander\">Lunar Lander</a>. Players pilot a lunar lander and attempt to make a soft landing on a platform. The lunar lander has a limited amount of fuel to maneuver around, thus adding to the challenge. Players must gently and smoothly lower the lander onto the platform, as coming down too fast or missing the platform crashes the lunar lander. There is also a timer keeping count of the amount of time it takes for the player to land. The objective is to land the craft in the least amount of time possible.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Fairchild's Channel F console comes with two built-in games. Those two games are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hockey</strong> is an extended version of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pong\">Pong</a> concept. Two players try to get the ball to land in their opponent's goal. The paddles can be moved not only up and down, but all across the playfield. They can even be tilted to have the ball reflect in another direction. In addition to the main paddles, both players also have a special goal keeper paddle that they can move up and down between the poles. There are four ball speeds to choose from. Matches end when either one of the players reaches a score of 15, or after a time limit of 2, 5, 10, or 20 minutes. If the game ends in a tie, the players can decide to play 1 minute of overtime.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tennis</strong> is a simple <em>Pong</em> variant. Two players compete by passing back and forth a ball with paddles. If a player misses the ball, his opponent gets a point. In <em>Tennis</em>, the players can choose from 4 different game speeds. A round can be configured to end as soon as one player reaches a score of 15, or after a time limit of 2, 5, 10, or 20 minutes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

The player can choose either the white (actually green on screen) or black (actually red) pieces, and can select from 4 different AI difficulties. The easiest AI plays its turns in a matter of seconds but, as the difficulty increases, each turn can take several minutes. In the highest difficulty, the AI can take up to 50(!) minutes to decide its move. To allow the player to watch something else on the TV while the system is busy, the game cart has a very special feature: an integrated red led lights up while the machine is \"thinking\".</p>\n<p>During the game, the player can ask the computer to help him with his next move. In those situations, the system analyses the board and plays impartially.</p>",

        "description": "<p>An unauthorized version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/138/pac-man/\">Pac-Man</a>. </p>\n<p><em>Pac-Man</em> is a game where the eponymous Pac-Man goes around a maze in the cardinal directions munching pellets as he goes. The goal is to eat all the pellets found on the maze. While trying to do this, Pac-Man is harassed by four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde) who constantly chase him around the maze. If the ghosts touch Pac-Man, he will lose a life. Pac-Man starts with three lives and if he loses all of them the game will end. </p>\n<p>Pac-Man is not completely defenseless as on each maze, there are four power pellets, that when Pac-Man consumes them, will cause the tides to turn, as Pac-Man will be able to temporarily chase the ghosts to eat them and temporarily send them back to the middle of the maze from whence they came. Pac-Man can also eat randomly appearing fruit to earn bonus points.</p>\n<p>This version of <em>Pac-Man</em> retains the intermissions found in the original game.</p>",
