        "description": "<p>Solitairithmetic mixes solitaire with arithmetic. The game contains three separate versions of solitaire: card game, tile game, and peg game. The card game is similar to Klondike Solitaire, but instead of using traditional suits it uses Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction suits; scores are calculated by the cards on top. The tile game is like Mahjong; the scores are computed by the value and math symbols on the tiles. In the peg game, players jump pegs over other pegs until one peg is left; discarded pegs determine the score. In each game, mathematical symbols, such as multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction, and the number determine scores.</p>",

The protagonist of the game has been chosen as part of the special ops team selected to drop into the zone and deal with the threat. Unfortunately, the player got separated from his group, and now must accomplish his mission on his own.</p>\n<p><em>Pathways into Darkness</em> is a first-person shooter that places the player in the shoes of a special forces operative who has to advance through several dungeons filled with horrifying creatures (some lifted from Lovecraftian lore) in order to save the world. The game includes dialogues with non-playable characters, inventory management, and other assorted means of interacting with the game world (such as examining, using, etc.). The overall design puts an emphasis on puzzle-solving over firefights, as the player character is usually underpowered when fighting against his foes.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Flight Simulator for the Apple Macintosh became the third port of FS to a Motorola 68000 platform, following the Amiga and Atari ST. However, Microsoft, rather than subLOGIC, published the Mac version. While the first Mac release was dubbed \"Version 1.0\", it was in fact released four years after Version 1.0 for the PC, and thus was much different in nature. The graphics engine was much closer to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/14094/flight-simulator-ii/\">Flight Simulator II</a> for the Amiga and Atari ST. Naturally, the Mac edition was monochrome only, but at a higher resolution. The mouse was used for the throttle, yoke, and brakes, while the keyboard controlled the rest. Like FS II and MSFS 3.0, FS1 for the Mac featured pull-down menus and multiple view windows for the cockpit, spot plane, map, and control tower.</p>\n<p>MSFS for Mac could run on any classic Mac down to the 128k, although at that level, the \"war game\", sound, and situation library were disabled. With 512k RAM, in-game help was available for each instrument and menu function.</p>",

Pac the Man X was translated in Dutch and French.</p>\n<p>The gameplay of Pac the Man X is identical to Pac-Man however some bonus fruits have become power-ups like invincibility and speed up. The game has a unique difficulty level called \"Master\". It plunges all the game levels in total darkness. However, the player is able to see a few paces around him. The difficulty level \"Master\" only works in single player mode. Online ranking was added to Pac the Man X in April 2007, more than one year after its release. Players from all over the world can submit their scores. They are posted on the Web site of the developer.</p>",

Choose from eight characters, including Postal Paul, The Cowboy, The Astronaut and Super-Fan. Cash and prizes can be yours by escaping traps, completing missions and pummeling other contestants into submission.</p>\n<p>This game was developed by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/76317/brian-greenstone/\">Brian Greenstone</a> of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/2407/pangea-software-inc/\">Pangea Software</a> fame but released under the Bungie brand. Like most of Pangea's action games, it is a third person game set within a colourful environment. Since this game was developed during the early days of graphic card enhanced 3D, the fully 3D characters are a bit blocky. Each character has their own special attacks and can be played in a range of different \"arenas\". Each arena has its own specific task, often time constrained, and a host of baddies such as rats emerging from the floor, to delay and sap the strength of the contestants.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Bogus Guru</em> is a collection of four mini-games designed by the Foltz brothers. The games are laid out across a single level select screen and players must select which game they'd like to play before their cursor, a banana, is eaten by a floating guru.<em> </em>Rage of the Possum* is the first game in the collection and features a possum out to eat as many carrots as he possibly can. As it happens, he's also being chased by a green monster bent on stopping him. The player gains points for each carrot they eat and lose health each time they come in contact with the monster until, finally, they die, ending the game.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>The Hunted</em> follows a lone rabbit as he flees from a hostile, axe-wielding hunter. Morosely, the player simply attempts to survive as long as he can manage, scoring points for each second he remains alive. Eventually, he's caught by the hunter, ending the game.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Mannequin Wars</em> is a side-view fighting game in which mannequins of rivaling department stores rise up at night and battle it out in a local arena. The player is limited to either punching or kicking the opposing mannequin, with either attack being essentially the same in effect. There is no way to block, nor can either mannequin jump. As the battle progresses, limbs are lost, limiting the range of the player's attacks, until finally only a victor and a humbled torso remain. May the best mannequin win.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Non-Suicidal Edgar</em> is the fourth and final game in the collection and features Edgar who, while not suicidal, happens to have 23 pounds of explosives strapped to him. One of the surrounding bystanders is in possession of the key required to free Edgar from his impending, gory end, and it's up to him to shove everyone he sees until someone drops it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>None of the games feature high score boards, nor is there any way in which to save progress.</p>",

It was announced at the computer's launch and was featured in the original brochure, but its release was delayed until a couple of months later. It's an action game set on a chessboard and featuring Alice from Lewis Carroll's famous novels.  The board is viewed with a depth-perspective so that pieces and squares appear smaller the further away they are.</p>\n<p>At first, 6 chess pieces are lined up at front of the board and you choose which piece you want Alice to take on the moves of.  Once the game starts, Alice (seen from a behind-view) must capture all pieces on the board.  All pieces will hop around in arcing moves above the board and you as Alice must click on squares that are valid to move to according to the abilities of the piece you chose at start. If you are captured, your score decreases, and increases based on the value of pieces taken.  A perfect score of 999 is only possible if you allow all the pawns to become queens before capturing them.</p>\n<p>There is an options screen if you hold your mouse pointer over the score.  The Cheshire Cat appears on-screen and you can alter the game speed, flip the board upside-down or activate holes to appear randomly on chess board which capture any piece unlucky to be on that square.</p>\n<p>The game disk also contained some extras such as fonts and a maze generator game called Amazing.</p>",

There are many differences, though. You make your way level through level collecting loot and avoiding baddies, of course, but there is added complexity in movement.</p>\n<p>Your character must build bricks to jump onto or use as support, which can also be destroyed. With those bricks you navigate along both the x and y coordinate systems, making your way around the world. They are also used to block off enemies (assuming they can't destroy bricks themselves!) and uncover secrets by building over them.</p>\n<p>The enemies all bear likeness to toys but don't let your guard down; contact with them is always fatal. You have your common platform-fodder ones, but then there are balls which spin around all surfaces, robots that shoot lasers, and much more.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Escape Velocity</em> is an open-ended, role-playing arcade game set in a future where interstellar space travel has allowed mankind to expand its reach to countless unique solar-systems. The game is presented from a top-down, slightly isometric-view in which players control a pilot of one of the many space vessels the game has to offer. Traveling between the various different star-systems in the game is done through hyperspace travel, whereas sub-space travel is used for manual maneuvers, such as landing/docking and space combat.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the game, the player takes control of a single shuttle along with a few credits at their disposal and may proceed in whichever direction they would like. The main gameplay attraction comes from exploring and learning more about the universe in which <em>EV</em> takes place and, if the player so desires, engaging in space combat; either by siding with one of the different factions which are in conflict with each other or by simply staying neutral throughout the game and working for one's self.</p>\n<p>By landing on the different planets available in most systems, the player can find work through shipping or trading, upgrade or buy new ships, and obtain story-based missions.</p>\n<p>The main plot in EV revolves around a dispute between two rival groups, the \"Confederation\" and the \"Rebellion\". Depending on the player's actions throughout the game, the two factions may or may not be affected at all. It is completely up to the player as to whether or not to assist either of them.</p>",

One has to be careful, however, as the local police won't appreciate such senseless acts against the local populace. The option also exists to purloin various cars to facilitate movement from place to place, though they're oddly restricted to going either 0 or 50 miles per hour, not in between, often leading to a quick and painful end either for Tom or various hapless pedestrians.</p>\n<p>While both the game and its manual stress the player's choice as to which of the two courses of action to follow, it is largely illusory, as there is very little actual game to be found once the violence is stripped away.</p>",

As a bumblebee, defend your hive from invaders: beetles, stinkbugs, spiders, moths, centipedes, other bees--over a dozen in all. The novelty is in the control scheme: your bee continually flies forward, and you can rotate left and right and fire stingers *backward*. When attackers are splatted, the honeycomb beneath them fills with honey. Sometimes the honey is red, which causes special things to occur when you fly over it: invulnerability, the release of bonus daisies, a new hole for insects to emerge from is created, and so on.</p>\n<p><em>Bumbler Bee-Luxe</em> is an enhanced version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/35443/bumbler/\">Bumbler</a> (which was released the previous year).

There are four locations to choose from: the woods, the graveyard, the castle, and the dungeon. The game is entirely in black and white.</p>\n<p>The character has three lives and each location is based on the same concept. Travel from screen to screen, while fighting the location's basic monsters until you meet a boss character. Actions include punches, kicks and throws. Each level also has a flying enemy. When it is killed, it drops a talisman that destroy everything on the screen. There are also other weapons to use, such as knives, stakes, rocks, an axe, a gun with silver bullets and more. To unlock powers or weapons, enemies sometimes need to be defeated with a specific action. There is always a special weapon that can be used against the boss, and food restores health.</p>\n<p>Some of the enemies are werewolves, raven, ghouls, buzzards, spiders, skeletons, vampires and bats. To beat the scientist in the dungeon level, the previous bosses need to be defeated first. All three of them leave behind a special power (strength, accuracy, and agility), and the combination of them is needed to take on the final boss.</p>",

        "description": "<p>On an unnamed planet the primordial races of Snoot and Gram have warred with each other since time immemorial, each vainly struggling against the other. The balance of power may soon shift, however. An alien ship has recently crashed in the Rusty Scale Desert, in Snoot territory, bearing endless technological possibilities. The Gram are unsure of the ship's specific location, and haven't the resources to take both the entire desert and it's accompanying military installation quickly enough to make off with the ship. Enter Chum, the Gram's finest spy.</p>\n<p><em>Alien Conspiracy</em> is a side-scrolling, third person shooter in which players takes the role of an alien spy, Chum. The player's primary goal from level to level is to make it to the other end of the screen, which then advances on to the next. Due to the limitations of the game's engine, movement is handled using a grid-based system, and as such players are capable of seeing bullets travel through the air in a \"bullet time\" like effect. Although a spy, Chum will have to favor firepower over stealth in carrying out his assignment, as sneaking around an enemy is essentially impossible in the second dimension. Players can employ a number of different weapons in order to fight through the Snoot's implacable infantry and TacOps soldiers, however, from a simple pistol to a pump handle missile launcher.</p>\n<p>Playing as Chum the player must sneak into the military installation and steal the coordinates of the ship, thereafter crossing the desert and planting a plastic explosive in it's core. If the player succeeds the ensuing blast will wipe out every trace of the extraterrestrial technology and prevent the Snoot from gaining an advantage over the Gram.</p>\n<p>There is no save system, nor is there an in-game score. The game includes resources and instructions for players to add their own custom levels, though it lacks a centralized level editor.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Games That Didn't Make It</em> is a compilation of eight previously unreleased Epic Banana games. Several of the games are unfinished and a number of them stretch the definition of what one could reasonably term a game.* Flying Face - Less a game than an interactive experiment in\nPascal. A face flies across the screen, bouncing whenever it comes in contact either with the sides of the window or the user's mouse.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Kung-Fou - In essence a fairly small screen saver. A fellow is\nattacked by two men wearing ski-masks and proceeds to beat them within an inch of their life until you quit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Old Extreme Prejudice - A top-down shooter wherein the player takes the role of a special forces operative infiltrating a number of suspect\norganizations. Sometime in it's development it was superseded by an experiment in platforming, which ultimately became the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/43263/extreme-prejudice/\">Extreme Prejudice</a> that was eventually released. Due to it's unfinished nature the game is\nfairly short and has very few of it's features actually integrated\nwithin the game. There is a small, player versus player multiplayer component.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Plah - The player runs around in a small, sparse world alongside two\nbrown blob monsters. The player is capable of firing small red pellets but\nthey do absolutely nothing. They cannot otherwise interact with their\nenvironment and the game has no objectives.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stan the Swordsman - A simple side-scrolling medieval platformer. The player travels through two levels combating the forces of evil, such as spiders, with their trusty sword.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Terrorism - A text-based action game featuring three different\nscenarios based around combating the Dark Sun Clan, a terrorist\norganization. The game relies on randomization in order to make such an uncommon genre crossover functional. As it's unfinished it contains a number of not so subtle issues, one of the three scenarios even being incompletable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Vamp - The player is a vampire that walks around an incredibly small\ntown murdering men in their pajamas. The player has no hostile adversaries and they can neither win nor lose.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Xai - The player drives a car across a featureless plane dropping tacks. When the harmless scribble men wandering around the plane pass over the tacks they die and disappear. The game has no objectives or threats to the player. At the center of the level is a large character, for which the game is named, that has no bearing on the goings on around him and exists simply to scratch himself.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

As players progress through the Amazon the nature of the puzzles will sometimes reflect the area in which the player finds himself. While the game is presented in a platform format the game is non-violent, and has no dependency on reflexes or traditional side-scrolling gameplay. Adventure Joe may become trapped, which can render the game unwindable, however this is acknowledged as a bug.</p>\n<p>The game is divided into four parts, each encompassing three levels, which are represented by a specific time of day: morning, afternoon, evening, and night.

Unfortunately there are a number of dangers preventing your travel that you'll have to maneuver your auto around, such as reckless drivers on their way back, likely under the influence. As you avoid them it will be in your interests to collect 1-UPs to ensure your preservation, and point bonuses to add to your score. Two difficulty options are provided, each with mild differences in their gameplay.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Saving San Francisco - Random fleets of unidentified fighter pilots are descending on San Francisco for no clearly apparent reason and you're all that can stop them. Manning a defensive turret you'll have to shoot each of the targets out of the sky, as well as any bombs they might drop. For each target that you destroy much needed additional ammunition will be provided, while each that escapes will cost you. Shooting falling stars will provide an upgrade to your gun. If you fail, San Francisco falls.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sincretic - A one player variation on Pong, the difference being that an additional paddle has been added to the top and bottom, requiring that the ball be balanced onscreen regardless of where it might next bounce. There are three different gameplay modes, each offering a slight variation on aspects such as the speed of the ball.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Destroying San Francisco - The \"sequel\" to Saving San Francisco, this time tasking you as an invader in place of a savior. As with the previous game ammunition is a valuable commodity, restored with each hit on the enemy, and lost with each hit on an ally plane. Upgrades to the player's bombs are gained as more of San Francisco's tanks are destroyed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

As in its predecessor players take the role of an actor, Tom, in a small commercial, acting out a pre-defined script provided in the Read Me through a series of cues, actions, and dialogue options. A strong emphasis is placed on free will, and so the player has the choice either to obediently produce the intended commercial or embellish and even wreck it as they see fit.</p>\n<p>The gameplay in <em>Yogurt Commercial II</em> is similar to its predecessor but has been expanded on significantly. As in the previous game dialogue plays a central role of interaction, however dialogue trees have been done away with in favor of an always available 'menu' system; allowing the player to speak even where not required by the script. A prop box has also been added in the corner which can be rifled through at will in order to embellish aspects of the production, either by altering Tom's appearance or by providing new ways in which to interact with one's surroundings. The director will comment directly on your performance, however, and while he may not mind the addition of a hat or harmless flower protest may be made if a death ray is employed in such an innocuous commercial.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Gardyloo Golf</em> is a brief, top-down golf game with a number of unique twists. Due to the limitations of the engine used to power the game a stylized pixel-based art-style is used which focuses more on conveying visual information than modeling any sense of reality.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is fairly archetypal of the sport, the overarching goal being to guide a ball around various obstacles and into a corresponding hole, repeating the action over the course of several variant levels. The player may hit the ball with an amount of force ranging from one to five, dictating the distance that it will travel. The game is, however, grid-based in nature. As such hitting the ball with some number of force will cause the ball to travel an equivalent number of spaces in the direction that it was hit. No score is kept, nor are there any opponents to compete with, thus the game is entirely non-competitive.</p>\n<p>A clear emphasis is placed throughout the game on exploring and interacting with the environment, even over the more overt objective of golfing, despite these interactions being somewhat limited in scope. A pepper salesman also exists in a majority of the levels, allowing the player to breathe fire by consuming his notably spicy wares. While a curiosity that allows superficial aspects of the field to be altered the ability has no effect on the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>A number of hazards exist to impede progress, such as buildings and alligators, however as the number of additional golf balls is unlimited their effects are merely temporary; the game comes to an end purely by guiding the player from course to course, there existing no way to win or lose in a traditional sense.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Moshing Melvin</em> is a short game wherein the player takes the role of Melvin, a psycho mosher. Melvin has decided to partake in a night of ill-advised moshing at a local bar. When he arrives he recognizes his favorite band, Silent Static, being played from the speakers and, unable to control himself, he is sucked into the deranged violence of the mosh pit. The game has no music, the idea being that the player may supply whatever music they might prefer.</p>\n<p><em>Moshing Melvin</em> takes place entirely within a small, enclosed mosh-pit, viewed from the side via cross-section, which is filled with a number of fellow moshers. As moshers pass Melvin they will lash out at him with one of their many limbs, depleting the player's vitality meter and subtracting points from their overall score. Melvin, in turn, can flail out against the other moshers by punching or kicking them, which causes him to gain points. Melvin, alternatively, can mosh non-violently, in the form of headbanging, which slowly accrues him points but leaves him vulnerable to other moshers. As moshers are knocked senseless to the ground by Melvin's onslaught they will be slowly replaced by new arrivals, similarly inspired by Silent Static's aural offensive. As such the game ends only after Melvin is knocked unconscious or after the player retreats through an exit positioned off to the side, thereafter being presented with their final score and the option to play again. The end result is identical, regardless of how the player chooses to end the game, having no effect on either the resulting screen or score.</p>\n<p>The game does not posses a high-score board, nor does it keep track of any of the scores the player has achieved. Instead, the Read Me encourages players to take a screenshot of the score screen using the Macintosh's built-in screen capture tool and email the resulting shot to the developer. \"Let's see how you stack up against the hordes of other moshers!\"</p>",

It is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Glider+4\">Glider 4</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Glider+3\">Glider 3</a>. <em>Glider PRO</em> includes new features including a Two-Player mode, where players compete for prizes, enhancements to the Room Editor including the ability to use custom sounds and artwork, as well as a whole host of new prizes, enemies and locations.</p>\n<p>To move through the houses the airplane is told which direction to move in by controls the player configures in the Preferences. The glider must not hit the floor or obstacles including furniture, or you will lose a life. To keep the glider up in the air, blowers are used. These can be turned on or off by switches. The glider can also be kept in the air by candles, but don't get too close!</p>\n<p>Prizes which the glider must fly into to collect mainly come in the form of clocks, these will raise your score, as do invisible prizes. Paper will give you another life, Helium will allow you to move the glider in an upward direction and Batteries will allow you to fly through rooms very quickly.</p>\n<p>The enemies you will encounter on your adventures include Flying Darts, Balloons, Hot Toast flying out of a Toaster, a fish which jumps out of its bowl, Power Points which have a slight Electrical Problem and Basketballs which simply bounce. Avoid all of these or you will lose a life. Some enemies can be turned off by switches.</p>\n<p>The houses included with the original version are:* Demo House: A simple house designed to teach the player how to play the game, it includes one star.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Slumberland: A huge house including just over 400 rooms and 6 stars. The action takes place in a wider variety of rooms, including graveyards and sky walkways.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Castle of The Air a.k.a Castle o' The Air: A castle in the sky, in which the player will fly though dungeons, courtyards and through passages overcome with cobwebs. The house contains 85 rooms and 4 Stars.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The CD-ROM version contains extra houses and tools for house creation, as well as demos for other games by Casady and Greene. The game has since been released as freeware and ported to Mac OS X, but minus the Room Editor and complete preferences.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Pedestrian Devastation</em> is a brief, side-scrolling game in which the player takes the role of Agent Paroxysm, an ersatz policeman hired to stop protests and other matters of social unrest.</p>\n<p>The game is partitioned into five separate missions, in addition to several hidden levels, which can be played in whatever order the player prefers. At the beginning of each mission the player arrives to find a disintegrating matter of public irregularity which he must rectify, either by means of rationale and an extensive vocabulary or an extreme use of non-lethal force. For the majority of missions there are multiple ways in which the player may succeed, though depending on the situation certain approaches to the problem will be more successful than others. For example, it is unlikely that one will be able to discuss the problems of a group of protesters with them if they don't happen to speak English, nor would a stern talking to likely be enough to calm a full-fledged riot.</p>\n<p>If the player chooses to be hostile toward the public disruptors they will have a near bottomless inventory of tools to assist them, such as a nightstick, a set of flash and gas grenades, a fire extinguisher, and a firearm which fires rubber bullets, among other items. The game also contains a number of very specific interactions to assist the player's efforts, as well, each mapped to a separate key, such as the ability to pick up a box, expectorate (Spit), or jostle someone. Some of these items and actions are limited depending on the mission, however, narrowing the player's options. Additionally the player may at any time recite a collection of various phrases, which has no effect on the game itself but pleases Agent Paroxysm.</p>\n<p>A save system does not exist in the game, although due to its short nature it is unlikely that this would ever be needed, nor does the game feature any music.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mystery Island II</em> is a first-person puzzle-based adventure game in which the player takes the role of Lt. Steven Bushell, a U.S. Navy Seal onboard the USS Volarus. While on patrol the Volarus is destroyed under unusual circumstances by an unidentified vessel, assumed to be a Russian warship. As the only survivor of the blast the player washes up on the shores of an uninhabited tropical island. As he explores his temporary home he uncovers that the island houses technology and structures unfamiliar to him, and subsequently uncovers a secret which may threaten the fate of mankind.</p>\n<p>The locations that the player explores within the game are presented as static, pre-rendered images to be surveyed and interacted with, giving a somewhat surreal impression of the game world. The player navigates the world by rotating the protagonist left or right and clicking specific sections of the screen to advance ahead to that area, rather than simply clicking forward to advance forward.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is largely based on exploration of the various locations within the game, to the point that many puzzles may be solved simply by gathering and making use of disparate information scattered within the game world. In keeping with this the player's mouse cursor is unchanging, giving no indication of whether an object is takable, capable of being interacted with, or simply observable. As such if an object is clicked on the default response is for it to be described, interaction only taking place in cases where it would be logical and objects being taken only where necessary. The inventory system has been equally optimized to support this play style. If the player happens to click on an object in their possession it will be described or commented on by Lt. Bushell via text string unless they happen to be in a location where the item can be used, in which case it will be used without requiring more specific prompting from the player. This emphasis on information over objects makes the oft used adventure game approach of 'brute forcing' the game by trial and error virtually impossible.</p>",

Your job is to take command of a squadron of planes seen on an overhead map and try to outmaneuver enemy pilots, sometimes you're also required to conduct air strikes. As the period covered in included scenarios is post-WW2 jet age, combat focuses on guided missiles, but planes may also engage using guns, while ground targets can be attacked as well with bombs. The turn-based gameplay may be tweaked to preferred difficulty level (stalls are more forgiving, target acquisition is easier etc.).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Another Day at Work: Wednesday</em> is an open ended sequel to Epic Banana's previously released <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/37012/a-day-at-work/\">A Day at Work</a>. Players once again take the role of Tom, an employee at Office Inc., and guide him through a typical day in his small, self-contained town. Whether Tom chooses to live the life of a law-abiding, office going citizen or an unruly, nihilistic member of society is entirely in the hands of the player. Due to the nature of the game there are no goals to accomplish, nor can the player win or lose, and thus the game does not end unless Tom is killed.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is largely grounded in exploration of the city, which is broken up into numerous individual fixed screens, and interactions with the environment and objects therein. Unlike the majority of open world titles, <em>Wednesday</em> strongly emphasizes the copiousness of interactions over any sizable physical scale. As such, while there are only sixteen buildings and three main streets in the game's city, there tends to be a high concentration of interactive objects and multiple solutions to scenarios and problems the player might come across. Because of this approach, many of the actions that the player takes in one area will effect the possibilities available in other sections of the city. For example, calling your work with a bomb threat will result in its temporary closure, limiting the player's possible sources of income.</p>\n<p>At the top of the screen is a status bar which provides an overview of Tom's present condition. This provides the player with information about how healthy he is, how much money he's carrying, how hungry he might be, the time of day, and the contents of his inventory. At any given time he can carry only one object and one weapon in his inventory, although the items he might have are almost always temporary or of a single use. If the player fails to keep Tom fed he'll begin randomly collapsing, which reduces his health. If his health runs out, Tom dies.</p>",

When one of the three actions can be used, a prompt lights up at the bottom of the screen, informing the player.

Based on the level of the reputation meter, certain areas of the game will become accessible to the player that were previously off limits.

All that the agent knows is that he must infiltrate the headquarters of the technology development and production firm Antrack, which is thought to be involved in much more suspect business.

        "description": "<p><em>Lose/Lose</em> is a game about choice and consequence veiled as a classic top-down shooter. Players control a spaceship with one life and an endless amount of bullets, engaging the enemy. Instead of random monsters, each enemy represents a file on the player's actual hard drive. Enemies are procedurally generated based on actual file extensions and when an enemy is shot, the extension is revealed. Destroying an enemy physically destroys the related file on the hard disk, removing it permanently.</p>\n<p>There is no option to determine which files can be used, so the damage ranges from a random text file to a crucial system file, selected randomly from the hard disk. The game starts with the player's home directory, going after the documents first and next the preference files. Before starting the game, players are warned explicitly that it is not a joke and that playing the game will permanently remove files on the user's computer. The only option to avoid that is either never to shoot or simply not to play the game.</p>\n<p>When the player is hit by an enemy the game is over and the game itself is deleted.</p>\n<p>The game's high scores are listed on the developer's project page.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the best tradition of pyramid exploration, you start this contemplative first-person adventure game trapped, with no way to go but deeper into the ancient Egyptian tomb.  As a journeyman archaeologist banned from the Kirdaza site, you're not even supposed to be there.  The dig is closed, oil company property, and no one will come looking for you.  Your crackpot notions of a three thousand-year history for the vast tomb, possibly hiding secrets to the origin of life, have made your colleagues eager to forget you, while the earthquake and aftershocks are guaranteeing they will.</p>\n<p>As you probe deeper, opening one new passage after another, carefully navigating the remarkable engineering of the tomb, you find you are following in the footsteps of another outcast archaeologist.  One hundred seventy years before you, when the tomb was first discovered by modern science, someone else trod this path into its heart, leaving notes along the way.  They provide clues and warnings, but the most valuable map comes from your own notes on the mythical passage of the sun god, Re, into the underworld.  The secrets of the tomb run deep into the earth, and neither fire nor water -- nor even gravity -- behave as they should.</p>\n<p>Ambient, stereo sound and simple exploration mechanics give the game an immersive atmosphere.  There are no sudden turns or steps forward; all movement is smooth, executed by clicking and holding on the direction you wish to turn or move.  Motion stops when you release the mouse button.  In this way, you can slowly spin 360 degrees in the horizontal, while at the same letting your gaze wander from floor to ceiling.  Similarly, you move objects by clicking and dragging.  You can carry a small inventory, and a map and compass take some of the guesswork out of finding your way around.  Nonetheless, the size of the tomb makes getting lost a part of game play.  The puzzles are closely focused on ancient Egyptian culture, and by the time you complete your journey through the tomb, you will be well-versed in the narrative of the Re's boat passage, which was central to ancient Egyptian funerary rites.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Magical Flying Pink Pony Game</em> is a first-person turret shooter set in a colorful, candyland world which the player attempts to deprive of its magical, pony populace. A macabre contrast, between the carefree environment and the bloody destruction that the player brings on it, is a running theme throughout the game.</p>\n<p>By means of a stationary turret the player attempts to blast as many flying ponies out of the sky as they possibly can, gaining a number of points for each successful kill. The game possesses depth of field, and so ponies nearer the turret will collide with a fired missile sooner than ponies farther out in the field, requiring that the player fire in expectation of where a pony will be, rather then where they are. If ten ponies manage to make it from one side of the screen to the other alive, the game ends in a \"Game Over\", and the player must start again.</p>\n<p>Particularly tricky shots, such as head or wing shots, provide the player with bonus points based on the difficulty of the shot. Each time the player manages several successive shots of any kind they are given a point multiplier; 2x for two in a row, 3x for three, etc. If the player misses, the multiplier is reset. As the player's score increases more difficult enemies appear, such as ponies which weave across the screen and green ponies, which take three shots to kill.</p>\n<p>Noteworthy achievements, such as killing particularly large numbers of ponies or making a number of difficult kills, are tracked using a system of visual rank indicators at the lower end of the screen. The awards are broken up into three categories: stars, wedges, and bars. Stars are contingent on the number of score bonuses the player achieves, wedges on the number of kills, and bars on the player's raw score. Once the player achieves three advances of any of the three ranks they receive some form of reward in the shape of a better weapon, a brief bonus round, etc.</p>\n<p>The game is available both as a stand-alone application and as a slightly less featured Dashboard widget, which has fewer display options. At the end of each play-through the player is given an opportunity to log their score on an online high score board and compare their achievements with those of other players.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Towers</em> is an implementation of the classic \"Tower of Hanoi\" puzzle for Macintosh systems. The objective is to move the rings from one end of the puzzle to the next by moving them between the pegs placed on the board. You cannot place a larger ring on top of a smaller ring, and the rings must be ordered from biggest to smallest, bottom to top, for you to win. The faster you complete this task, the more bonus points you will earn.</p>\n<p>The game lets you use from three to eight rings, and you can also let the computer play the puzzle alone.</p>\n<p>This game is not freeware or shareware, but <em>donationware</em>. The author encourages people to donate money to Cystic Fibrosis Research, Inc., in honor of his daughter, Rachel Z\u00f6e Silver. The game also contains a lengthy explanation of the disease, and how it affects people suffering from it.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A simulation so spare it can barely be called a game, this game puts the player in charge of a gas station, controlling three factors: whether to buy bulk gas today (at today's wholesale rate, which may fluctuate tomorrow), whether to purchase an additional gasoline storage tank, and what to set today's gasoline prices at.  The goal is to amass $30 thousand -- seemingly trivial, given that the player begins two thirds of the way there!  Ah, but then the price wars begin with the other station across the street and to remain competitive a player is driven to sell gas, temporarily, at a price below that which it was bought for.  Observing only the factors of the daily price of wholesale gas, the competitor's price yesterday, and both stations' gallons sold yesterday, the player need devise a gradual strategy to slowly but steadily turn black gold into conventional lucre.  Customers are canny, and will happily shut out a gas station entirely if its prices are too far out of line with its competition, but a price-slashing race to the bottom impoverishes both the player and the computer opponent.  Compounding things, when prices escalate at the pump, wholesale rates rise!  Real gas prices are informed by such complicated factors as geological exploration, seasonal storms, heavy industry and armed insurrection; however, often it can seem as logical as a monkey throwing a dart blindfolded.  This game simulates all that fun -- and more!</p>",

Once the eggs are cracked, baby chicks fall out of them, which he must then grab. The more baby chicks he catches in a row, the bigger the bonus points he'll get for them. But if he misses just one, the streak is broken and he has to start again. Once he collects twelve baby chicks, the \"Baby Chick Roulette\" on the side of the screen will start up. This roulette can earn you bonus points, special power-ups, or other bonuses!</p>\n<p>There are also special eggs in the playfield. Some eggs need more than one hit to be cracked open; a Rainbow Egg will give you the chance to use two Butasans at the same time; and a bomb will destroy any eggs that are around it when it blows up.</p>\n<p>But you have to watch out for Josephine; if you let her catch you, you won't be able to move for a few seconds, which may cause you to lose your Butasans!</p>\n<p>The game contains a total of thirty-two levels to beat. Once you've cleared them all, you'll get to meet <em>The King of Eggs...</em></p>",

        "description": "<p>Four real live human beings (a multimedia artist, a traffic flagger, a politician, and a onetime EA game tester) take the stage and deliver existential monologues about their real-life careers, then instruct the 200 people in the audience to remove the joysticks from the seat backs before them and direct their attention to the projection screen at the back of the stage.</p>\n<p>For over two hours the group plays a game midway between Ayn Rand's interactive play <em>The Night of January 16th</em> , Peter J. Favaro's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Alter+Ego\">Alter Ego</a>, and <em>American Idol</em> audience polls. Every audience member is assigned a blobby avatar on-screen at all times. Right from the get-go they are given questions to answer -- do we want our avatars to be male or female? gents on the left, ladies on the right -- then the same mass polling technique is applied to further questions defining not just personal avatars but the rules of the game world of BestLand: do \"we\" want to have abilities evenly distributed or to have a society where some members excel while others are disabled? Majority rules OK! Meanwhile, the floor tips as though the two halves of the screen are the two trays of a balance scale.</p>\n<p>Time passes, triggered by the on-stage game facilitator, accompanied by further monologues and more cutting questions: your avatars are 15 now! Who wants to celebrate by experimenting sexually? We'll just shunt the late bloomers off to the side for a moment and the male avatars for that matter... meanwhile, it is calculated that 50% of the adventurous female avatars didn't employ effective contraception, and are now pregnant. They get a further prompt: keep the baby or abort it? Not a choice many are expecting to have to make in a game, and not in front of an audience of two hundred.</p>\n<p>Other lifestyle choices made throughout the avatars' lives (about two hours) influence their careers (four to choose from, same as the speakers on stage) and, relatedly, their financial assets, as well as their appearance (parent avatars have mini blobbies orbiting around them; ex-cons grow devil horns; homeowners are graced with a roof appearing over their head. And so forth.) Some of them go abroad, are jailed (by the laws decided by their peers) or hospitalised and are temporarily taken out of play. Meanwhile the players grow familiar with the four buttons on the joystick in addition to navigation of the 2D plane; jump, drop (return to one's initial position on the screen), bond (find a romantic partner in the vicinity) and split (shed a romantic partner... and lose 1 Besto, the local unit of currency.)</p>\n<p>In adulthood the option presents itself for avatars to stand for public office; mounting the pedestal, their indicting record of choices (or worse, their failure to vote) is plainly presented for all to see -- a player's history on subjects of compassion, justice, patriotism, drug criminalization, immigration, gun ownership -- and terrifyingly the microcosm gets to vote arena-style, blobs mobbing the pedestal most appealing to the most players. The President gets to make a few choices on everyone's behalf (including the choice to suspend future elections -- tempered by a group poll on whether to mount a coup d'etat) but mostly they just meekly back down on unpopular matters of taxation and roll with the punches when an actor rolls a random disaster on giant novelty dice during sporadic news breaks delivered live on stage and appearing simultaneously on-screen through a videocast.</p>\n<p>The years tick on through dozens of personal decisions and eventually almost all the avatars on screen have IV bags following them around in their dotage. Following a last huzzah of a user-created snowstorm (if one flake falls every time an avatar jumps...) a pit opens in the centre of the screen, allowing world-weary avatars to hurl themselves into the abyss; survivors can hang on a bit longer but past age 100 the winds of change ultimately blow everyone off-screen.</p>\n<p>The speakers share their final pieces; the players put their joysticks back in the seatback pouches and leave the theatre.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Out of the Sun</em> is a sophisticated World War II flight simulator that puts players in the cockpit of authentic WW2 aircraft in the three most famous prominent battles of the war: The Battle of Midway (Pacific theatre), Operation Overlord (D-Day) and The Battle of Kursk from the European theatre.</p>\n<p>The player chooses which theater and which side to fly for (United States, Great Britain, Germany or Japan). This choice determines which planes can be selected for the specific battle. All of the planes have sub-missions in addition to the main scenario. Control the aircraft using the keyboard, joystick or mouse. Various weapons can be selected as well as settings for landing gear, hydraulics, brakes, and flaps.</p>\n<p>Skill Levels (from easiest to most difficult) are Arcade, Training, Combat and Veteran. The G-L.O.C. (Gravity-Induced, Loss of Consciousness) option lets players experience the effects of G-forces onscreen - Blackouts (from excess G forces) and Redouts (from too many negative Gs).</p>\n<p><em>Out of the Sun</em> is a single player game.

        "description": "<p><em>Gnop!</em> is a variant of <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/pong-variants\">Pong</a> that is most notable for being the first game developed by Bungie Software. The gameplay stays close to the original formula. The player controls a paddle on the right side of the screen and has to move it up and down to direct a ball past the AI controlled paddle at the other side of the screen. The rules of Gnop! differ somewhat from traditional Pong in that the score system is similar to Volleyball. The player therefore can only score when he is serving. The game allows the player to modify some parts of the game. Both the size of the paddles and the size and speed of the ball can be changed. It's also possible to change the ending score and which player serves first. There are three different difficulty levels.</p>",

Then, another wave of bricks with gaps in different locations.  And another.  This game has no ending, and is played for high score accumulation.</p>",

        "description": "<p>At launch, two days after <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/28791/ridley-scott/\">Ridley Scott</a>'s 1984 commercial, the Apple Macintosh hit the store with a bold plan to present itself as a business machine to rival anything <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=IBM\">IBM</a> had for the home consumer. To distance itself from the seemingly disposable home video game units tarred in the North American video game crash of 1983, the machine's marketing division avoided appearing concerned for its gaming potential, maintaining distance even between in-house efforts like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/33031/through-the-looking-glass/\">Through The Looking Glass</a>. Nonetheless, two games were included among the Macintosh operating system at launch:<em> First, there was the multitaskable </em>Puzzle<em> desk accessory, a sliding-tile game with its tiles numbered rather than patterned with images. (</em>Puzzle<em> remained with Macs until it was replaced with </em>Jigsaw* in 1994 with Mac OS 7.5, and a similar game is included in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Mac+OS+X\">OS X</a> Macs of today.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Second was <em>AMAZING</em>, bundled with the \"Guided Tour of Macintosh\" diskette (and audiocassette!) included with the computer (and, curiously, also with distributions of <em>Through The Looking Glass</em>). As its name suggests, it's a maze game where the player uses the mouse to trace a path connecting two points, a square and a circle, within a maze. Mazes of multiple difficulty levels are included.</li>\n</ul>",

This of course makes the great idol very angry and he releases the twelve idols of the Idol City who turn the island upside down and mutates its inhabitants into strange creatures. Only one of the islanders is lucky, Native Nick, who is out fishing when he finds a note in a bottle informing him what has happened. Nick is now the only one who can save the village. To do so he has to retrieve the Nose and return it to Mohawk. </p>\n<p>Mutant Beach is most similar to an adventure game although with some action elements. The player takes control of Native Nick and gets to move around the island with either keyboard or mouse controls. To get help in retrieving the nose, the player has to talk with the idols and ask what they want in return for their help. This can be either gifts or magic spells. Most of the game involves searching for and collecting these items. Sometimes a magic spell is needed to retrieve the items. The mutants are not all very friendly and might be dangerous or require magic to overcome. The player also has to watch out for the mutated islanders who tries to steal items from the player's inventory. When they attack the player can protect himself by bonking them and they will then be stunned for a short while. </p>\n<p>The game has a time limit. The player has to complete it in 30, 60 or 90 minutes depending on his choice. If he fails to do so Mohawk will turn him into a rock.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Escape the House</em> is a brief first-person adventure game in which the player is trapped inside of a house, having presumably been kidnapped, and must escape in order to find their way back home.</p>\n<p>The majority of the game involves exploring the house in order to find a set of keys that, together, will unlock the front door. These keys are hidden throughout the house and the player must pixel-hunt the many rooms in the house in order to find them. Besides keys, the only other items that players can carry with them are sandwiches, which similarly serve a puzzle solving purpose. In addition to searching for and using items, the only other type of obstacle to the player comes in the form of a riddle that prevents the player from progressing after they have escaped the house.</p>\n<p>Aesthetically, the game is played almost exclusively in black and white while the player is trapped in the house; the game only introduces color once the player has escaped. The game also contains a musical score, with each section of the game being accompanied by its own unique instrumental acoustic guitar piece played by the game's creator.</p>\n<p>The game features a save game function although it is impossible to die or render the game unwinnable.</p>",

The building is a maze that consists of a number of rooms. Each room is connected to other rooms through a number of doors. The goal of the game is to navigate to the building's center room (number 45) and then back to the starting room (number 1) in the smallest possible path (16 steps). The rooms all have different clues and the puzzle solving involve examining the graphics and from that determine what door to pick. Clues can refer to a specific door in a room or it might be related to other clues and together indicate a path. The game features a narrator that guides the player through the maze while telling its story. Once the player has made it through the maze in the shortest path, he can try to solve a final riddle in room 45. The answer to it can be found along the shortest path.</p>",

The game consists of a number of mazes that the player has to navigate his way through to get to a castle.

To pass through these the player has to solve math problems. There are also doors that are locked and for these the player first have to locate a key to open. Scattered through the mazes are also books which the player has to collect before he gets access to the castle. </p>\n<p>The game's problems are divided into 45 levels. As the player makes his way through the game he automatically progresses through the levels. It starts with simple counting problems and simple additions and subtractions but gets continuously harder with problems involving multiplication and division. Many of the problems are worded and involve more than just numbers. The player can at any time increase or decrease the level if he finds it too easy or hard. When a level is completed the player gets a certificate that can be printed. Some options exist when the player gets stuck. He can ask for a hint, to see the solution or to get a new problem.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The land of Tagor-Dal was for thousands of years ruled by the mighty High Kings. During these times the country was prosperous and its people happy. However a threat was always present, the nearby kingdom of Malokor that was ruled by the Black Sorcerers. Thereby a group of sorcerers were sent out on a mission to collect seven staves that was to be used to drive away all evil from the lands. This lead to peace but it was not to last as it lead to complacency and stagnation. At the same time the power of Malokor increased and as Tagor-Dal got weaker and weaker, evil struck the land. With the kings dead and the staves presumed broken, three hundred dark years followed. Now a strange messenger has appeared, summoning an army of heroes willing to face the evil legions. The player is one of these and has been summoned to a hidden sanctuary to be trained to be a warrior. Within the sanctuary also lies the last surviving stave which when found can be used to save the world. </p>\n<p><em>Legends of the Lost Realm</em> is a first person fantasy role playing game. The game starts in the barracks were the player has to create a party of up to six characters. There are four basic classes (fighter, thief, shaman and magician) each which has one to three specialization classes that can be chosen when levelling up. These include for instance samurai, monk, healer and witch. Once a party has been assembled the player can start exploring the corridors of the citadel. This is done through a point and click interface similar to other first person RPG's of its time. Combat consists of random encounters and enemies are not visible from the first person perspective. Instead combat takes place on a separate screen that consists of textual descriptions and simple icon based graphics. The combat is turn based and for each character the player picks one of five commands (attack, hide, cast, use or switch). A retreat option is also available and it's possible to bribe the enemies and thereby avoid a fight. Some enemies not only attacks but also try to steal the player's possessions.</p>",

They will need it to defeat the black sorcerers in the final battle at the gates of Malakor. To survive the player not only has to defeat the many foes but also be aware of thirst, hunger, heat and cold. Not all people are enemies, there are also friendly NPCs that give clues on how to succeed.</p>",

Instead of battles that put entire civilizations at stake an alternative way of solving conflicts has been conceived, the AmoebArena. Stranded negotiations doesn't end in bloodshed but are instead resolved on a microcosmic playing field where single cell organisms battle it out against each other.</p>\n<p><em>AmoebArena</em> is a turn based strategy game similar to a board game. It involves four players (either AI or human) who compete on a grid based board. Each player has a territory of 16 squares where they can place their organisms. Once the game has started each player gets to make three actions for each turn. There are four different organisms each with their own characteristics: cytozoids, amoeboids, mitoplsts and blockers. Cytozoids and amoeboids can reproduce. For each opponent killed their reproductive points are reduced and when it reaches zero the player can choose to either reproduce them of to increase their stats. The organisms attack in different ways. A cytozoid has to be moved to a square with an enemy while an amoeboid can only move to an unoccupied square. However it then gets a free attack action on any adjacent enemies. A mitoplast attacks by launching its genetic code and thereby converting the enemy into an ally that can be controlled by the player. A blocker cannot attack an enemy but it can intimidate it causing it to flee to another square. This can be used to push enemies into pits and thereby killing them. The winning criteria is simply to clear the board of all enemies.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Galactic Frontiers</em> is a turn-based strategy game set in space. The First Empire, composed of 25 planets, collapsed and the player's goal is to build a new one. Unfortunately, the leaders of the other planets are not cooperative and so violence has to be used.</p>\n<p>The economic system of the game is relatively simple: each planet produces a number of ships each turn which are either moved over the galaxy for warfare or sacrificed to develop planets. Each planet is rated in five values which may be improved over time. Each value gives certain advantages, e.g. tax is the monetary income or fortifications improve combat effectiveness. Other than that, the player may also construct either a star gate (fast travelling) or a star cannon (improves the speed of nearby ships) per planet. The galaxy is inhabited by three races with different abilities in built, attack and defense. Each round, random events like black holes or plague may occur which considerably change the cards.</p>\n<p>The game comes with five scenarios which change the underlying statistics, rules, probabilities and victory conditions. With the sixth custom scenario, the player also has the opportunity to customize all those things manually. The planets and their starting statistics are randomly divided in each game.</p>",

The game is a top down shooter where the player moves around a maze and has to prevent the enemies from getting away with the jewels that are located in the center of the maze. The enemies enters the maze from all directions and the player simply has to shoot them down before they are able to steal the jewels and escape. For each jewel that the enemies manage to get away with the planet will lose some of it's power. When all enemies have been killed the player advances a level and more, different and faster enemies appear.</p>\n<p>When the player's energy is full he can withstand five enemy hits and three collisions before dying. Energy increases proportionally depending on how many jewels are still left at the end of a level. Energy is drained throughout each level and whenever the player is hit. The game is over when all of the energy is gone. Scoring is based on enemies killed and jewels defended. A killed enemy is worth three points and a rescued jewel is worth one extra point. At the end of each level the player also gets one point for every remaining jewel. For every 200 points scored the player gets one extra jewel (as long as he has less than the starting eight).</p>",

The playing field is full of barriers that causes the worm to change direction and move down one line. When shot the worm splits in two parts, each moving continuously down the screen. Each section of the worm that is shot creates a new barrier. Barriers can be destroyed and sometimes they then drop pills consisting of power ups. These allows for a more powerful weapon. For example shooting three shots at once. There also pills allows the player to move through barriers and giving an extra life. Each pill is active under a limited amount of time. In addition to the worms there are some other enemies that moves around the playing field and the player has to avoid. Each level consists of six waves of worms that the player has to defeat. After a level is completed there is a bonus round where the player has to shoot down as many drones as he can. The player can't be killed in by these but earns bonus points for taking them all out.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This space trading simulation sequel uses extended features of the original game engine.  It has a new story in a different larger universe with over a hundred star systems connected by a series of hyperlanes. Hyper-jumps using these take 1-3 days depending on the ship's mass. Ships can land at planets, stations, and some other stellar objects. If it's an inhabited place, you can access the mission computer to customize your ship with weapons and outfits, purchase new ships, refuel, take jobs, or trade commodities.  At spaceport bars, you can gamble, hire escort ships, watch the news, and sometimes receive additional unique missions. </p>\n<p>Star systems are controlled by different governments which may be friendly, restrict some areas or are openly hostile.  You can change status towards them by taking missions from them, attacking their enemies, and destroying pirates.  If you help opposing governments, attack the government's or their allies' ships, or pirate civilians, your status will worsen with them.  The gameplay is open-ended and the player can choose any strategy they wish to pursue.</p>",

        "description": "<p>An American football coaching simulation, Mac Pro Football's object is to put you down on the grass, pacing the side-line, banging your clipboard and shouting. It's a playoff game, maybe the championship; you get to choose the teams. Want to play the Packers against the Bears in 1980? Or the 1972 Dolphins against the 1985 Dolphins? Or maybe just the last quarter of Super Bowl X? The teams are all here, each team and key player rated with a single number, though you can build more detailed stats from your own games. Choose from nine or ten strategies at each play, out-thinking either a hot-seat opponent or three levels of computerized coaches. You can even draw out the pass pattern using the Mac's new point-and-click interface.</p>\n<p>The display is split four ways: (1) a play diagram exactly like your clipboard shows the line-up you've selected, and the motion as it plays out; (2) a gauge of the ball's position on the field; (3) a scoreboard with the details of the last play; and (4) a summary of play statistics to put numbers behind your gut instincts. A real-time play clock adds pressure to the simulation: you can change your mind, but it takes time to lay out the play again. Penalties are rare, and cannot be declined.</p>\n<p>Created over the course of four years by a former college player, the simulation evinces a love of the history of the professional game. You can replay the first twenty Super Bowls, guided by a technical reference typical of Avalon Hill's war simulations from the same era. Weather is detailed, for you to select, or the computer to generate, unless the home team has a dome. Uniquely, you can change the parameters mid-game, not just the weather, but even the score, time, down, and ball position. The focus is to challenge you as a coach to make the right decision, even if it's a guess.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mouse Stampede</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Centipede\">Centipede</a> variant where the centipede has been replaced by a pack of mice. The player controls his gun (which happens to look like a Mac mouse) freely around the lower sections of the screen while shooting at the pack of mice that moves down the screen one line at a time. The screen is also full of cheese that acts as obstacles affecting the mice's route. When a mouse is hit it oddly enough turns into cheese. There are also sleeping cats that when hit are awoken and start eating mice that are close. Various other enemies exist in the game including bats, stomping sneakers, knives, flies, paint brushes, turtles and falling shopping carts. The player has three lives and loses one when being touched by any of the enemies. An extra life is earned when reaching 15,000 points.</p>",

Version 2 is written for MacOS X and has high-resolution truecolour graphics, while the gameplay remains true to the original. Blobs must be stacked so that they form groups of four, upon which they disappear. If blobs are stacked above, they fall down, and skilled players can use this to form chain reactions for higher scores. There is a two-player option, and an option to play against the computer, in which clearing combinations and chains cause rocks to fall down on the opposing player's playfield, making life harder for the opponent.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Aqua Blooper Piper</em> is a pipe construction action puzzle game. The player takes the role of a plumber whose customer wants to take a shower. The problem is there is no water and it is up to the player to fix this by installing a water pipe that stretches between the two pipe connections on the left and right walls of the playfield. At the bottom of the screen is a conveyor belt that constantly sends out new pieces of pipe. Using the mouse the player drags these to the position where it should be placed and if a connection is possible it will automatically snap onto the existing pipe structure. The keyboard is used to rotate the pieces. Pipe pieces can only be connected to other pipe pieces with open ends.</p>\n<p>Once the player has completed the pipe he can pull the main faucet lever to start the flow of the water. Before doing so it's important to close off all open pipe ends or it will lead to a flood and the player will fail with his task. It's necessary to use as many pieces from the conveyor belt as possible. For every piece that moves all the way to the left end of the conveyor belt one automatic faucet lever will be turned on. There are four of these and when they all have been opened the main switch is overridden and the water will begin to flow. At level two or higher there is also a time limit of six minutes and when it is up the water is automatically switched on. There are five game levels from apprentice to wizard. Each new level adds more complex pipe pieces often with multiple open ends.</p>",

The player is on an archaeological expedition in search of a sacred idol. To find it the player has to make his way through the pyramid, which consists of six randomly generated levels, while at the same time battling the various evil creatures that lurk in the rooms and corridors of the tomb. </p>\n<p>The game is entirely played with the mouse and the screen is split into two views. On the left there is a first person view of the tomb and to the right is a map that is blank at the start but is automatically drawn as the player progresses through it. Among the corridors there are various objects that can be collected. Some of these like jewels and jewellery are just worth points while others are necessary to complete the game. To be able to find the idol the player first needs to get a key, a lamp, a knife and a score of more than 2000 points. Combat is in real time and when enemies appear the player has to quickly click on them or else the condition meter will decrease until it reaches zero. At the start the player is equipped with a staff but a knife and a sword can be found. Some back story is told through notes from previous expeditions that the player can find. Some of these also gives clues to what needs to be done.</p>",

There are fifteen levels in total each against one of the bar's customers.</p>\n<p><em>Grid Wars</em> is a fixed screen shoot 'em up that is viewed from a slightly tilted perspective. The player's laser cannon, which can be moved left and right, is located beneath the grid and on the other side is the opponent. There are two types of enemies that move around the grid: the grid nasties and the grid walkers. The objective is to prevent the grid walkers from reaching the player's end while at the same time avoiding crashing into the grid nasties. In front of the player are shields that hinder the progress of the grid walkers but are destroyed when hit by the grid nasties.</p>\n<p>Three different weapons can be used by the player. The main weapon is the laser cannon which works differently from other shoot 'em up in that projectiles are shot in a trajectory and not in a straight line. The two other weapons are torpedos which destroys all enemies in a grid row and vaporizers that destroy all grid nasties on the screen. These weapons are only available in a limited supply. </p>\n<p>To complete a level the player has to eradicate all the grid nasties. The game ends when a grid walker reaches the player's end of the grid or when all the three of the player's laser cannons are destroyed.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Astro Chase 3D</em> is a space shooter which transfers most gameplay mechanics of its predecessor <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/11328/astro-chase/\">Astro Chase</a> into a first-person perspective. In the future, aliens try to destroy Earth by sending Mega Mines toward the planet. Now the player needs to use the Ultraship and destroy those mines before they reach Earth!</p>\n<p>Each of the 40 levels takes place on a confined field in which the player needs to find and take out the mines - the level is lost if a mine reaches Earth or when the ship is destroyed by enemy fire. The most important tool is the radar which shows all important things the player needs to be aware of: Earth, mines, enemies and the position of space stations which give positive effects when approached: energy generators replenish the ship's energy, shield depots give temporary shields and power-up stations deploy extra weapons. There are overall four weapons available: a standard shot, a more powerful shot, energy seeking missiles and decoy mines which attract enemies. </p>\n<p>While the game offers different control systems for various input devices (mouse, keyboard or gamepad/joystick), the basic idea is that the ship moves forward on its own and the player only controls the direction. This allows to shoot independently from movement, although the player needs to enter a different mode in order to control the weapons. The ship's movement can also be halted completely. There are overall 40 levels, including five practice levels. Beating a level unlocks the possibility to start directly from five levels before (i.e. beating level 20 allows to start from level 15) after exiting the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Geometric Golfer</em> is an educational game about geometry that is loosely based on the sport of golf. Like in the sport, the player's goal here is to sink a ball into a hole but here both the ball and the hole are geometric shapes. The ball is a polygon with three to eight sides while the hole is made of two polygons. The ball is considered sunk when it surrounds the inner polygon of the hole and is fully within its outer polygon. To strike the ball the player can use five clubs that transform the ball in various ways. The translate club is used to move the ball and this is done by drawing a vector. It is then slid by the given amount vertically and horizontally. The reflection club is used to draw a line of reflection. It will then be mirrored on the other side of the line. The dilation club is used to shrink or enlarge the ball. The distance from each point to the center is then multiplied by the scale given by the player. Finally there are two rotation clubs, one clockwise and one counter-clockwise. </p>\n<p>The game consists of ten courses and most of them have nine holes. Like in the real sport the aim is to sink the ball in the least amount of strokes. The holes have two different obstacles: water and trees. Touching either of these will lead to a stroke penalty. The exception is when using the reflection club which allows the ball to traverse over water. In addition to the available courses it is also possible to design new ones through a in-game editor.</p>",

Graphics aside, the game is essentially identical to the original Pac Man. Ms. MacPerson (who is controlled with the keyboard) has to make her way through a maze, collect all the pills while staying away from the four ghosts that chases her. By eating special power pill things are turned around and she can go after the ghosts who then run away. A level is completed once all pills have been collected. The player has three lives and when they are used up it's game over. Like in the arcade original there are intermissions between some of the levels.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Blade, a guardian of Earth, has awakened from hibernation to find a strange, alien landscape filled with alien forces. You must travel through the changed world to find and stop the malevolent force that has invaded. </p>\n<p><em>Blade</em> is a screen-by-screen platform game, where the player controls the eponymous futuristic humanoid guardian. The player must collect teleportation pods to activate a teleporter that leads to the next screen, or \"act.\" The game contains 15 acts divided into 5 levels, including forests, caves, Blade's old base, and other strange landscapes. A variety of enemies and other obstacles will hamper the player's progress. Every third acts will contain a boss that needs to be defeated in order to continue. \"Stasis Pods\" hold power ups that can increase health, attack power, or apply other effects. The player uses a blade to attack while walking, crawling, or jumping. Attacking while jumping allows the player to flip and slightly increase their jump height. When at full health the player unleashes a more powerful attack.</p>\n<p>The game uses a very distinctive visual, illustrative style for its levels and character design, each screen showing a unique background and a wide variety of enemies to encounter.</p>",

His task is to retrieve a mystical orb which is located in an evil castle hidden deep within a forest of tangled trees.</p>\n<p>The game screen is split into two parts. The top half shows an image of the location while the bottom part has a textual description along with a text prompt where the player can interact with the game by entering text commands that start with a verb and may include nouns, adjectives and prepositional phrases, for example move the table, take the box, examine the book on the table. Navigation can be done by typing the direction the player wants to go but it is also possible to use the mouse and choose the desired item in a drop down menu. The game also uses a drop down menu to show the player's inventory although interaction with items is only possible through the prompt.</p>",

Moving the mouse left and right steers the skier while moving it forward puts it into a tucked position which leads to a lower center of gravity and higher speed but also higher risk of crashing when turning or jumping. Making sharp turns can lead to the edges of the skies digging in and which might lead to the player losing control. When reaching a jump the angle of attack has to be adjusted to compensate for rate of speed and center of gravity. When clicking the mouse the skier tucks its legs which is needed to maintain balance.</p>\n<p>There are three different skiers to race as, each with a different look as well as one that is computer controlled. The game has four different courses: Prima Vale, Big Dipper, Great Scott and Warm Springs. Each has a different rating indicating it's difficulty with Prima Vale being the easiest and Warm Springs the hardest. The player can choose from four ability levels from beginner to expert.</p>",

Since the airplane naturally seeks the floor it is necessary to use the wind coming from floor vents to gain height. Obstacles that have to be avoided include tables, candles and electrical outlets. Good items to touch are clocks which give points and sheets of paper which give extra gliders. If touching any obstacles the glider is lost.

In order to do so he has to pass all nine circles of hell.</p>\n<p>Other than you would expect from a Demon, Bill has no special skills or attacks, he can't even attack. He has a paralyzing shout which buys some time to flee from enemies or destroys some unstable walls. Over time or when shouting Bill becomes hungry and needs to eat human souls. Human souls are placed in the levels and can be consumed to refill he hunger bar. In addition, the player gets one extra life for every 25 souls consumed. This hunger feature forces the player to keep Bill moving, because otherwise he will die of starvation.</p>\n<p>There are several kinds of monsters on the way through the nine circles of hell, e.g. monsters coming out of the ground or large, flying eyes. After finishing one circle of the hell, the player gets a code which can be used to reload at the beginning of the cycle with exactly the same stats he had when reaching it.There are several checkpoints in the levels where Bill respawns after dying. The game is lost when Bill has no more lives left.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Operation: Desert Storm</em> is an action game that takes place during the Gulf War where the player controls a M1A1 tank from a top down perspective. The game contains twenty missions at different locations in Kuwait, Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia. In each mission the player has to complete the given objectives and reach a pickup location within a certain time. If being more than thirty seconds late penalty points will be given. </p>\n<p>The player will encounter three different Iraqi tanks (T-55, T-62 and T-72) as well as G-5 Howitzers, gunner stations, Mi-24 Hind helicopters and two different fighter planes (MiG-29 Fulcrum and Mirage F-1). There are also land mines and chemical weapons (mustard gas and hydrogen cyanide) to watch out for. A sensor warns the player when getting too close to a land mine while to get through a poison gas cloud it is necessary to turn on gas protection. When gas protection is on it is not possible to fire shells or missiles. The player has three lives and any contact with an enemy vehicle or their projectiles lead to one being lost. It's also necessary to keep track of the tank's fuel and it's possible to pick up fuel pods to refill.</p>",

Before his annihilation, Kendall's work in the Defense Department had grown unsatisfying for him, and so he instead devoted his time and efforts to the expansion of the ever growing cyberspace.</p>\n<p>In his latest project, he had created a way of designing a person's ego into the net, with such a cybernetic ego incorporating personality and intelligence in addition to tactile senses, using his own as a prototype. His attempt at doing so was a success, though Kendall never got a chance to reveal his findings to the world, as he was killed shortly after, awaking to see his family die at the hands of his murderers. Soon afterwards, Kendall's mind came to life again in the form of a cyberspace program.</p>\n<p>Throughout the game, the player controls Alex Kendall's cyberspace program of himself, seeking revenge of his family, and his own mortal self. The phrase \"Revenge is best served on the Net\" is shown in the opening titles before game play commences.</p>",

In each of the five stages, the player must beat its current champion's time to move on. Gameplay takes after classic Sega arcade racers like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10651/hang-on/\">Hang-On</a>; gameplay is presented using sprite-scaling, and the player controls their driver from a third person rear perspective. While there are many other drivers on the track, they're more obstacles than real opponents; the player's goal is time, not to get first in the race.</p>",

Its gameplay is presented through a mix of a point-and-click interface and a text parser. The player can click on items in the main game screen to interact with them.

Like in other games of its kind the objective is to protect a city from being destroyed by air attacks. The game is played with the mouse which is used to move a crosshair around the screen. Enemies will fly across the screen and drop projectiles towards the city which initially is protected by a force field. Clicking with the mouse or pressing the space bar launches a missiles from one of three missile bases (depending on which is nearest the target) which destroys any target that is within its range of explosion. As buildings are destroyed people fall from them onto the streets where ambulances will arrive and pick them up. The game ends when all buildings have been destroyed.</p>\n<p>There are several different types of enemies including balloons, helicopters and dive bombers. They all drop bombs that can do damage to the city if not shot down in time. There are also paratroopers which if they manage to reach the ground will run to a missile base and destroy it permanently. Missile bases that are destroyed by bombs are rebuilt for every new level. Firing missiles damages the city's force field while destroying a target restores it. Hence accurate shooting is rewarded.</p>",

Up to six players can battle simultaneously, using built-in level maps or add-on maps created by players and downloaded from the net. Three different mech configurations are available, varying in speed and loadout. There are also some single player scenarios for solo exploration. Action is either viewed first-person, from inside the mech, or third-person, from a flying drone that is player controllable.</p>",

Remains of a highly-advanced civilization were found when the city was built, in the form of \"mech\" technology. You play as a young samurai apprentice that begins to have ominous dreams about his father and must solve the mystery behind a group of mysterious ninjas.</p>\n<p>Samurai Mech's main quality are its amazing presentation and art work. The artist made full use of the Macintosh graphical abilities and created a gorgeous game, with each illustration, menu and even the combat screen building up to the game's \"Space-Japan\" aesthetic.</p>",

The game show is composed of four available rounds, which can be mixed and matched in any order and number. In Slap Happy, players must match as many pairs of photos as possible before time runs out, somewhat like Concentration. Zingers is a quiz game in which players connect squares in a line, tic-tac-toe-style, by answering trivia questions about the photos in the grid. The Hangman-inspired Blankety Blank involves choosing photos representing the correct letters to fill in a word or phrase. Finally, Scrambler is a swap puzzle.

Most of the paths end in disaster for our duo, but with humorous results!</p>\n<p>The game was created by Nick Longrich, who also went by the alias \"Norbik Nudley\", the filename of the HyperCard stack itself.</p>",

It superficially resembles Lode Runner but, unlike Lode Runner, the game is fundamentally turn-based rather than real-time, with an oxygen meter that drops with each step.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to collect the keys and then reach the exit door before your oxygen runs out. The game complicates this by including features such as oxygen refill tanks which may be necessary to complete the level without suffocating, trampolines, and various other mechanics.</p>\n<p>The shareware version allows you to play 10 levels, while the full version unlocks 100 levels, a level editor, and support for playing user-created levels.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Officially an add-on for the famous screen saver collection, After Dark (v2.0), <em>More After Dark: Volume 1</em> was Berkeley Systems' first foray into games with its inclusion of the module <em>Lunatic Fringe</em>, \"the exciting new space game from the creator of Solarian II.\" Although there was never any \"Volume 2\" of <em>More After Dark</em>, with the release of later editions of After Dark, more games would be included as screen saver modules. While After Dark was already a popular screensaver (arguably responsible for the screensaver craze of the 1990s), the games themselves proved popular enough to warrant a release of their own, known as <em>After Dark Games</em>, with games based on some of the other popular screensaver modules.</p>\n<p>The actual game that was included, called <em>Lunatic Fringe</em>, is a simple top-down space shooter. Once the screensaver module has been activated, the keyboard is used to control the your ship, which can be flown in 360\u00b0 space. As you explore, you encounter planets, asteroids, and enemy ships. From the mini-map you can observe when objects are approaching.</p>\n<p>You begin the game at your home base. You must return there from time to time in order to refuel and/or repair your ship. One of the more novel elements of the game is that different parts of your ship can be damaged to varying degrees and, when damaged past a certain threshold, each element will begin to misbehave in a unique way, such as a disabled blaster or misbehaving thrusters.</p>",

The player patrols the two-way scrolling landscape in his ship, disposing of aliens preventing them from abducting the humanoids. If the aliens manage to get a humanoid to outer space (top of the screen), it mutates and chases you down. You can rescue the humanoid by shooting the alien capturing it, but if it falls too far it will fall to its death. To avoid that your craft needs to swoop in to pick it up and return it safely to the surface. At the end of level, each surviving humanoid gives you a bonus score.</p>\n<p>Your ship is equipped with lasers and a limited number of smart bombs and the the top of the screen is dedicated to a long range scanner that shows the location of all enemies and humanoids on the level.</p>",

Like in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/169162/yaken-rodem/\">Yaken Rodem</a>, players guide him via the mouse, clicking on the screen to move him and interact with the other inhabitants of the park. Clicking on Rodem switches him between several different moods, allowing him to interact with the park's other inhabitants in different ways. For example, when in a friendly mood Rodem can befriend other creatures he meets, while in an angry mood he can get into fights. Rodem needs food to survive and can eat just about anything he comes across, but depending on players' choices his life can take a very different turn. A new addition to this game is the parasitization system, in which Rodem can become infected with one of a few fantastical parasites within the park. These grow into strange objects poking out of his head and can have different effects.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A take on the classic story of <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> starring Japanese singer and actress <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/1270042/eriko-tamura/\">Eriko Tamura</a>. She stars as Dorothy, who finds herself transported to a mysterious land following an accident in her home. Luckily, she has the help of a cowardly lion, a talking television and a living toaster to find her way back to her own world. This CD-ROM storybook has simple gameplay that follows a set formula. Each chapter, a story scene follows the characters on their journey as they encounter a new problem. At key moments, players can decide on the solution via multiple choice. Should they pick the wrong option, players won't lose the game; instead, they're simply given the option to try again. The game features prerendered CG art similar to Future Pirates' other games, but with a live-action Tamura interacting along with them.</p>",

Much like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/192204/refixion/\">its predecessor</a>, gameplay involves exploring a place filled with weird and surreal stuff going on, with no puzzles. It's played from a first-person perspective and presented as a series of still images and FMVs, the latter being both live-action and 3D animations.</p>\n<p>You start in the waiting room of the building, the titular museum or hospital, and as you get through the different passages and rooms you can look through the peepholes of different cells where short looped videos are played of costumed actors dancing. There are also strange 3D animations of what appear to be children, geometrical shapes, machines and other stuff, both inside the cells and elsewhere.</p>\n<p>In addition, there's a feature where you can play the different songs of the soundtrack.</p>",

The ship has limited shield to survive a loop, and has smart bombs which can clear the screen. </p>\n<p>After completing a loop, the player can land for bonus points, ship repairs, and weapon upgrades.   Bonus healing kits can also repair the ship when it becomes damaged, and damaged vessels may lose navigation or fire control.  Game speed doubles in Mega-Mode after the player reaches 100,000 points.  The player starts with five ships.</p>",

Armor, weapons, and hints from the bar can be purchased in towns.  </p>\n<p>The goal is to visit all seven pyramids around the land, and then visiting the Island of the Mystics between each ward gathered.
