        "description": "<p>Zeebo's version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=%E3%83%80%E3%83%96%E3%83%AB%E3%83%89%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B4%E3%83%B3\">Double Dragon</a> follows the same plot, but bearing several changes. Once again, Billy and Jimmy Lee are off to rescue Marian, Billy's girlfriend, kidnapped by Machine Gun Willy and his gang.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is the same as in <em>Double Dragon</em>, a beat'em up for one or two players. Billy and Jimmy can move in eight directions, jump, punch and kick. Several moves are available by combining those basic commands, such as running, head bumps, flying kicks, elbow punches, hair grabbing, etc. Some enemies will drop weapons when hit, which can be used by the players. The weapons available are knives, steel bats, whips, dynamite sticks, hand axes, flails and nunchucks. Oil drums found throughout the levels can be picked up and thrown at or kicked toward enemies for extra damage.</p>\n<p>The game was expanded from four to six missions, with only the first, second and the last taking place in the same locations as the arcade version, although bearing minor layout changes. The other 3 missions are completely new ones. Except for Willy, all enemies are new, though sometimes clearly inspired in the original ones. The graphics are also slightly more detailed than the arcade version, with a 16-bit touch.</p>\n<p>The game features an extra battle mode: after finishing the game with Billy (and Jimmy), players can replay the game as the baddies, summing up to 18 different unlockable characters. Each baddie has its own moves and some of them can use some of the available weapons. At first, only Billy, Jimmy and two baddies will be available; as the player finishes the game with different characters, more baddies are unlocked. There are three levels of difficulty and options to increase the amount of characters' lives and continues.</p>",

As the characters win matches, they grow on points which unlock new rackets (again in varied forms, such as a guitar, a rake, a pan, a broom, etc.). The game length and player's hand side can also be selected.</p>\n<p>The game features also an online ranking on Zeebo-net in which players can compare their achievements.

Players can select one out of four characters (with no influence to the gameplay). There are 3 courses available, located in Brazilian cities: Cambori\u00fa (easy), Piracicaba (medium) and S\u00e3o Roque de Minas (hard). The game features a one-on-one split-screen mode also.</p>\n<p>When controlling the game with the Z-Pad the upper buttons make the car drift. There is an accelerator button, a break button and a turbo button. Oil gallons are scattered through the courses and driving over them recharges the car's turbo (bigger gallons grant bigger recharges).</p>",

Players must swing the Boomerang to hit the ball while the characters move automatically around the court. The buttons are used to jump and to block. The d-pad on the Boomerang is used to change the camera view.</p>\n<p>One or two players can choose doubles among 10 characters dressed in the most various ways (like a geisha, a cook, a nurse, a man in a walrus costume, etc.). As the characters win matches, they grow on points which unlock new clothes. The game length and player's hand side can also be selected.</p>\n<p>The game features also an online ranking on Zeebo-net in which players can compare their achievements. The ranking can be updated daily by players.</p>",

It is the third title to exclusively use the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Boomerang\">Boomerang</a>, Zeebo's accelerometer controller (different from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/8913/zeebo-extreme-series/\">Zeebo Extreme series</a>, which also supports the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Z-Pad\">Z-Pad</a>; however, the game was later re-released to support the Z-Pad). Players must swing the Boomerang to throw the ball or to dodge while the characters move automatically around the court. The buttons are used to taunt and to pass the ball (when attacking) or grabbing it (when defending). The d-pad on the Boomerang is used to jump the camera view.</p>\n<p>One or two players can choose teams formed by 4 members. The team members all look identical, and they are the same characters from the previous games in the series. As the characters win matches, they grow on points. The player's hand side can also be selected.</p>\n<p>The game features also an online ranking on Zeebo-net in which players can compare their achievements. The ranking can be updated daily by players.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Un Juego de Huevos</em> (\"A Game of Eggs\") is based on the Mexican animation movie <em>Una Pel\u00edcula de Huevos</em>. The game has one of the movie characters, Confi, telling what happened in the quest of another egg, Toto, to become a chicken.</p>\n<p>The player controls Toto through 25 platform levels, divided in 5 stages which take place in locations such as the sewers, a forest, an icy mountain and a cave. Toto yields a lollipop as a weapon and he can jump, attack forward, up and down. After collecting a blanket, he can use it as a parachute to fall slowly. He starts with only 2 \"eggs\" of health (shown in an egg tray at a corner of the screen), but collecting golden-egg items will increase it up to twelve. The enemies faced will vary according to the stage (rats in the sewers, reptile eggs in the forest, shells in the cave, etc.), with a final boss at the end of each of the 5 stages. The objective of each level is to get to its end while collecting blue jewels. If all blue jewels in a level are collected, a giant blue jewel is awarded. Getting to the end of a level awards a giant red jewel. Beating a boss awards a diamond. Jewels are necessary to unlock levels. At the beginning of the game, Toto will be in a general world stage with only the level 1-1 will be unlocked, and the player has the option to go through the levels within a stage in the order he wishes, provided he has the amount of jewels needed to unlock the stages.</p>\n<p>The co-op mode adds Willy, a military egg, to the game. Willy can be added at any time through the in-game menu. He yields a club and has the same movements as Toto. Toto and Willy share the same screen and if one of them gets too far from the other, one of them disappears from the screen, with an arrow showing where he has been left.</p>\n<p>The game can also be played by two players competitively in a race mode, with ten unlockable competition levels. The races put Toto and Willy trying to reach the finish line first while collecting jewels. As they race, if one of them gets much ahead of the other, the other will get stuck in the edge of the screen. At the end of the race, the winner is the one with more points, calculated by the number of jewels taken, being the first to arrive at the finish line and the number of times the player got stuck.</p>\n<p>Finishing the game will unlock a new secret character and collecting all the jewels in the game will unlock another. The game features cutscenes between levels with voice-overs (in Spanish) by the same actors who voiced the characters in the movie.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Boomerang Sports Peteca</em> is, as the name implies, a peteca game, a sport similar to badminton, with the shuttlecock being hit with the player's hand instead of a racket. It is the fourth title to exclusively use the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Boomerang\">Boomerang</a>, Zeebo's accelerometer controller (different from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/8913/zeebo-extreme-series/\">Zeebo Extreme series</a>, which also supports the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Z-Pad\">Z-Pad</a>; however, the game was later re-released to support the Z-Pad). Players must swing the Boomerang to hit the ball while the characters move automatically around the court. Buttons 1 and 2 are used to move the player right or left before serving.</p>\n<p>One or two players can choose among 10 characters dressed in the most various ways (like a geisha, a cook, a nurse, etc.). As the characters win matches, they grow on points which unlock new items. The game length and player's hand side can also be selected.</p>\n<p>The characters move around the court in different speeds. Green (with a plus sign) and red (with a minus sign) frames of different sizes appear in the court floor, adding or subtracting speed from the player who walks over them (the bigger the frame, the greater the effect). A red bar near the players show their current speed. Players can try to throw the shuttlecock over a red frame forcing the opponent to walk over them, thus slowing him or her down.</p>\n<p>There are 4 possible courts. The default is a gymnasium one, while the other 3 can be unlocked if the player has any of the other previous Boomerang Sports games installed in his Zeebo.</p>\n<p>The game features also an online ranking on Zeebo-net in which players can compare their achievements. The ranking can be updated daily by players.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Hordes of Octo are back and are spread all over the 10 zones of the galaxy. It is your task to restore the freedom eliminating them.</p>\n<p>The goal in <em>Alien Breaker</em> is to destroy all battalions, represented by blocks on the screen, by bouncing a ball off of a horizontally moving paddle at the bottom of the screen. The blocks are colored and may change colors when hit, until they disappear. Levels are won by clearing all blocks from the screen and lost by letting the ball fall out of the bottom of the screen. This Zeebo version expands the previous <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/46669/alien-breaker/\">iPhone version</a> with twice the amount of levels and a new storyline.</p>\n<p>As some blocks are hit, 27 different bonus items can be released and fall down the screen. If the player catches them with the paddle, gameplay changes occur, like making the paddle bigger or smaller, adding a shield at the bottom of the screen, exploding a series of blocks, equipping the paddle with projectiles, etc. A female voice announces the changes that take place.</p>\n<p>There are four playing modes available: Arcade, Challenge, Versus and Fronton. The Arcade and Challenge modes comprise 100 levels divided in 10 zones represented by planets named after Greek letters (Alpha, Beta, Gama, etc.).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Zeebo F.C. Foot Camp</em> is a compilation of four soccer themed mini-games:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Goal Scoring</strong>: working with two teammates, the player has to score from the penalty mark. Points are awarded for goals scored and multiplied by consecutive goals scored. Extra points plates are shown inside the goal, which are awarded if hit. Some special power-ups are available; two of them are drawn at the start of each game. The power-ups for this game are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Points multiplier: multiplies the player's points while it lasts;</li>\n<li>Rebound: if the goalie palms the ball, one of the two teammates at the sides performs a rebound kick and scores;</li>\n<li>Chicken goalie: turns the goalie into a chicken who runs from the ball;</li>\n<li>Freezing ball: this ball will freeze the goalie for a while.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Free Kick</strong>: the player has to score a free kick against wind speed, goalie position, goal direction and barrier. Points are awarded for goals scored and multiplied by consecutive goals scored. The following power-ups are available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Points multiplier: multiplies the player's points while it lasts;</li>\n<li>Shrinking: shrinks the goalie and barrier for a kick;</li>\n<li>Abduction: aliens abduct all opponents for a kick;</li>\n<li>Freeze opponents: freezes the goalie and barrier for a kick.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Dribble</strong>: the player has to type a sequence of buttons displayed on screen to perform dribbles. The more accurate the sequence is done, the more beautiful the dribble is. The difficulty grows for each adversary, being the goalie the boss. Power-ups available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Points multiplier: multiplies the player's points while it lasts;</li>\n<li>Chicken opponent: turns an opponent into a chicken. The dribble is automatically successful;</li>\n<li>Hurricane Dribble: turns all dribble commands into directional spins;</li>\n<li>Freeze time: the time stops for a while, giving the player more time to perform a dribble.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Juggle</strong>: in this game, the player has to keep the ball in the air as long as possible, using his feet, knees and head to bump it. Points are awarded for ball time in the air and for variety of maneuver. The more a maneuver is repeated, the less points it awards. A flying bonus hen passes over the player from time to time; hitting it awards bonus points. The power-ups available are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Points multiplier: multiplies the player's points while it lasts;</li>\n<li>Saving hen: if the ball falls to the ground, the saving hen will put it in game again;</li>\n<li>Balloon ball: turns the ball into a balloon, making it fall slower that normal;</li>\n<li>Flock: causes a flock of flying bonus hens.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each mini-game has its own ranking, and there is a general ranking for all games. The game is played using customized avatars. Each avatar has 4 skills which can be developed up to the level 30. The skills are Strength (developed in the Goal Scoring game), Precision (developed in the Free Kick game), Reflexes (developed in the Dribble game) and Ball Control (developed in the Juggle game). The development of skills also unlocks 20 Achievements. Twelve achievements unlock 12 special uniforms and 3 achievements unlock extra content in the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/49642/zeebo-fc-super-league/\">Zeebo F.C. Super League</a>.</p>\n<p>This game is also the first to be compatible with <em>Zeeboids</em>, an app sold separately which allows players to create custom avatars (similar to Wii's Miis), which can be synchronized via the Zeebonet to be used in different Zeebo systems. When played using the Zeeboids, the game features an online ranking.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Ragor, a mad scientist, travelled to the past and kidnapped Kama, the chief's daughter. The two best warriors of the clan, Tork and Kral, are off to save her.</p>\n<p><em>Tork and Kral</em> is a platform game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7301/mario-bros/\">Mario Bros.</a>, with an ice age setting. The players have to kill all enemies in each level to complete it. The levels are stationary and the screen will only scroll vertically when the player climbs over the upper platforms. Some enemies move about the level (like dinosaurs, bears and bats) while others are stationary (like spore plants and snowmen). In some levels there are eggs which will spawn enemies regularly until destroyed.</p>\n<p>Tork and Kral can use their clubs to fight the enemies. There are two power-ups available for their clubs: fire and ice. Both work the same way, blasting fire or ice balls against the enemies, trapping them; the stronger the enemy is, the shorter they will stay trapped. There are also three kinds of special weapons which can be picked and used once: the gum, which allows Tork and Kral to release a bubble which can trap an enemy; the scream, which kills a wave of enemies in front of it; and the fart, which suffocates enemies while it spreads in the air. Other bonuses are:* Speed up: speeds up the character;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Freeze: freezes all enemies on screen;</li>\n<li>Fruit: increases the score;</li>\n<li>Zeebo Ball: makes the character invincible for a while;</li>\n<li>Thunder: kills all enemies on screen, making the player advance a level;</li>\n<li>1 Up: one extra life;</li>\n<li>Letters: collecting the letters E, X, T, R and A awards the player an extra life, making the player advance one level.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The game has 60 levels divided in three stages with 20 levels each, taking place in the forest, the mountain and the cave. Every fifth level is a bonus level, where the player has to climb platforms while taking fruits as the screen automatically scrolls up. Every tenth level is a boss stage, with a fire blasting mammoth to be defeated. The game can be played by one or two players cooperatively. There is also an \"Escape\" gameplay mode, where the objective is to keep climbing the platforms avoiding to be catch by the forced scrolling screen.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Zeebo F.C. Super League</em> is a soccer game with several rules bended to give the game a more arcadey approach. It features teams of 5 players in non-stop matches with no fouls and no balls out of play. Players can run, dribble, pass, shoot and hit the opponents. When shooting, the longer the button is pressed, the stronger the kick is; when passing, the player can choose to make it a low or an aerial pass.</p>\n<p>When assembling a team, the player can make a new captain or import one of his/her <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Zeeboids\">Zeeboids</a>. If previously trained on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/46709/zeebo-fc-foot-camp/\">Zeebo F.C. Foot Camp</a>, the Zeeboid will retain its attribute levels from that game. By using the Zeeboid the player also participates on an online ranking and can keep track of achievements unlocked during the game. The team uniform and name can also be customized, and winning games develop the team's attributes (strength, reflexes, precision and control).</p>\n<p>The player can select the length of games (with 2, 4 or 8 minutes) and if special powers will or won't be allowed. There are five special powers available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mega-Ball: the ball knocks down everyone in its way.</li>\n<li>Wall: a wall is put in front of the goal, stopping any ball, even the Mega-Ball.</li>\n<li>Giant: the character being controlled by the player grows into a giant, being immune to hits or stunning (even by bombs).</li>\n<li>Crazy Chicken: a crazy chicken invades the field and takes the ball to the opponent's field.</li>\n<li>Bomb-Ball: the ball turns into a bomb, stunning the nearby players.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The game features 3 game modes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Campaign: in this mode the player develops the team's attributes and unlocks new opponents as he/she advances in game. There are 5 different leagues in this mode, with 5 stadiums and 5 final bosses (Aztec, Pirate, Zombie, Robot and Boy). The player wins trophies for each league won. There are 3 difficulty levels in this mode: Pro, Champions and Stars.</li>\n<li>Tournament: the player can arrange a tournament with 4, 8 or 16 teams.</li>\n<li>Quick play: a quick game with any of the available teams.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The game can be played in single player mode, two players in opposite teams or two players in the same team.</p>",
