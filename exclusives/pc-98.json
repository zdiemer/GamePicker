        "description": "<p>This is a sequel to the first <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Farland+Story\">Farland Story</a> game. After Arc and his friends have defeated the evil Demon King, the brave knight was chosen to be the next king, and the lovely priestess Ferio agreed to be his wife. On the day of coronation, Arc and his little sister recall the events of the grand battle, when suddenly they hear a noise from the shrine with the Hole Sword. When they rush there, they find out the sword was taken away by demons. So, was the Demon King not defeated by Arc after all?</p>\n<p>The game looks very similarly to its predecessor. The entire gameplay is dedicated to strategic battles, during which you navigate your large party in turn-based mode over the world map. Once you have issued commands to all your party members, it's the enemies' turn to act. You can attack enemies when they are in range of your weapon, or cast healing and offensive area spells. Your characters level up, can use items, and equip a variety of weapons and armor pieces.</p>",

One day the queen Ferio finds an unconscious young girl near the castle. The girl has lost her memory. In a terrible nightmare, she hears the voice of a demon lord, calling her \"Fana\". Beside this name, she cannot remember anything. Ferio asks her husband, the king Arc, to take Fana to a nearby city and to visit the archbishop, who might know more about Fana's past. The two are unaware of the grave dangers which await them because of this decision...</p>\n<p>The third in the row of Farland Story games, \"Tenshi no Namida\" looks and plays very similarly to the first two games. You navigate your party over the world map in turn-based fashion. After you have assigned commands to your party members, it is the enemies' turn. You can attack physically when enemies are in range of your weapon, or cast spells - each character in your party belongs to a certain class and specializes in different type of combat. You gain experience points directly from hitting an enemy, even while counter-attacking, and can therefore level up in the middle of a battle.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This Farland Story game (chronologically the fifth in the main series) tells a story which is not directly connected to the adventures of Arc and his friends (told in the first three games). In this game, you control Kushna, the 17-year-old princess of Sardis. Two important people wish to marry her: the young Shacliff, prince of the neighbor kingdom Rulphan, and the count Geruda. However, the princess feels she is too young to marry anybody, and escapes the castle, dreaming to find a quiet place where she could practice martial arts. The situation changes somewhat when she accidentally meets prince Shacliff himself and discovers he is in fact quite a nice fellow. And meanwhile, horde of monsters invaded the castle, and there are rumors about a rebellion... </p>\n<p>Although it has a completely different story line, this Farland Story game plays and feels exactly like its predecessors. Once again, you control a party which you can freely move on the battle terrain in turn-based mode. You first assign commands to all your party members, and then wait while the enemies execute their turns. Both you and the enemy automatically counter-attack whenever the attacker is also within the weapon's range. You gain experience points needed for leveling up directly after each attack.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The sixth in the row on Farland Story games, \"Kamigami no Isen\" is set in a different world than the rest: a retro-style, Western-like environment with elements of sci-fi. You control a thief named Grey, who one day gets caught \"in flagrante\", and is saved by a girl named Elicia. It seems that Elicia and her sister have to escape the house, persecuted by enemies. Grey decides to help the sister, and gets involved in a conspiracy he would never dream about.</p>\n<p>Despite having a totally different story and setting, this Farland Story game still looks and plays more or less exactly the same as its predecessors. You have a party which you navigate on the screen in turn-based mode, assigning commands to it (such as \"Move\", \"Heal\", etc.) Some characters have special commands (like \"Sneak\" for Grey). Whenever you and the enemy attack each other, a short animated attack sequence is shown. You can use various types of terrain to your advantage (different for each character type). As in previous Farland Story games, you gain experience points directly after performing any action in a battle.</p>",

She must find other girls with supernatural powers to aid her on her quest to defeat the evil.</p>\n<p><em>Filsnown</em> plays like a standard top-down Japanese RPG: the party of heroines roams the world map, descend into dungeons, fight random enemies in first-person perspective combat using regular attacks or magic, and visit towns and villages to buy supplies and to rest.

Aided by these three dragons (who look like cute young girls and are called Aka, Ao, and Ki, which means, respectively, \"red\", \"blue\", and \"yellow\" in Japanese), Silk has to venture into a magical dungeon and to defeat the evil lurking inside. </p>\n<p>The game is a dungeon crawler with pseudo-3D graphics, random enemy encounters, and turn-based combat. The player has control over the party of four girls, who have different characteristics in physical strength and magic casting.</p>\n<p>There is some mild erotic content (innuendos and skimpy clothing), but no explicit nudity or sexual situations.</p>",

However, once he finds out that his sweetheart Adiana is a descendant of an ancient god, and that young men of the village participate in a dangerous ritual in order to be chosen as her husband, the hero decides he must act. Little does he know that this would just be the beginning of a long adventure, involving all this stuff he is not interested in... plus lots of pretty girls!</p>\n<p><em>Jinn: Eternal Hero</em> is a Japanese-style RPG with randomly appearing enemies and turn-based combat, with an unusual (for Japanese RPGs) perspective: the entire game uses first-person view, including town and dungeon navigation, similarly to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Bard's+Tale\"> Bard's Tale</a> games, in pseudo-3D environment. The game has several cutscenes that include nudity and sexual situation.</p>",

Demons who looked like pretty girls have appeared, driving people insane. Five kings have sent brave heroes to find a magical stone that alone could restore peace to the world. One of these heroes is Lucido. Aided by a simple village girl, he bravely descends into a dungeon full of seductive monsters - but he should beware of the competition...</p>\n<p><em>Themm</em> plays very similarly to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=raidy\"> Raidy</a> games: it is one big first-person dungeon crawl (solo) with randomly appearing enemies and turn-based combat. The enemies are, as the story implies, pretty and female; they disrobe upon defeat, which would already qualify this game for the adult genre, even if it weren't for the boss enemies who engage in full-fledged sexual activity with the hero.</p>",

        "description": "<p>No, this game has nothing to do with Harlem (the title is a misspelling of <em>harem</em> by the Japanese developers), but rather with ancient China. Basically, it makes fun of some of the most venerable Chinese myths, presenting legendary pseudo-historical characters in a comical and obscene way. The story begins as a young warrior named Li is playing \"peeping Tom\" with the goddess/empress Xiwangmu, the Queen-Mother of West. Enraged by Li's actions, the old court magician Taishang Laojun casts a spell on him, turning him into a woman. Now the poor guy has to find a way to reverse to his true macho self - but not before he defeats the best female warriors of the country in combat...</p>\n<p><em>T\u014dgenky\u014d</em> is an adventure game with strategic battles. The player navigates Li through the top-down world; dialogues are displayed as still shots with menu choices, viewed from first-person perspective, typically for Japanese adventures. At certain points Li will have to fight other girls. The battles are turn-based. Both Li and the enemy character are dealt a deck of cards. The player has to choose a card (attacking, healing, etc.) for the attack move, and click on a rapidly spinning additional card to enhance the attack - or make it fail. During the enemy turn, the player also must click on a card, with different results.</p>\n<p>The game features a lot of explicit sexual situations, some of which are quite \"hardcore\".</p>",

Even long after the collision, due to the distortion of gravity, volcano eruptions, earthquakes, and other disasters continued to occur. Civilization has shrunk into small cities spread across vast wasteland. The level of violence has raised beyond the imaginable.</p>\n<p>In such a terrible world, the 18-year-old musician named Damian has to earn his living by playing piano in a bar in the city of Gunu. One day, something falls on the Earth right in front of him - this \"something\" being a girl named Nicole, who apparently arrived from the mysterious meteorite. The first task assigned to the hero, if you haven't guessed it, is to get Nicole some clothes. Naturally, this soon develops into a much more sinister story musicians usually don't get involved into...</p>\n<p><em>Half-Pipe</em> differs from traditional Japanese RPGs in several aspects. Even though there is a party (up to four people), during combat the player has to choose one character at a time. Most of the battles are random, but there are many that can be triggered by talking to a character. The battles are turn-based and are viewed from first-person perspective. Damian is controlled by the player, while the other three (all girls) are controlled by the AI. Only when Damian's HP reaches zero, the game is over. Damian can use a variety of attacks (punches, kicks, etc.). There are no weapons or armor in the game. Even though there is an overworld map heroes can travel on, much of the action happen in the large cities, which take time to explore.</p>\n<p>Female characters disrobe when defeated in combat, and there are plot-related cutscenes with explicit sexual situations.</p>",

But fate had other plans for the boy: one step on the wrong stone, and Root falls through a dark pit into the underground world. Looks like it won't be simple for him to find the way home, because this world is populated by girls, each one of which wants something from him...</p>\n<p><em>Escape</em> is an adventure game in Japanese style: it has no real puzzles, and has to be solved mainly by talking to different characters and taking some decisions. Unlike many other Japanese adventures, \"Escape\" is viewed from top-down perspective and allows the player character to walk around and to explore the rather large, sometimes maze-like locations. There are also different endings in the game, depending on the player's choices during it. The game contains explicit sex scenes.</p>",

Time has passed, and the sword was inherited by the descendants of the hero. The two last ones are brothers, named Cain and Abel. While Abel has proved himself as a great warrior, Cain prefers to stay in his home village and chase pretty girls. But one day, he has a strange dream. A woman who calls herself the Goddess of Time appears and tells him that Gargantua is about to be revived. Cain first tries to ignore the dream, but soon a series of strange events convinces him that the time has come to prove himself a hero.</p>\n<p><em>Harlem Blade</em> is a rather traditional Japanese RPG with top-down navigation (can be done with arrow keys or in a point-and-click fashion with the mouse) and a world-map with linear routes. Enemies appear randomly, with battle screens superimposed on exploration backgrounds. It is possible to speed up the battles by setting them on Auto. Characters level up, buy equipment, use magic and items, and otherwise follow standard Japanese RPG procedures, with the addition of scenes that contain nudity.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The hero of the game is a seemingly ordinary man named Kaneda Momezo. But in fact he is not an ordinary man at all, but a superhero called \"Mokkoriman\", a name which is derived from the Japanese word for the \"splash!\" sound usually associated with sex. Young girls have been kidnapped and turned into seductive, but deadly monsters, who kill people with lethal attacks called SEX. It's time for the Mokkoriman to show his true face! With the help of his two superhero-aiding pretty girls, Mokkoriman is out for justice, revenge, and mutual SEX.</p>\n<p><em>Mokkoriman RPG</em> mostly plays like a traditional top-down Japanese RPG, with world map, random turn-based battles, party management, levels, equipment, and everything else, albeit with a definite comedic undertone: the enemies are naked girls, regular attacks are called \"sex\" (with choices of one-on-one or group), instead of magic there is \"dirty talk\", and health is restored by reading Japanese porn magazines. </p>\n<p>The game is very heavy on explicit sexual content; even during regular battles the attacks are animated in a very suggestive way. The game marks the beginning of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Illusion\">Illusion's</a> career as the maker of interactive sex scenes. The sexual encounters in <em>Mokkoriman RPG</em> have their own gameplay, which involves manipulating the mouse to simulate the movements of the player character during intimate moments. Some of the sex scenes are animated, making the game a RPG pioneer in this field.</p>",

Liann has retired since then, hoping to have some peace for himself. But once a hero, always a hero: an aggressive nation from the West threatens the country, and help is needed. Liann arrives at the city of Strahl to talk to the local king, and hooks up with an elf girl named Din who is willing to accompany the hero on his travels...</p>\n<p><em>Amaranth II</em> is the second in the series of action-based RPGs. The party roams the world in top-down fashion, levels up and buys equipment, just like in the first game. Attacks are performed by bumping into enemies, who can be seen on the screen before either the player or the enemy initiate combat.</p>",

There is a wide variety of different units, including jets, helicopters, tanks, etc. Whenever a unit approaches an enemy unit, it can perform an attack, assuming that its weapons remain in range. Attacks are displayed as separate screens, graphically displaying the results. The player can choose to give up when it is clear that there are no chances for victory. Either way, a successful invasion of the opponent results in Game Over.</p>",

        "description": "<p>After the Earth became devastated by pollution and other disasters, humans started building space colonies. The majority of human beings were born in space since then. But their health was much worse than the health of average human being born on the Earth before. Scientists have developed a unique technology on the second oldest space colony, named T2 (oddly enough, just like the Japanese company who made this game). But something went terribly wrong, and soon the scientists realized that they were killing human beings with the new technology. The project leader was killed, and a man named Nakajima took the power into his own hands, intending to continue the experiment for his own destructive purposes. One of the scientists contacted then a young female hunter, a special agent trained in armed combat, to help him track down the bad guys and to stop the experiment.</p>\n<p><em>Binyu Hunter</em> is a shooter in which the player controls the young heroine, her back always turned to the player, moving her horizontally, shooting enemies with the left mouse button and reloading with the right. Double-tapping left and right arrow keys results in the heroine diving and jumping to the side. There is a variety of enemies to deal with, from stationary regular soldiers to snipers, grenade-tossing enemies, enemies with protective shields, bosses with special techniques, etc. Each stage typically consists of many enemy waves coming in different patterns and with increasing difficulty.</p>\n<p>The story of the game is told through anime-style cut scenes. Once a shooting stage is over, the player is taken to a separate screen that allows him to choose a picture of a pretty girl, usually absolutely unrelated to the plot. Pictures of those girls appear on the screen, with less and less clothes, and the player can scroll, aim with the mouse, and capture a \"photo\" of the girl, which will then be saved in the gallery (accessible from the main menu).</p>",

        "description": "<p>The year is 1928. The First World War has devastated the world. But life goes on, and people try to forget the horror of wars. The hero of the game is a simple, young Japanese man named Koshino. He is a member of the crew of a huge ship that carries on board prominent people from different countries. It sails from Japan to America, via the Mediterranean Sea. Before long the hero gets acquainted with the passengers of the ship - all from different countries, most of them pretty young girls, and some of them having their own hidden agenda. Meeting suspicious people on the ship brings Koshino to conclusion that something will go very wrong - unless he interferes and investigates, at the same time trying to seduce as many young foreign ladies as possible.</p>\n<p><em>Blind Games</em> plays like a typical Japanese adventure. Most of the gameplay involves going around the ship (actually jumping from screen to screen by choosing the \"Move\" command in the menu), bumping into people and triggering events. The standard interaction are menu verbs Move, Look, and Think; however, many scenes have context-sensitive commands and dialogue choices, that lead to branching story-line - mostly involving which girl Koshino will have sex with and which he will leave in peace.</p>",

And that she would swear to destroy humanity...</p>\n<p>Only one person can stop the Grand Master. A simple young human boy named Nemo, but with mysterious ties to the race of Elves. When his father is killed by the Grand Master's minions, he knows that it's not just about saving humanity - it gets personal!...</p>\n<p><em>Elemental \u014c</em> (\"Elemental King\") is an RPG with several distinct features. For once, there are no random or regular battles - Nemo can freely roam the vast overworld map without fear of being attacked. Navigation is done in top-down fashion, while battles are viewed from first-person perspective. The pre-set battles (mostly against female elves) take place on a separate screen, and utilize a card system. Nemo can buy (or acquire from treasure chests or from other characters) cards, which stand for weapons, armor, magical spells, and items usually used in RPGs. Cards have their own elemental properties, so when choosing cards in battle, the player should pay close attention to the elements of the opponent's cards. It is also possible to fuse two or more cards into a more powerful one by using special cards. </p>\n<p>The game is controlled entirely with the mouse. Like many other Japanese DOS games, <em>Elemental \u014c</em> contains nudity and sexual situations.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The story of <em>Harenochi Munasawagi</em> does not start in a very original way: the protagonist is a high-school boy named Kazuhiko, who is - surprise! - permanently horny, displaying his \"affections\" at any given opportunity to anyone young and female, including even his childhood friend Chihiro. But while the focus on the story is on Kazuhiko and his quest for physical intimacy (which often results in girls getting angry and beating him up), there are other rather disturbing elements that come into play later - in particular, bunny-like demons who share Kazuhiko's passion for the opposite sex...</p>\n<p>The game is a typical Japanese adventure gameplay-wise, with the interaction consisting of choosing verb commands from a menu, often needing to deplete all the options before being able to proceed. There is also navigation on the map of the town and the high school (menu-based). Most of the commands are of \"Look\" and \"Talk\" variety, but they get much more specific when it comes to Kazuhiko \"interacting\" with the girls. There is no point-and-click interface even there, though; the entire game is played by choosing menu commands.</p>",

The problem is that these resistance fighters - all of them young pretty girls - have been brain-washed by PSYCO. There is only one way.

The player begins the game with Kazuya and Henry alone, but afterwards more and more girls join the party after having been... erm... treated by Kazuya's wondrous psyche-restoring skills. Most of the battles are against government parties, which consist of various character classes (soldiers, mages, robots, etc.). The player's party also acquires different talents over the course of the game: a healer, a shotgun-wielding character, etc. When characters attack each other, an animated sequence is displayed.</p>\n<p>Several stages are dedicated to defeating future female companions. Afterwards, the game switches to sex scenes, some of which have point-and-click interface and require specific actions from the player, while others utilize simple command-based menus.

        "description": "<p>The sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=horny+sweeper+koushoku\"> K\u014dshoku Shikakenin</a> tells us what happened to the brave hero Kazuya after he has overthrown the evil regime in the first game (and have had sex with many women on the way). One day Kazuya goes outside, enjoying the good weather, when an unknown girl appears and says she is the sister of Mai, one of the heroines of the first game. It looks like PSYCO, the evil brain-washing power, is back! And not just anywhere, but in a girls high school! Kazuya readily agrees to liberate the poor girls from the curse of PSYCO - probably because he knows too well that the only way to do it is by having sex with the afflicted girl...</p>\n<p><em>Horny Sweeper 2: Joshik\u014d Kiki Ippatsu</em> plays very similarly to the first game. It is a top-down turn-based strategy game in which the player navigates Kazuya and the... ahem!.. liberated girls on the large battle fields and attacks when enemies are in range. The difference is that in the sequel, characters gain experience points from each attack, rather than automatically leveling up after large battles, which grants this game a definite role-playing angle. There are more girls (including old acquaintances from the first game) and more attacks to choose from - but the hentai scenes are not interactive this time.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Sei Senshi Mokkoriman</em> opens the line of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Mokkoriman\"> Mokkoriman</a> games. Mokkoriman is a super-hero. Perhaps a little unusual one. You see, Mokkoriman is famous for his... how should I say that... manly powers. That's why he is called \"sei senshi\", which means <em>sex warrior</em>. Mokkoriman is determined to make women happy (or so he thinks) by having sex with them. But the path to each beautiful woman is filled with dangerous creatures and traps. Death awaits our hero at every corner, so he must prove that his other super-powers - jumping and shooting - will be as effective as his main talent...</p>\n<p>An early game by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Illusion\"> Illusion</a>, \"Sei Senshi Mokkoriman\" marks the beginning of this company's long tradition of fusing mainstream game genres with sex scenes. This particular game experiments with <em>platform genre</em>. It is a full-fledged platformer with complex levels that have to be solved in a unique way: there are teleporters that connect various areas of the level, and Mokkoriman can use them only if he has gathered enough energy - which he does when defeating enemies. If his energy count is too low, he should return and fight more enemies (which respawn on each screen). Mokkoriman has no melee attack: he shoots small energy balls at enemies. Various upgrades can be found, which enhance Mokkoriman's shooting abilities, making him shoot two or more balls. Rather than instantly dying when hit by an enemy, Mokkoriman has a proper health bar. Health packs are also scattered around. </p>\n<p>Each level ends with a sex scene between the hero and the \"boss girl\" of the level. Trademark interactive sex scenes make their first appearance in this game, though in a rather basic form: the player has to hold a mouse button and quickly drag the mouse, imitating Mokkoriman's movements on screen. The goal is to fill the girl's \"pleasure meter\", while not running out of \"spirit\", as the game calls it (read: premature ejaculation is not an option!).</p>",

        "description": "<p>The third <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Mokkoriman\"> Mokkoriman</a> game is perhaps <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Illusion\"> Illusion's</a> most unusual genre experiment: a <em>fishing game with sex</em>. No, there is no sex with fish in this game. Instead, the super-hero Mokkoriman (his super-power being his unparalleled ability to sexually satisfy women) and his two female side-kicks that were fighting together with him in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/43060/mokkoriman-rpg/\"> Mokkoriman RPG</a>, Oppain and Futomomon, have to fish (literally) women out of pools, bath tubs, etc. The player can choose to control either of the three, even though it doesn't affect the gameplay. It is possible to choose one of the seven available stages (each with a different woman) right from the beginning, with the eighth stage (\"office lady\") hidden. The fishing simulation part consists of two parts, both fairly simple. The entire game is controlled with the left mouse button. First, the player has to click at the right time when the hook is deep in the water. Then the woman will be pulled out of the water, caught by a part of her clothes. The player is taken to a new screen, which requires him to press and hold the mouse button, releasing it at the right moment and then pressing again, to successfully pull up the woman. </p>\n<p>What follows next is a regular point-and-click sex simulation (no Illusion-style real-time mouse movement), which involves clicking on the woman's different body parts to make her enjoy. Afterwards, the player is taken back to the pool. Each level has three different series of pictures depicting the player's \"fishing\" activities. They appear randomly, and the level can be considered completed when the player has unlocked all three.</p>",

The young man tells her that his name is Graffy, and... but that's all he can remember. Just his name, and the name of his cute strange pet animal - Lippen. Crith says that he was found unconscious outside of the village. Graffy is naturally eager to restore his memory, but there is more pressing business: it appears that the gods are angry at the villagers, and demand a human sacrifice, which has to be Crith. Graffy is determined to protect the girl, but there is only one way: to descend into the gods' temples and to find out why they are angry...</p>\n<p><em>Mug-R</em> is a first-person dungeon crawler, the gameplay focusing on exploring and mapping (with an automap) the maze-like temples. The party of playable characters - Graffy, Crith, and Lippen - fight randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat. they gain experience points and level up in standard RPG fashion. Other RPG elements are somewhat reduced: there are no magic spells at all, and item usage is limited. The game contains explicit sexual scenes.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Mr. M (whom true fans of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Illusion\"> Illusion</a> games will certainly recognize as the one and the only <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Mokkoriman\"> Mokkoriman</a>) is an alien who looks like a human being. Since he is a super-hero, his main concern is to save people - most importantly, women. For Mr. M, \"saving\" is synonymous with \"sexually satisfying\". There are beautiful women on remote planets that have not experienced the joy of true sexual satisfaction. Only one man can save them - Mr. M's friend, the famous Space Gigolo, Red Cobra, the one who \"lives and dies for love and justice\"! And he has just the right tool - an intelligent sex toy named Pakki! But alas, not all is simple: the sexy, but deadly intergalactic warrior Mangoose and her minions will do everything possible to stop Red Cobra! Be vigilant, hero!</p>\n<p>Usually just called <em>Red Cobra</em>, this game is yet another Illusion-made genre experiment. This time, we are talking about <em>space shooter with sex</em>. The player controls Red Cobra's spaceship in a pseudo-3D scrolling environment. The gameplay is what one would expect from a space shooter: shoot everything, avoid enemy blows, grab the power-ups, beat a boss, finish the stage. Everything is controlled with the mouse: moving it moves the ship on screen, holding the left button fires at enemies. There are three selectable difficulty levels. </p>\n<p>The game also has extensive, story-heavy cut-scenes between the shooting levels, with plenty of dialogue and - naturally - sex scenes. The sex scenes in this game are quite mild (especially for Illusion) and mostly involve women \"rescued\" by Red Cobra using the sex toy Pakki for... well, what sex toys are usually used for. Some of these scenes are animated.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The protagonist of the game is an ordinary Japanese man who lives together with his pretty wife Harunako. Two years after their marriage, they decided to move into a mansion in the suburbs. Everything seems normal when the couple arrives. But very quickly they both become involved in sexual intrigues, and witness strange events - mostly of sexual nature - that occur in the presence of their neighbors. Looks like the quiet family life they were hoping for will never become reality...</p>\n<p><em>Ura Mansion Hakkin</em> is an adventure game with very limited interaction, which mostly plays like \"choose-your-adventure\" book. The protagonist is automatically taken to different locations and through the story; however, many scenes offer the possibility to make a choice, selecting a corresponding command from the menu. Some of these choices just involve choosing different ways of sexual intercourse, while others propel the story into a different direction. The game is very heavy on explicit sexual content, the majority of its scenes being depictions of sexual encounters the hero witnesses or participates in.</p>",

        "description": "<p>An ordinary Japanese high-school student named Hatsumi Tarou was having a normal life - preparing for examinations, like all his classmates - when one day everything changed: it was on the day when he saw a talking cat. The cat promptly explained that it was not a cat, but a creature from the Magic World. Once in a thousand or so years, a fighting competition is being held between the best female fighters of the Magic World. The winner becomes the next queen. The referee however should be a human being; and this time, the honor belongs to our friend Tarou!</p>\n<p><em>Valkyrie: The Power Beauties</em> is a fighting game. The \"fight mode\" allows the player to fight against any of the opponents (controlled by AI or the second player). The \"story mode\" is single-player only. It has cut-scenes and dialogues between the fights, which are dictated by the story events. Tarou is helping one of the girls to defeat all the opponents one by one. The fights take place in different locations, but follow the same structure: win two rounds and advance to the next stage. The opponents (all female) have each a distinct fighting style, including some long-ranged attacks and magical spells. It is possible to jump, punch, kick from different positions (also crouching), grapple the opponent, or use special techniques. </p>\n<p>After the fight is won, the defeated girl asks the \"referee\" to have sex with her. The sex scenes mostly consist of two or more pictures of the girls. Some scenes allow the player to choose what to do, but overall the interaction is minimal.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Viper BTR</em> is a direct sequel to the short story that was part of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/43492/viper-v12/\"> Viper V12</a>, <em>Magical Gambler</em>. The original story was about a little girl named Ruri who received a magic wand from two dice-shaped familiars, and as a result turned into Chiyomi, a sexy gambling queen who abused her new powers to win money. In <em>Viper BTR</em>, the familiars return and give Ruri another chance to use her powers for good. However, she encounters Mai, another girl who underwent a similar transformation, thanks to her own familiar Domino. But unlike Ruri/Chiyomi, Mai uses her power for good. Will the heroine be able to join her or will envy and greed control her once again?</p>\n<p><em>Viper BTR</em> differs from other <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/8968/viper-games/\">Viper games</a> by incorporating a new genre into the usual \"choose-your-own-adventure\" gameplay, namely mahjong. There is an obligatory mahjong match in the game that the heroine has to win, and also a special \"mahjong mode\", accessed from the main menu. The rest of the game consists of pictures with text as well as animated sequences; however, unlike in other Viper games, there is rudimentary navigation in \"Viper BTR\" (at certain points it is possible to choose a location to go to from a menu list). Also not quite typically for a Viper game, the story of \"Viper BTR\" is not composed entirely of pornographic scenes, and the sexual content is milder than in any other Viper game before.</p>",

Instead of merely teaching a wrestler new moves, as was the case with previous <em>Wrestle Angels</em> games, the player now fully manages a team of female wrestlers, including matches, training, leisure activities, etc. The girls are recruited in the beginning of the game; afterwards, the player has to make a schedule for each girl, and also for their coach. The wrestlers' parameters may increase or decrease depending on the activities the player has chosen for them. However, most of the time, intense training (including running, weight-lifting, etc.) will raise their level greatly.</p>\n<p>The matches can be set on auto, trusting one's own training and preparation, or can be controlled manually by selecting moves from a menu. Either way, the outcome of the match is determined by the the level of the wrestlers' training much more than by the choice of moves in the match itself.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Wrestle Angels V3</em> is the seventh and final PC-98 title in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Wrestle+Angels\">Wrestle Angels</a> series, again featuring the in-depth management simulation style introduced in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/43623/wrestle-angels-v1/\">Wrestle Angels V1</a>. As usual, <em>Wrestle Angels V3</em> allows the player to train several female wrestlers, not only controlling their professional training, but also assigning free-time activities and taking them to different locations. All the girls have parameters that can be increased by training in different ways.</p>\n<p>Unlike <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/43623/wrestle-angels-v1/\">V1</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/60049/wrestle-angels-v2/\">V2</a>, this title is a completely new entry in the franchise rather than a remake. The familiar wrestlers from the previous games, led by the legendary Mighty Yukiko, have to unite against a new wrestler, who claims to have superior skills. The game has an even heavier emphasis on dialogue and adventure-like elements, with more locations and more personal involvement with the wrestlers. As before, the matches themselves are turn-based, and can be set on auto. This time around, the player can even choose not to see most of the matches displayed at all, with the exception of the most important ones.</p>",

Soon he encounters what might very well be the object of his quest - bathing in a spring in the middle of a forest. Before the hero can say a word, a female demon attacks. The hero scares away the demon, and the lovely girl, who turns out to be Sweet Pea, the daughter of the innkeeper of the village Twin Peaches, takes him to meet his father. But all goes wrong when Sweet Pea's soul gets stolen under mysterious circumstances. The hero descends into the huge underground dungeon in search for answers. And a young nobleman named Dendro, who claims to be Sweet Pea's fiancee, swears to find the soul before the hero does...</p>\n<p><em>Twin Peaches</em> is essentially a first-person dungeon crawler. The only movement is possible in the pseudo-3D environments of a huge, maze-like dungeon (with an auto-map feature). The enemies appear randomly; the battles are turn-based. Enemies are mostly young, pretty, female, and scantily clad (sometimes naked). Defeating enemies gives the hero money, experience points, and \"love points\", which increase his performance in battles.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The game's story is based on a fantasy novel of the same name by Hiroe Suga. In a world with two moons, humans peacefully co-exist with various species of intelligent animals, called \"mebu\". But something has destroyed the balance in that world, and animals have started to attack humans. A female warrior named Bizantira, accompanied by the yellow bird Diel, decides to find out the reason behind these occurrences and to discover the truth about humans and mebu.</p>\n<p>The game is a very basic Japanese-style RPG, with minimal story development and simple gameplay mechanics. The player controls Bizantira as she wanders around the top-down world map, exploring the world and visiting towns. There is no navigation in the towns; locations (such as weapons shop, inn, etc.) are selected through a menu. The battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective.</p>",

The captain ordered to fire the strongest weapons, but nothing could help: the aliens invaded the ship...</p>\n<p>...and in a unique twist, the player has to control an <em>alien</em>. No information is given about this playable character, that looks like a red crab. It starts at level 1, at the point where it invaded the ship. The game plays like a first-person dungeon crawler (this time the word \"crawler\" taken quite literally!). The alien moves through the pseudo-3D corridors of the ship. Crew members, robots and machines appear randomly and try to stop it. The battles are turn-based. The alien has two primary kinds of attacks at its disposal: physical attack (with its claw), and electricity attack. Defeating enemies brings experience points, leveling up the creature.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The events of <em>Agalta 3</em> immediately follow those described in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/43684/agalta-ii/\"> previous game</a>. The thousand-year old struggle, which began with the Demon King Zozem using the Powers of Chaos against the gods, is nearing its end. Three brave heroes - Ares, Seria, and Georgie - ventured into the World of Spirits to restore balance in the universe. As they continue their journey, a mysterious powerful magician attacks them. They are brought to the house of Dr. K., a local scientist. Seria becomes gravely ill; to save her, Ares and the Doctor go to the nearby forest in search of cure...</p>\n<p><em>Agalta 3</em> differs from the two previous installments of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Agalta\"> series</a> by eliminating random battles in favor of visible enemies who roam the world map and dungeon-like areas. When the controllable character comes into contact with an enemy, a battle ensues. The first-person-view battles are now completely turn-based, the turn indicator being displayed merely for convenience (enemies will not attack while the player is choosing commands from the menu).</p>",

Three such adventurers descended once into a mysterious cave - and no one has ever heard from them afterwards. Their children grew up and became adventurers themselves, members of the adventurers' guild: the boy Riva and the girl Emily. One day they are entrusted with a dangerous assignment: explore the so-called \"diamond cave\", grab the treasures, and report to the superiors. The young heroes do not now that this is just the beginning of a grand journey, during which they will discover the truth about what happened to their fathers...</p>\n<p>Made by the creators of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Emerald+Dragon\"> Emerald Dragon</a>, <em>Alvaleak Boukenki</em> is a Japanese-style RPG that plays almost entirely from first-person perspective (except short and linear transitions on the top-down map). All the locations (including towns) are displayed as dungeon-like areas. In dangerous locations (caves, towers, etc.), enemies appear randomly. The turn-based battles can be set on auto. The player-controlled party of characters (up to four) uses guns as their weapons; bullets must also be bought from weapon shops. There are no magic spells in the game. All the areas are auto-mapped as the player explores them.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Amaranth IV</em> continues the over-arching story of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=series\"> series</a>. The main heroine in this game is not Liann Fremdes, the usual protagonist of <em>Amaranth</em> games, but his lovely elf companion Din. After visiting the ancient city of Posse and meeting some new friends, Din heads to the capital city of Stellar to meet prince Deinass, whom she helped eight years ago during events described in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Phantasie+RPG+Amaranth+III\"> previous game</a>. But shadows from the past keep haunting the young prince. His sister is kidnapped by an old acquaintance. Din, Deinass, and their friends must do everything they can to bring her back and to stop a new threat to the kingdom.</p>\n<p>Similarly to the previous game, <em>Amaranth IV</em> contains elements of strategy RPGs: limited exploration, rare and story-dictated battles, and turn-based combat with free movement on the battle field. However, it gets rid of the \"vigour\" and action points system of the previous game, in favor of simpler gameplay. The player-controlled characters act in turns, and can usually move and execute a physical attack (or cast a spell) one time per turn. Some weapons require specific placement on the field (for example, bows require a character equipped with them to stand diagonally across the enemy in order to be able to attack). Character receive experience points and level up after defeating enemies; fallen character are resurrected to full health after battles. Instead of the usual top-down view, <em>Amaranth IV</em> uses isometric perspective for battles and exploration.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Amaranth KH</em> is a side-story in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=amaranth\"> Amaranth series</a>, and can be considered a prequel to all the previous games; it doesn't feature the same heroes, but is set in the same universe, at a much earlier time, when the kingdom of Stellar was not yet built and when Posse was a flourishing city. The game tells the story of Landschaft, a young warrior in the army or Rauschritt. He trains in the Posse camp with his best friend Dienstag and the lovely Jungfer. He is well-known for his courage, but he first needs to prove himself worthy of being a true night. It began as an educational battle for the young hero, but soon a chain of events forced him to fight for his life and for his country.</p>\n<p><em>Amaranth KH</em> is the radical conclusion to the series' tendency to strategy elements; it discards the RPG elements (movement outside of a battle screen, exploration, etc.) in favor of a traditional Japanese-style turn-based strategy game with a RPG angle (leveling up). The player commands Landschaft, his friends, and their units, moving them on the battle screen and attacking enemies when they are in their weapons' range. There are different types of units: infantry, cavalry, archers, magicians, etc. Some battle elements were taken from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/43703/amaranth-iv/\"> previous game</a> (such as archers attacking diagonally). Strong, story-related characters (generals) can fight alone against an entire unit of \"nameless\" characters. Every attack is displayed as a separate picture, graphically depicting ts results. If the attack is initiated by the enemy, the player can choose to counter-attack.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In th early 21st century, Tokyo became the center of advance scientific research. Ground-breaking discoveries were made in the field of computer science, as well as re-discovering the ancient art of magic. A crime organization known as <em>Digital Beast</em> emerged, controlling much of the new technological resources. The organization became so powerful that the authorities were unable to stop its activities. A mercenary named Lightning (or \"Light\" for short) recently joined a special group named <em>Black Bird</em>. One of his assignments involves investigating strange occurrences in the New Planning company building, which might lead him on the trail of Digital Beast.</p>\n<p><em>Black Bird</em> is a solo dungeon crawler (with auto-map feature): the gameplay consists of exploring maze-like passages in pseudo-3D environment, fighting randomly appearing enemies. The game features card-based combat. Lightning and his opponent are dealt a deck of cards. The goal is to get rid of single cards and to build combinations (three of a kind, straight, etc.), a bit similarly to a poker game. A successfully built combination inflicts damage on the enemy. There are also defense-strengthening and healing cards, which the player can use between the combinations. Beside that, the game has a traditional RPG system with hit points, experience points, leveling up, money management, equipment, etc.</p>\n<p>The adult content appears mostly during battles, with enemies who look like pretty girls and remove some (or all) of their clothes when defeated.</p>",

Was Balcan, the sorcerer killed by the great warrior Ares, the only one who knew how to stop evil? It's time for Ares to understand the meaning of Balcan's final words. Maybe the young sorceress Dela, still on a quest to avenge her teacher's death, can forgive Ares and join forces with him. Meanwhile, a new player appears - Unber, the female champion of Castle Town...</p>\n<p><em>Spirit of Balcan</em> has the same gameplay system as the previous entries in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=brandish\"> series</a>: the player navigates the character through the top-down world (the camera rotates with each turn of the player character), fighting enemies in real-time combat and gaining experience points. Characters can also visit \"friendly\" areas, where they can buy and equip weapons and armor. The interface is point-and-click, with selectable icons for looking, searching, and attacking. It is also possible (and sometimes necessary) to jump up and backwards. Unlike the previous <em>Brandish</em> games, <em>Spirit of Balcan</em> allows the player to control different characters, starting with Unber and later switching to Ares and Dela.</p>",

Legends say that powerful ancient wisdom is hidden in this tower. But no one dares to venture in, fearing ferocious monsters and deadly traps. Three people, however, are exception to this rule: the young thief Dee, who hopes to steal treasure from the tower; the lovely elf witch Clare, who needs to discover ancient magic; and finally, a mysterious man named Quien, who doesn't remember his past and works as a mercenary...</p>\n<p><em>Brandish VT</em> is the fourth installment of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Brandish\"> Brandish series</a>. It abandons the over-arching story of the previous titles and tells a completely unrelated tale. The player is able to choose Dee, Clare, or Quien as the playable character right from the beginning. Each one of them starts in a different location, but eventually will have to face the riddles of the Tower. The gameplay is similar to the previous Brandish games, with point-and-click interface (or keyboard short-cuts), real-time combat, and the ability to jump. As before, there is a RPG system with experience points and levels. The game abandons the top-down view of the previous games, using isometric perspective.</p>",

A race of demi-humans has emerged, threatening the existence of humanity. The 15th human Emperor, named Sigmatoro J. Salzstein, calls Duke Erich B. Zweiss, and explains to him the mission: recover ancient crystals from the demi-humans, which alone can save humanity. But the Duke should be careful: who knows what challenges await for him among the demi-humans, outside of the safe walls of the capital city Berlin?..</p>\n<p><em>Crystal Quest</em> is a puzzle game with adventure elements - the Duke's top-down movement and the ability to access different locations to tackle different puzzles. The locations are marked on the world map as towers and caves; in each one of them, a sexy demi-human will offer a challenge to the good Duke. The puzzles include a tile-matching memory game and a timed top-down maze sprint (find the exit before the time runs out). In each subsequent area, the difficulty of these puzzles increases, and the amount of clothes the demi-humans wear after a puzzle has been solved decreases.</p>\n<p>The music in this game includes famous classical compositions by J.S.Bach, Tchaikovsky, Satie, etc.</p>",

The game, however, doesn't follow this plot and instead is focusing on Crystania's internal troubles, particularly the evil Dragon God, whom the animal gods must defeat. The player can choose to play as either the female warrior Jenoba from the country of Istaria, or Pirotessa's former companion Boakes. The two adventures have different plots and begin in different locations. </p>\n<p>The game's exploration is on par with other Japanese top-down RPGs, including towns and hostile areas, but without a world map. The battles are pre-set. Once the player-controlled party encounters a hostile character, a turn-based battle begins. The combat has a strategy element, allowing character to freely move on the battle field and attack only if enemies are within the range of their weapons. Characters can cast magical spells or use \"talents\", which deplete TP, or \"talent points\".</p>",

        "description": "<p>A young man finds a mysterious box. Making sure no one is at home, he opens the box and finds a scroll with a magic incantation inside. He chants the magic spell - and immediately a cute female elf appears. She says she can create any girl the hero wants. But once the girl is created, he has to figure out how to win her good graces...</p>\n<p><em>Custom Mate</em> can be called a \"seduction simulator\". Lacking the adventure elements of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/3500/cocktail/\"> Cocktail's</a> most famous series, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Can+Can+Bunny\"> Can Can Bunny</a>, <em>Custom Mate</em> offers much deeper simulation gameplay instead. In the beginning of the game, the player effectively \"creates\" the girl he will need to seduce; it is possible to choose age, height, breast size, hair style, and personality. Mixing all these parameters results in different girls who require different approach. For example, an older, experienced and direct woman might appreciate physical stimulation (kissing etc.), while a young shy girl needs to talk more before the hero can afford any straight-forward actions. </p>\n<p>The gameplay is menu-driven - the player can choose to talk, to ask, to look, to touch, to kiss, and to take off the girl's clothes. Choosing one of these actions usually leads to a sub-menu, which varies depending on the girl and the current situation. For example, the \"talk\" menu usually brings a large sub-menu of more precise actions (\"praise\", \"order\", \"beg\", etc.), each of which opens new sub-menus. Similarly, physical interaction can also become quite detailed: the \"kiss\" command opens a sub-menu (\"lick\", \"bite\", etc.). Physical interaction is made more precise by implementing a point-and-click interface; in many cases, choosing the exact body part to interact with can be a matter of \"life and death\", since it is possible to make a girl very angry, which might lead to a Game Over.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Angie and Ruby are two ordinary young girls: they like spending time together, talking about fashion, men, and all the usual stuff. But one day, they see a very strange man - dressed in a rabbit costume, with a gigantic erected penis... The two girls try to flee, but instead end up in an alternate dimension - a bizarre world called Decadence Land. This world is populated by grotesque characters with only sex in mind. Now Angie and Ruby have to figure out a way to escape from this dangerous world and to return home...</p>\n<p><em>Daraku no Kuni no Angie</em> is an adventure/RPG hybrid. Movement on the top-down map of Decadence Land is done by clicking on a location icon. The plot is advanced when the player chooses a correct action, unlocking new locations. However, some actions can only be performed when certain items are acquired. Both girls have RPG-like statistics, including a health bar and a \"perversity level\", which corresponds to normal levels in traditional RPGs. There are also more precise statistics which refer to particular sexual parameters and activities (such as \"anal level\", \"vagina stamina\", etc.). When the girls are moving on the world map, random encounters with the weird inhabitants of Decadence Land can occur. Agreeing to participate in sexual activities with these inhabitants decreases the girls' HP, but grants them experience points that raises their \"perversity level\", and with it increases other parameters, that will allow the girls to participate in more dangerous sexual exercises without dying.</p>",

No side was able to control the island for a long time; after a while, the war raged anew, and the island fell under the control of the other side.</p>\n<p>Forty years ago, the Light, represented by human being, prevailed in the latest battle. The island was occupied by humans. One day, a strange-looking man appeared on it. He had no memory of his own past, except his name, Dulldeek, and the hatred to humans. Without knowing what this hatred was caused by, Dulldeek feels the rage of the Dark inside him. He decides to infiltrate the castle of Veevik, the humans' fortress, to satisfy his burning anger...</p>\n<p><em>D'ark</em> is a very simple solo first-person dungeon crawler. As Dulldeek, the player navigates maze-like pseudo-3D dungeons (with auto-mapping), encountering randomly appearing enemies and fighting them in turn-based combat to gain experience points and level up. The magic system is very basic, the sole choice being \"attack spell\" or \"healing spell\", both of which consume magic points. A somewhat unusual feature is the option to turn off random encounters completely at any time.</p>",

It is now possible to cast defensive support magic. The animations in combat are improved, and there are more different textures in the dungeons. As in the first game, there is the possibility to turn random encounters off; in this game, there is an additional \"MAX\" option, which cranks the encounter rate up.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The game is set in an alternate version of the Earth. The time period is not specified, and the abundance of fictional elements make it impossible to identify; but the state of technology clearly predates modern times. Demons have began invading the Earth, coming from the East and already engulfing half of Asia. Europe is actively fighting the demonic hordes; but during the last battles, its strongest heroes were slain. The new generation is represented by the son of the great hero Winzark (created and named by the player). He teams up with Claire, the daughter of Jurgen, another great hero, and offers his services to the king of a fictional country Endeliassen. The king sends the hero and his companions on a quest for Demon's Eye, a powerful artifact that alone can stop the demonic invasion.</p>\n<p>The game plays like a very old-school Japanese RPG, particularly similar to early <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dragon+Quest\"> Dragon Quest</a> games: simple top-down graphics, world map navigation, random first-person-view battles, basic character-building system, and even the necessity to enter menu commands for different actions (such as \"search\" for opening chests or doors). A somewhat unusual feature is the possibility to create the protagonist of the game, choosing his portrait, some of his interests, and allocating initial points to increase his parameters.</p>",

Naturally, this mundane task is just the beginning of great adventures that await these young people...</p>\n<p><em>Iraisha wa Monster?</em> is the first part of the episodic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Disc+Saga\"> Disc Saga</a>, which covers the first part of the heroes' adventure (up to approximately level 10 in character growth). It is a traditional Japanese RPG, particularly influenced by early <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Final+Fantasy\"> Final Fantasy</a> games - a full party of four characters with sharply defined classes (fighter, magic user, etc.) right at the beginning of the game, top-down battles with \"heroes to the right, enemies to the left\" position, etc. Unlike most Japanese RPGs of the time, there are no random encounters: the enemies are visibly roaming the world, and sometimes can gang up on the party for a series of non-stop battles; it is possible to avoid battles by walking past or running away from enemies. The game has distinct humorous undertones in graphics and animation.</p>",

It continues the adventures of the same four youths; they begin the game at character level 10. The heroes find themselves enjoying a vacation on a beach; but naturally, their desire for adventure can't just go away, so instead of relaxing under the sun, they begin to explore the treacherous palace of the mermaids, hoping to find rare treasure.</p>\n<p>Graphically and gameplay-wise, the game is nearly identical to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=disc+saga+iraisha\"> first episode</a>, being a traditional Japanese RPG with top-down navigation and combat, and visible on-screen enemies; the slight differences include new attack animations, new abilities (since the heroes are at a higher level), and the possibility to view each character's parameters (this option was strangely absent from the first episode).</p>",

They begin the game at character level 30. This time, the adventurers end up in a mysterious town where young women fall asleep and don't wake up.

The four heroes belong to four different character classes - warrior, archer, priest, and wizard; the two last ones can cast healing and attack spells, respectively. As in the other <em>Disc Saga</em> episodes, enemies are visible on screen. There is no world map, since most of the action takes place in the girls' dreams, which are built like dungeons populated by enemies and sometimes containing puzzles to solve - such as manipulating switches in order to unlock a series of doors.</p>",

Most of the game takes place in first-person maze-like dungeons. Enemies appear randomly. It is possible to set the party on auto, assign general strategies (\"don't use magic\", etc.), or control every party member individually. The party can visit the town to buy items and rest. </p>\n<p>Typically for the series, <em>Dragon Master Silk II</em> features \"super-deformed\" graphics, humorous dialogues and situations. There are plenty of scantily dressed young girls and sexual innuendo in the game, but no explicit nudity or sex scenes.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The game is based on the unfinished manga <em>Dragon Pink</em> by ITOYOKO, which is an erotic parody on cliche fantasy computer RPG stories. It describes the adventures of a young man named Santa, his cute cat-girl slave Pink and their companions: the slow-witted, but powerful Bobo, and he enigmatic female elf Pierce. The story of the game doesn't follow the exact plot of the manga, but rather depicts some of their typical adventures: monsters roam the wilderness, robbers attack unsuspecting travelers, so the heroes decide to venture to the capital city and offer their services to the rulers. </p>\n<p>Somewhat ironically (since the original manga was created to make fun of computer RPGs), the game is a very traditional Japanese-style RPG with a basic system: the party of four heroes roaming the top-down world map, visiting towns and dungeons, buying equipment, and fighting randomly appearing enemies in first-person-perspective turn-based combat.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The setting of <em>Dragon S\u014dseiki</em> (\"Dragon Genesis\") is based on true historical evidence of a pre-Inca civilization in South America, today's Bolivia, known as <em>Tiawanako</em> or <em>Tiwanaku</em>, stretching in time as far as 1500 BC. The game incorporates some historical and mythological information about the Tiawanako culture; however, most of the other elements for the setting, the characters, and the plot are pure fantasy. The game follows the adventures of a young orphan named Guy Pendragon, who explores the Great Underground Empire of Tiawanako with his old mentor Topa. The mayor of one of the towns asks Guy to bring him some healing water from a magical fountain - which is, naturally, just the beginning of a larger story, during which Guy and his companions will uncover the secrets of the ancient civilization.</p>\n<p>The game is a RPG with predominantly Japanese elements (manga/anime aesthetics, plot-related party members, linear quest nature, etc.); however, the exploration is done entirely in first-person pseudo-3D environments, including towns, like in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Bard's+Tale\"> Bard's Tale</a> series. The enemies appear randomly; there is no separate combat screen, but the battles are still menu-based, not allowing any movement. The player-controlled characters are visible on the screen in \"over-the-shoulder\" view, and their attacks are animated. The game is over when any of the characters' HP reaches zero.</p>",

On his journey Smash hooks up with the lovely messenger of the Fox Tribe, the female guitarist Kiri, and other companions who will help him defeat the evil.</p>\n<p>Despite the third number in its title, which it shares with the episodic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Disc+Saga\"> Disc Saga</a> games (created by the same <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/3206/compile/\"> company</a>), it has little to with them plot- or gameplay-wise. It is closer to traditional Japanese RPGs of the time, having characters with developed personalities, a lot of dialogue, etc. The player navigates Smash and his friends through top-down locations, talking to people and fighting randomly appearing enemies in hostile areas. The turn-based battles are viewed from a side perspective. Characters can execute various \"techniques\", which deplete TP (technique points), or magic spells.</p>",

All the girls start in the same location and have the same gameplay: exploring the top-down environments and fighting any enemies (angels, humans, robots) who dare to oppose El Black. The enemies appear randomly. even though the characters move on the battle screen when attacking, the player has no control over their movement and is only able to issue menu-based commands.</p>\n<p>Both the playable characters and female enemies gradually undress when hit during combat; defeated enemies are completely naked.</p>",

The situation in the city is not a very peaceful one: corrupted officials, thugs roaming the streets, nobility who won't listen to the pleas of simple people. Guy and his two initial companions, Quinn and Goran, must first find more people to join their party. But as more adventurers join, the city is overrun by monsters, and Guy realizes it's not about finding job any more - it's about protecting the entire country.</p>\n<p>Even though it was made by a Japanese company, <em>Early Kingdom</em> is more similar to Western RPGs, being more exploration-oriented rather than focusing on characters and their personal stories. Graphically, it discards the traditional Japanese manga/anime aesthetics in favor of realistic character portraits. The entire game is played from top-down perspective. Combat is real-time, utilizing the characteristic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/14603/kure-software-koubou/\"> Kure Software</a> engine with large parties of both playable characters and enemies, allowing massive battle scenes. The player can control only one character at a time, while the others fight on their own. Attacks are executed simply by bumping into enemies. The characters get experience points and level up from defeating monsters. There is no world map in the game, but a continuous world of wilderness areas and towns.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A young high-school student named Seirou has a normal, boring life: days resemble each other, and so do the nights: every night he sees the same strange dream: two girls talking to each other, one of them saying something about a coming darkness... One day, he and his female classmates find a mirror in an abandoned house; when they touch the mirror, they are transported into the magical medieval land of Ekudorado. The hero must first find his classmates, who are scattered around this world, and then find a way to return to our reality...</p>\n<p><em>Ekudorado</em> is a mixture of card-based strategy and role-playing. The interaction in \"friendly\" areas (towns etc.) is done in Japanese adventure fashion; however, in order to access them, the player has to move the hero on a linear path composed of dots; each dot represents an enemy encounter. The battles follow a rather complex set of card game rules. At each turn, the player is dealt a deck of five cards. There are three kinds of cards: Law, Neutral, and Chaos, and six categories: Black, White, Fire, Earth, Water, and Wind. Each card stands for a unique type of action; for example, a Light Law card restores HP, a Fire Neutral card attacks the enemy with fire, etc. It is also possible to use combination of cards (up to three at a time), which leads to various results (for example, paralyzing the enemy while healing the hero). Even though other characters join the hero, it is possible to use only one character with one deck of cards per battle. </p>\n<p>The RPG angle is present in character-building system: the hero gains experience points and levels up. Each time the player is given a certain amount of points to increase the hero's strength in the six elemental categories (Black, White, etc.).</p>\n<p>The game has scenes with nudity and explicit sexual content.</p>",

But endless wars between different races - humans, dwarves, minotaurs - have driven the peace-loving elves out. They sailed far away, to a remote land, where they decided to settle down. But alas, even in this new place they couldn't find peace! Vicious goblins began to attack the small elvish settlement. The king sends a young elf named Arayle to the goblins' lair. But this is just the beginning of Arayle's grand journey, during which he will meet companions from other races to face together the ultimate evil...</p>\n<p><em>Elves</em> is a Japanese RPG with top-down world map navigation and random combat. The battles take place on a separate isometric screen. It is possible to position the controllable characters (a party of up to five) in different places on the field. Enemies also stand in rows; it is not uncommon to meet a dozen or more enemies in combat. Weapons and magic have their range, so sometimes it is necessary to position characters properly to get the maximum out of their abilities.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>E.S.P.</em> is a side-scrolling shooter. There is no plot in the game - the player controls a robot-like flying device, shooting his way through hordes of organic and mechanical enemies. The player-controlled device can be moved in four directions, and also adjust the angle of fire. There is only one kind of power-up in the game (a floating letter P); eating it will expand the range of the device's fire and also grant it an additional weapon (shooting blue spheres); the player can then adjust the fire angle in such a way that the device can shoot in different directions with different weapons.</p>\n<p>Each stage features two or three mini-bosses and a final boss. Fighting the bosses usually requires memorizing their fire patterns, avoiding their attacks and firing when there is an opening. There is no health bar in the game; the player is sent back to the beginning of the stage whenever his device touches an enemy or is hit by enemy fire. There are unlimited continues.</p>\n<p>Instead of cut-scenes, usually advancing the plot in this type of games, the player is shown a completely unrelated erotic picture of a young girl after the end of each level.</p>",

The Gate of Darkness was securely sealed, with the Guardian protecting the five magical orbs that held the power to shut the Gate.

Yuu, the sole god and ruler of Estoria, calls his faithful warrior Achard to find a way to seal the Gate of Darkness again, and to restore peace in Estoria.</p>\n<p><em>Estoria</em> is a RPG played entirely from top-down perspective. The player navigates Achard and his companions over the world map, visiting towns and entering dungeons on the way. Enemies appear randomly. Playable characters and enemies move on the battle screen, but the player can't control their movement manually. The player assigns commands to the characters (such as attack, use healing magic when low on HP, etc.), after which the battle evolves automatically. In this RPG, characters level up by repeatedly performing certain actions. For example, fighting with a sword will gradually increase the damage the character inflicts with this type of weapon; casting a lot of magic will increase its power, etc.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Out of Chaos, Earth and Heaven were born. The spirits were the first sentient race to appear in the Heaven, and the humans were created afterwards. The two races co-existed in peace, that was only threatened by the race of demons from the Earth. In order to defeat the demons, the humans descended onto the Earth, and stayed there after their victory, building cities and forming nations. </p>\n<p>Years have passed, and the world is threatened once again, this time by the advent of the Demon King. Humans have to unite against the common enemy. But years of existence as separate nations did little to strengthen their bonds. The powerful kingdom of Ilion was the first to take action in uniting the humans. Aided by the goddess Athena, the female general Ayla and her army begin a journey to seek the help of other nations and to defeat the demons.</p>\n<p>The third entry in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=First+Queen\"> First Queen</a> series retains the gameplay formula from the previous games, but emphasizes fantasy elements, anime/manga aesthetics, and more detailed characterization of the main heroes, typical of traditional Japanese RPGs. The strategic angle of commanding large armies is unchanged, as is the <em>gocha-kyara</em> (\"mixed-up characters\") battle system, featuring large-scale fights with dozens of friendly and enemy characters. Instead of the menu-based location selection of the previous games, the main character can actually walk on a world map with icons representing locations.</p>",

Blaming himself for not being able to stop it, Klaus joins a group of mercenaries. Traveling together with his friends Bayse and Miria, Klaus encounters Stella, the princess of Valnausha. After the princess gets kidnapped, Klaus swears that he'll do everything he can to bring her back...</p>\n<p><em>Foreigner</em> is a RPG with a navigation system and interaction reminiscent of Japanese adventures. Menu-based commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", etc.) are present at every screen, and the game lacks physical movement: even in hostile areas (dungeons), the player moves around by selecting screens on a mini-map, which takes him to the next picture. The RPG angle is traditional Japanese style, minus the physical navigation; when Klaus and his party are attacked, a combat screen with battle commands (\"Attack, \"Magic\", etc.) appears. It is possible to buy items and weapons, and the heroes gain experience points and level up in a standard RPG fashion.</p>\n<p>There is sexual innuendo and mild nudity in the game, but no explicit sex.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The game is based on the anime <em>Science Ninja Team Gatchaman</em> (also known under differently translated titles <em>Battle of the Planets</em> and <em>G-Force</em>). Set in the future, it describes the adventures of a team of five young superheroes under the command of Dr. Nambu, the head of the International Science Organization, whose goal is to fight evil aliens known as the Galactor. Led by the mysterious Berg Kattse and aided by a robotic construct known as the Turtle King, the Galactor are trying to steal uranium in order to create more machines and conquer the world. The Ninja Team is lead by Ken Washio and includes three other boys and one girl.</p>\n<p>The game is mainly a Japanese-style adventure with simple turn-based battles with isometric perspective thrown in. There is no RPG system or character growth of any kind. All the battles are pre-set and dictated by the plot. There is no movement on the battle screen. Typically, the party of five heroes must fight several waves of enemies. The heroes have different parameters, but use the same techniques. Special attacks require Special Points (SP), which are gradually restored as the battle progresses. In the beginning of any battle, the player has to choose one of the characters and can only control him/her; it is possible to switch to another character only if the first one dies. There are also battles in vehicles, unique for each character; however, they follow the exact same pattern. Most of the game is spent repeatedly clicking on the characters' portraits in different order to advance the dialogue. There are some \"Yes/No\" decisions, but in many cases the game will only \"agree\" with whatever decision advances the plot. During a few segments, it is also possible to interact with the environment through a typical Japanese command menu (\"Look\", \"Move\", etc.).</p>",

Most of the sex scenes feature short loop-like animation. The stories are entirely linear, but some scenes offer interactivity in form of a point-and-click interface, with the cursor automatically turning into the only available action on the only available spot. This interaction is used only to deplete the available actions and advance the plot.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Akira Ichijou is an ordinary Japanese high-school student. One fine Sunday, he goes out to meet his lovely girlfriend Kanami. Suddenly they see a strange glowing ball. When they touch it, they enter a portal that leads to a parallel dimension named Grounseed. It is a medieval world with spirits and magic. Naturally, it was no coincidence that Akira ended up there: the balance of both worlds is in danger, and only a person from our dimension can restore it. To do that, Akira has to travel to the spirit kings of the five elements, and complete a magical ritual that would prevent both universes from collapsing.</p>\n<p><em>Grounseed</em> could be called a \"minimalist Japanese RPG\", since many typical elements of the genre are omitted: there are no usable items, no money, no equipment, no world map navigation, no random enemies, and even no levels: the characters become stronger immediately after having defeated an enemy (increased strength, HP, etc.). Enemies can be seen wandering on the screen, and usually there aren't many of them around. Akira and his two companions can attack physically or utilize techniques, which deplete technique points (TP). One of the characters also has healing magic spells. To counter the lack of \"hardcore\" Japanese RPG gameplay, the game has extended cut scenes and long conversations between the characters..</p>",

Every four years, a fighting tournament is held by the company that built the computer. The rules of the tournament are strange: female fighters who lose agree to perform services of sexual nature. The Time and Space Investigation office decides to find out what really happens there, and sends a young employee named Hayate to participate in the tournament...</p>\n<p><em>Jik\u016b S\u014dsakan: Hayate</em> is a one-on-one fighting game. There is an exercise mode, but it only allows to fight one opponent on an easier difficulty level. In the \"normal mode\", the difficulty is higher, and all the fights are dictated by the story; it's impossible to choose player-controlled fighters, opponents, scenario, etc. Every battle has just one round. The fighters can use various punches and kicks, jump, and execute powerful special attacks, which deplete their \"spirit bars\". Scenes with nudity appear between the fights.</p>",

In the first game, all the fights were dictated by the story, and the obligatory player-controlled character was Hayate himself. In <em>Hayate: The Battle</em>, the player can choose any of the characters from the previous game, male and female. The battle mode allows the player to choose the opponent as well; it also has a two-player mode. The tournament mode allows the player to choose the playable character, but not the opponents. The game introduces the opponents by itself, increasing the difficulty as the battles progress. After the player has won a battle, a scene with nudity and sexual content is displayed (those scenes do not have a connection with the story). There are adjustable difficulty levels as well.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The country ruled by the king MacIntyre is attacked by king Macaulay and his underlings. The land is burning, and the castle is under attack. The guards convince the young prince Richard to escape. But as he steps out of the castle, he encounters a mysterious dryad named Beatrix. The dryad tells him that there is one way to save the kingdom. A powerful ring can turn all the monster statues in the castle to real monsters. But to be able to do that, Richard must be cursed. The young prince doesn't hesitate. Very soon, he leads the army of monsters into battle, unaware of the price he will have to pay for that...</p>\n<p><em>Hi\u014dden</em> is a strategy game with RPG elements. The player navigates several teams of characters, mostly monsters (up to six in each team) through isometric environments. Sometimes cooperation between different player-controlled teams is required to advance. The game plays in real time, i.e. enemy parties also move and perform actions without waiting for player's input. The RPG angle is present in form of character levels - characters grow stronger after defeating enemies. It is possible to put the teams on \"auto-mode\", having some of them move and perform actions on their own.</p>\n<p>The game has a mouse-driven interface with a somewhat unusual feature for its time: windows. The movement field of different teams, character statistics, overview map, team management screen - everything has its own window. It is possible to enlarge any window to full screen, close it, open several small windows at the same time, and drag windows to arrange them on the screen in any way.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the beginning of 21th century, technology has evolved in unprecedented ways. But so did crime. Huge corporations, which were in fact criminal organizations, came to control the world. Finally, a mega-corporation known as Connection has taken the power in its hands. Everything was sponsored with its money; the governments and the law were silent. Only vigilante groups called \"Connection-Killers\" still tried to resist. In 2015, in Detroit, one of those people, nicknamed DD, witnessed the death of his comrades...</p>\n<p>A year has passed. DD moves to Brain City - a highly developed, modern city, the center of scientific research. It was built on an island in the Atlantic Ocean, which appeared after a volcano eruption. It is controlled by Connection. DD opens an investigation office in the city, trying to get to the heart of Connection and defeat his old nemesis, despite the hostile atmosphere and the grave dangers that await him there...</p>\n<p><em>His Name is Diamond</em> is a RPG with top-down navigation and first-person turn-based combat. The player controls DD as he moves through the urban environments of the game. The enemies appear randomly and are mostly grotesquely exaggerated everyday people (workers, journalists, etc.), with a large amount of sexy women. DD deals with the enemies through various menu commands. Instead of a simple \"attack\" option, there are various techniques and extensive item usage, so that many of the fights feel almost like mini-puzzles. DD gains experience and levels up, increasing his parameters, after defeating enemies.</p>\n<p>The game has scenes with explicit sexual content.</p>",

One day he is resting after having had sex with a girl, and is mysteriously transported into a strange temple. Without knowing what this temple is, and only presuming it must be built by the Aztecs of Yucatan, the hero must find a way out of it, and back home.</p>\n<p><em>Ikenie: Ky\u014draku no Shinden</em> is an adventure game. Unlike most Japanese adventures, there is real movement in the game. The entire game takes place in the temple. The hero moves through the maze-like corridors of the huge temple, viewed from first-person perspective, in dungeon crawler style (with auto-map). However, there is no combat or hero statistics of any kind. The goal of the game is to find rooms with beautiful women in them, and select the correct dialogue choices in order to satisfy them sexually - which will make them open doors for the hero, allowing access to other areas of the temple. The sexual encounters are interactive, utilizing a point-and-click interface with selectable cursors for looking, touching, using tongue, and even a special cursor shaped like a penis, whose function is... not very difficult to deduce.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The character used to spell the title of this game means <em>destruction</em>. Indeed, destruction is part of young Vossgen's life. His father was a brave knight, but he couldn't protect his wife and his child, who was taken to the demonic world of Weltschmerz, raised as a demon, and finally turned into a demon himself. On a quest to find his lost family and the traitor who had caused their separation, Vossgen gets killed. But even as a spirit in the world of the dead, he continues to fight, and finally is resurrected. It's time to visit the big world, to find friends, and to fulfill the wish of his deceased father...</p>\n<p><em>Ki</em> is a Japanese-style top-down RPG with turn-based combat. There are no visible enemies, and the battles are random most of the time, even though encounter rate is low, and in some points the enemy appearance is pre-set. The game follows the traditional procedures of visiting towns to buy equipment (magic spells are also bought in shops), and completing dungeon areas to advance the story. Different characters will join Vossgen on his quest (up to three companions at a time). The battle commands are more complex than usually in Japanese RPGs, having three types of attack - close, normal, and far; close attacks deal more damage, but expose the character more, etc. This applies to physical attacks, magical spells (elemental disciplines), as well as special technique. There are also a few instances when the player is able to make moral choices, which will change Vossgen's karma, and possibly influence the ending.</p>",

The only available interaction is the possibility to see the events through the eyes of five different characters. The player can switch to another character after each short scene. It is therefore impossible to see all the scenes during one play-through. The events of the game unfold regardless of the player's decision to switch characters, and the player is offered no other choices.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The game is based on the anime series known in English as <em>K.O. Beast</em>. In the future, the Earth is split in two halves. Humans control the Southern hemisphere, while the Northern one is inhabited by various half-human, half-beast tribes. The humans want to conquer the lands of the half-beasts and to possess their sacred statues called <em>jinn</em>. The game begins when the three main heroes, the half-beasts Wan Dabadatta (\"Derbard\" in English anime translation), Bud Mint, and the mermaid Mei Mer have already met each other. They found themselves in the Saihate tower, when the two human warriors V-Darn and V-Sion, accompanied by the imp Akumako, attack the tower and try to capture the heroes, who must now escape and eventually stop the humans' evil plans for world domination.</p>\n<p><em>KO Seiki Beast Sanj\u016bshi: Gaia no Fukkatsu</em> can be described as a \"light\" Japanese RPG. There are no weapons or armor the heroes can equip, very few \"friendly\" areas, and almost no NPC interaction; the game mostly consists of long crawls through maze-like top-down locations. Randomly appearing enemies are fought in turn-based combat on an isometric battle screen. The heroes (up to four in a party) can use magical attacks, and later also gain access to magic spells and \"beast transformation\" abilities. Instead of shops that sell items, there are machines for the same purposes found inside the dungeon-like areas.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Kotetsu no Daib\u014dken</em> is based on the anime <em>The Adventures of Kotetsu</em>. The titular heroine (real name Lynn Suzuki, nicknamed <em>Kotetsu</em>, which means <em>Little Iron</em>) is a young apprentice of martial arts who flees her cruel master and is accepted by the kind lady Miho Kuon, who runs a detective agency in Tokyo. The game can be perceived as a sequel to the anime, since it begins roughly where the original story ended, with the former \"nerdy\" spy Tatsuya Mikado already turned good and living by Miho Kuon along with Kotetsu and other heroes. Like the original anime, the game mixes modern setting with bizarre and supernatural elements. Unlike the anime, this game contains many explicit sexual scenes.</p>\n<p>The player-controlled character is for the most part Tatsuya Mikado. The gameplay consists of selecting menu-based commands. The interaction is minimal, and exploration (through menu commands as well) is possible only at a few points in the game. Most of the times, the player is presented with a menu screen containing two or more choices. Making a choice slightly alters the course of the story (mostly regarding the sex scenes). There are also a few turn-based battles in the game, which work a bit like rock-paper-scissors game: it is possible to attack, to raise the attack power of the next turn, or to defend. Correctly guessing the opponent's move is the key to victory.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Last Guardian: J\u016bky\u014d no Shugosha</em> is set in a fantasy world ruled by gods and inhabited by many different races. Many years ago, two of the gods fought each other, until the god Gaduros emerged victorious, imposing a harsh rule over the nation of the winged Beasts. But the beautiful goddess Typhon defeated Gaduros. It looked like the age of peace finally began. But when the Beasts discovered an ancient disc-like artifact, everything went wrong again. A warrior from the nation of Centaurs and a mysterious religious cult suddenly became very interested in the artifact, making it clear to the Beasts that they will have to fight for their lives. And so three of them - two young friends, Rezak and Maxen, and their older comrade Badio - started a dangerous journey across the world, to find out what their enemies' intentions truly are...</p>\n<p>The game is a mixture of RPG and strategy. As in most RPGs, the player controls a party of characters (up to 7), who gain experience points from fighting enemies and level up. However, there is no exploration of any kind and no movement outside of the battle field in the game. The game consists of long strategic battles and cut scenes, most of which are presented as still anime-style shots that advance the story. The turn-based battles allow free movement on the battle field. Each action (movement, physical attack, spell, etc.) requires a certain amount of action points. Beside the usual attacks, some player-controlled characters can transform into various types of beasts. While in \"beast mode\", the character gains access to new abilities, but might lose some of those he/she had while in human-like form.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Last Guardian 2: Yomi no F\u016bin</em> is a direct sequel to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=last+guardian+shugosha\"> first game</a> in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=last+guardian\"> Last Guardian</a> series. It continues the unfinished story of the first game - the adventures of a group of heroes from the Beast nation. The sequel focuses on two of the previous game's main characters, Badio and his sweetheart Miriana. Traveling by ship, the couple arrives in a small city in the Eastern continent, where they meet a dying warrior from the Dragon tribe, who is holding a child in his arms, begging the heroes to bring him safely to his people. But Badio and his friends know it won't be easy, when they are attacked by a group of Beast Hunters, and when the powerful enemies continue plotting their schemes against the heroes...</p>\n<p>The gameplay is very similar to that of the first game, with a few minor changes. As before, there is no exploration or movement outside the battles; the entire game consists of long strategic fights and cut scenes. Once again, the player has access to beast transformation for the characters in the party. The player-controlled characters level up automatically, but this time can level up in the middle of the battle. The \"Defend\" command is now available, requiring 1 action point. Some changes were made to the interface (different icons, design of the menus, etc.), but otherwise, nothing essential has been changed compared to the previous game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Chilam Balam</em> is a collection of Mayan books, containing scientific information as well as prophecies and esoteric lore. The story of the game eventually reveals a connection to these mysterious books, but it begins in a more prosaic way. Set in the American Wild West (with fictional locations), it follows the story of Wilfred R. Anderson, or simply Fred. His father left him a gift, a seemingly ordinary gun. But one day, Fred's sweetheart Christina is kidnapped; the ransom note proposes a meeting in a saloon in another town, and demands that gun in exchange for Christina's freedom. Fred and his friend Max and Edward head to the other town - and that is just the beginning of a very long journey, that will force the young men to face grave dangers and unspeakable supernatural forces.</p>\n<p>The stand-out feature of <em>Libros de Chilam Balam</em> is its unusual Wild West setting. In other aspects, the game plays like a typical Japanese RPG, particularly similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Phantasy+Star\"> Phantasy Star</a> series (the battles with abstract backgrounds and over-the-head view of the characters remind of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7748/phantasy-star-ii/\"> Phantasy Star II</a>). Characters can equip guns, but the way weapons are handled is no different from a standard Japanese RPG. The heroes roam the top-down world and fight random monsters in turn-based combat; there are even magic spells of various kinds - healing, supporting, and offensive. As in most Japanese RPGs, leveling up is automatic.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A long time ago, humans possessed unique power, that allowed them to create wonderful things and to build a highly advanced civilization. But it all ended when the chariots of the terrifying Death God attacked and destroyed the beautiful cities beyond the skies. Humans have lost their memories. And the magical powers from before started serving evil intentions...</p>\n<p>Although a Japanese game, <em>Lunatic Dawn</em> is much more similar to \"old-school\" Western RPGs than to its compatriots. For once, it is not a story-driven game. There are almost no scripted events, very few dialogues, etc. The overall theme of the game is quite abstract: the cities serve as places to buy equipment and learn combat techniques, but have no real locations (everything is accessed via a menu). </p>\n<p>The game is dedicated to character creation, RPG-style character development, and exploration. In the beginning, the player creates the playable character, choosing age, gender, and even weaknesses - all of which affect the character's parameters such as stamina, weapon technique, charisma, etc. Afterwards, the player allocates points into the remaining parameters. The player starts in a city and is absolutely free to go wherever he/she wants. There is a day/night cycle in the game. It is necessary to keep an eye on the character's stamina and buy food rations - the character can die of exhaustion and hunger. Random enemies appear on the world map and in dungeons. Battle screen is isometric and allows free movement. It is not necessary to choose a command for each turn: the battles evolve automatically until the player interrupts them with a new command.</p>",

But one day, a demon named Nakachimaro and his minions invaded the village, kidnapped the villagers' pigs, and destroyed their fields and gardens! The young Darios swears that he will find the bad guys and make them pay! He and his best friend, the elf girl Eru, venture into the nearby cave, pursuing Nakachimaro. Little they know that this will be just the beginning of a long and perilous journey! </p>\n<p><em>Gensei F\u016bky\u014d Den</em> is a Japanese RPG with a somewhat \"light\" approach, both in story-telling and gameplay. The gameplay mostly follows the standard procedure of Japanese-style RPGs, although some features are simplified: there is no \"world map\", and town navigation is menu-based. Most of the gameplay consists of navigating maze-like top-down dungeons, fighting random enemies in turn-based first-person perspective combat. Characters use special points (SP) for powerful attacks and magic points (MP) for spells.</p>",

Important characters from <em>Gensei Kitan</em> (including its protagonist, the dog Smash) appear in the game, and some of them are playable. However, the main hero is a young and very ambitious thief named Ali-Baba - who is, naturally, the leader of a band of 40 robbers. The game is divided into chapters; each one describes an episode from Ali-Baba's \"career\", from train robbery to treasure hunt and even discovery of the magic lamp .</p>\n<p>The game is a humorous \"light\" Japanese-style RPG - there is no world map, and most of the time the hero is taken to a new location automatically. Many locations have simple puzzles to solve, and some dungeon areas are maze-like. The gameplay system is nearly identical to that of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=gensei+kitan\">Gensei Kitan</a>, with the same interface and overall structure. Random enemies are fought in turn-based style, on a side-view battle screen. Characters use physical attacks, special techniques, and magical spells. As in all <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Gensei\"> Gensei</a> games, HP, SP, and MP are fully restored by level up.</p>",

        "description": "<p>As in most <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Madou+Monogatari\"> Mad\u014d Monogatari</a> games, the story of <em>Michikusa Ibun</em> is quite simple: once again, the young magician Arle has to venture into a dangerous dungeon as part of her magical education. This time, Arle is a teenager, and has the cute creature Carbuncle (whose side job seems to be an official <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/3206/compile/\"> Compile mascot</a>) accompanying her on her perilous journey.</p>\n<p><em>Michikusa Ibun</em> plays just like any other <em>Mad\u014d Monogatari</em> game: it is a 100% dungeon crawler, with Arle navigating pseudo-3D maze-like locations (with an auto-map feature), fighting random enemies in turn-based style. The game retains all the unique elements of the series, such as the overall \"cute\" style, no physical attacks at all (Arle can only cast magical spells), and no number-based feedback or any statistics. Damage done in battle and Arle's or enemy's condition can be deduced only from animations and text descriptions.</p>",

They are accosted a pair of bandits, who are quickly taken out by Lina's magic. In return for sparing their lives, the bandits tell Lina and Gourry of a secret cave near the city of Welnan where a powerful dragon lives...a powerful dragon whose fangs are worth lots of money! Lina immediately decides that this is their next destination, and off they go to Welnan to prepare. Their plan soon deviates, though, as they find themselves involved in something called the \"Chimera of the Year Contest.\"</p>\n<p><em>Slayers</em> is a dungeon-crawler RPG based on the light novel series of the same name by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/355533/hajime-kanzaka/\">Hajime Kanzaka</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/355536/rui-araizumi/\">Rui Araizumi</a>. The player takes Lina and Gourry, along with a companion of their choosing (including mainstays like Zelgadis, Naga, Amelia, and even Amelia's father Phil), and ventures off into the dungeon near Welnan. The player must explore the dungeon, fighting enemies and looking for treasure. Lina and her companions must also return to the surface in order to visit Welnan, which is the only place where the game can be saved; in the town, thy can also rest and heal, change or revive characters, and buy or sell items.</p>\n<p>During battles, the player only directly controls Lina, with the rest of the team acting on their own. Characters do not level up, having their full range of abilities from the beginning. The focus is on proper use of those abilities, minimizing the need for returning to the surface, and having the right team and items for the task at hand.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The heroine of <em>Mad\u014d Monogatari: ARS</em> is, like in all other games in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Madou+Monogatari\"> Mad\u014d Monogatari series</a>, the young apprentice magician Arle (in this game, she is still a little girl). However, <em>Mad\u014d Monogatari: ARS</em> contains two other stories dedicated to Rurue (Rulue) and She-Zo (Schezo), who are known as antagonists in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=puyo+puyo\"> Puyo-Puyo</a> games, but here act as protagonists. All the three stories can be played directly from the main menu.</p>\n<p>In Arle's story, the little girl is walking through a forest and suddenly sees the cute Carbuncle (<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/3206/compile/\">Compile's</a> mascot). The little guy runs away, and Arle follows him into the depths of the forest, facing dangerous monsters.</p>\n<p>Rurue's story begins when she is taken to a mysterious castle. She has lost her memory and must now find her way out of the castle, which is populated by vicious enemies.</p>\n<p>She-Zo, who is otherwise a powerful magician, is just a school boy in this game. His class is having a tour in the ruins of a 200-year-old dungeon. While the rest of the children follow the guide, the curious boy touches a strange mirror, and is sucked into the dungeon, the way it was once...</p>\n<p>The gameplay is traditional <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Madou+Monogatari\"> Mad\u014d Monogatari</a> style: crawl through pseudo-3D maze-like dungeons, fighting random enemies in turn-based combat. As in other games in the series, there is a distinct \"wacky\" edge to enemy design, and - despite it being an RPG - no numbers at all. All statistics pointing to damage in battle, conditions, etc., are depicted through animations and text comments. </p>\n<p>Arle and She-Zo can only cast magic spells. Being a little girl, Arle starts with only two spells, aptly named \"Hot\" and \"Cold\". She-Zo has a vast array of elemental magic. Rurue uses \"techniques\" instead of magic, but they work pretty much the same way.</p>",

News of this resurrection traveled to the Academy of Heroes. Instructor Nina sent one of the youngest, but most talented students, the purple-haired girl Piroron, to check if the rumor is true. Piroron found the wilderness area of the kingdom infested by monsters. Now the young apprentice has to fight for her life!..</p>\n<p><em>Magic++</em> is a top-down action game. The player navigates Piroron through hostile areas, helping her to defeat the enemies who try to kill her. Enemies utilize ranged as well as melee attacks, but so does Piroron; in various treasure chests she can find weapons, although her basic attack is a ranged energy ball. When defeated, enemies turn into various items: hearts, which replenish Piroron's hit points; bombs, which will damage Piroron if she comes too close; and various collectible items (stars etc.) that serve the following purpose: once Piroron has collected enough items of a certain kind (sometimes in combination with other items), she will gain access to powerful special techniques. The more items Piroron has collected, the more times she can execute the special attack. Piroron can also jump, and this ability is required in many areas.</p>",

She calls the baby Taro, and the statues of the bodhisattva Kannon advise her to seek a spirit named Pusheck. Asako calls upon her own personal spirit, who looks like a modern-day boy and is appropriately named Boy, and the three explore the nearby mountain to find the mysterious Pusheck.</p>\n<p>The game contains typical Japanese RPG elements such as top-down exploration, randomly appearing enemies, simple leveling up system, and turn-based first-person perspective combat. The characters have three point bars: body, soul, and mind. Body is equivalent to HP, soul influences combat performance, and mind is needed to use \"mind powers\", which are the same as magic spells. There are also 64 kinds of upgrades, which can be collected in battles; each one of them raises certain parameters or has an otherwise beneficial effect on the characters.</p>",

Indeed, it is based off of the arcade version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/12034/gradius-iii/\">Gradius III</a>, and uses much of the graphics and music from that title. All of the signature weapons, like the laser, ripple, twin shot, and even the options, are present. Iconic <em>Gradius</em> enemies like the Big Core even show up.</p>\n<p>However, this game was not produced or authorized by Konami; it is the work of an independent doujin fan-game circle known as CO2-PRO. It is also different from the other entries in the series: though much of the artwork and music is lifted from Konami's game, the stages themselves are not. Each of the ten stages in <em>Garudius '95</em> is unique, and has never appeared in any of the official <em>Gradius</em> titles. Designed for the <em>Gradius</em> veteran, the game presents a challenge even on the lowest difficulty setting. The player is allowed to choose from any of the first four stages to start at, and there are five difficulty levels.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In this game, the player is entrusted with supervising and managing the life of a highly advanced android, who looks like a young pretty girl and is commonly called <em>Marion</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Marion</em> is a simulation game. Its main gameplay activity is to make schedules and choose activities for the sexy android. Depending on the player's way of managing Marion's life, she can become a different person, gaining proficiency in different professions and spheres of life.</p>\n<p>When making a schedule, the player has the choice between different activities, sub-divided into three categories: Training, Test, and Maintenance. The last one allows to immediately increase Marion's main parameters: CPU, legs, arms, or body. Training includes combat-related activities: practice shooting, sending Marion to the army, etc., but also other activities such as sports and dancing. Test is more oriented towards professional education, including sending Marion to work in a hospital, clean floors, or even become a call girl for escort service.</p>\n<p>Each one of those activities increases some of Marion's secondary parameters and decreases others. For example, going to the army increases strength and stamina, but decreases beauty level, etc.</p>\n<p>If Marion focuses on a certain activity, the player will be shown random cut scenes, most of which contain nudity and explicit sex.</p>\n<p>The game can be completed in a very short time, but the various endings and the inability to see all the cut scenes during one play-through encourage replaying it in a different way.</p>",

They fought each other, and the Blue Dragon was victories, sealing Red Dragon's spirit. But his injuries were too grave, and he disappeared from our world, entrusting his spirit to a few select humans.</p>\n<p>Many years later, a high-school student named Kamiya Tenma discovers, to his amazement, that his school has been overrun by monsters. The spirit of the Blue Dragon contacts him, telling him that his lady friend Miku holds the key to victory over those who want to resurrect the Red Dragon. Armed with the magic spells given to him by the Blue Dragon, the young man begins to explore the infested school...</p>\n<p><em>Mary\u016b Gakuen: Nerawareta Shitai</em> is a first-person dungeon crawler. The player navigates Tenma through the maze-like pseudo-3D environments (with auto-map), fighting random enemies in turn-based combat. The battles are viewed from a side perspective. Most of the gameplay is dedicated to exploring every corner of the dungeon, finding the items necessary to advance to the next area. The RPG system is very basic, with MP used for various spells (including supporting defensive magic), automatic leveling up, and no equipment. The game contains scenes with nudity and sexual situations.</p>",

However, <em>Kegasareta Nikutai</em> follows the adventures of another hero, also a high-school student, named Takuya. Lately he has been having strange dreams, seeing a glowing face surrounded by warriors. One day, the strange face contacts him, saying that the spirit of an ancient dragon in another world needs Takuya's help, since he is the only one who can find the girl with the powers to save that other dimension. Takuya is then taken to the parallel world, where the civilization is still in the medieval stage, and is aided by two local warriors when he starts his journey.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is similar to that of <em>Nerawareta Shitai</em>: most of the game is spent exploring pseudo-3D maze-like dungeons, fighting random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a side perspective. However, <em>Kegasareta Nikutai</em> adds more \"mainstream\" RPG elements, such as a party of three right from the beginning, a town where the heroes can buy supplies, and the possibility to equip weapons and armor.</p>",

As in the previous game, the story revolves around the war initiated by the race of Fantura against the technologically advanced civilization of Ende. Satan Crowhazer was one of the eight representatives of Fantura who did not support the war. He was betrayed by his powerful compatriots, and saved by a person from the Ende race, who put him into a cryogenic chamber.</p>\n<p>Awakening after 15 years, Satan finds out the terrible truth: using the magical abilities of the Apocrypha race, most of the Fantura have been turned into hideous monsters. Their leaders, who have lost any resemblance to human beings plan to conquer the entire world. Will the last hero of Fantura be able to stop the destruction his own race brings upon itself and others?..</p>\n<p><em>Mercury 2: Tales of the Planet</em> looks and plays almost identically to its predecessor, even though its graphics have a slightly more pronounced anime edge. It utilizes isometric graphics for exploration and combat. As before, enemies appear randomly and have to be defeated in turn-based combat. Leveling up is automatic, as in most Japanese RPGs. Despite its overall sci-fi theme, heroes can use magic spells in the game.</p>",

The city has turned into an international megalopolis, where crime prospers, and where justice is pursued by lone vigilante fighters. The hero of the story is a private detective named Brian. The first case is about an assault on a prostitute in the brothel \"John Wayne\". Further investigation reveals that the assault is connected to other cases, some of which involve dangerous biological experiments. With the help of the policewoman Akane, the bounty hunter Ridley, and others, Brian begins to gradually see the whole picture...</p>\n<p><em>Merry Go Round</em> consists mostly of still graphical images and plenty of text. The interaction is reduced to occasional choice-making. However, most of the choices don't influence the story, but simply lead to additional text description or picture. The game contains nudity and explicit sex scenes.</p>",

But in order to do this, they have to sacrifice a descendant of Oersted, and this happens to be the lovely Oerstedia, queen of Broshan. Before long the queen is kidnapped.

Most of the game time is spent in top-down maze-like dungeons, where the player character fights enemies in action-style combat. Characters gain experience and get stronger. They can also find weapons and armor scattered around the dungeons. </p>\n<p>It is possible to play as either of the four heroes: a lizardman, a human, a female half-elf, and a dwarf. These characters have different parameters, but their gameplay style is similar (melee combat), and they have to go through the same locations and events. </p>\n<p><em>Oerstedia</em> also offers a two-player mode.

        "description": "<p><em>Otome Senki</em> is set in 16th century, during the <em>Sengoku</em> (\"Warring States\") period of Japanese history. The plot of the game is rather simple: an unnamed princess is kidnapped by demons, and the warlord Oda Nobunaga calls the bravest warriors to rescue her. However, all the men are either gravely wounded or unwilling to fight. Nine young maidens join forces and venture into a monster-infested dungeon to rescue the princess.</p>\n<p>The game is a pseudo-3D dungeon crawler. Most of the game is spent exploring the maze-like dungeon (no auto-map feature), solving the simple puzzles (such as pulling switches) and finding the correct way. Enemies appear randomly and are engaged in turn-based combat. Each one of the nine heroines has different combat statistics and abilities: some are oriented towards sword techniques, others focus on support, etc. The player can build a party of four maidens out of the available nine. If the entire party is defeated in the dungeon, the player can assemble a second party and continue the game. </p>\n<p><em>Otome Senki</em> contains scenes with nudity. Some of the enemies in the game are half- or completely naked young women.</p>",

One day, her father tells her about a tradition in their family: each time a princess turns sixteen, the king sends her to a tower, where she will remain locked until she solves all its puzzles and proves herself worthy of her royal title.</p>\n<p><em>Princess Confusion</em> is a puzzle game. It has two modes, Story and Game. In the Story mode, the princess has to complete the puzzle rooms in a specific order, while the Game mode allows the player to choose any of the available 24 levels.</p>\n<p>Each level is a top-down room with a black hole and several balls marked with different letters scattered around. The goal of the game is to sink all the balls marked with the letter N into the hole. The only available action in the game is to push a ball; the princess can do it simply by simply walking near it and keep pressing the direction button.</p>\n<p>Naturally, getting the N balls into the hole involves more than just pushing them; typically, they are inaccessible in their starting position. In order to move them into a spot from which the princess can push them, the player has to manipulate other balls. Balls marked U, D, R, and L (up, down, right, and left) change the gravity center of the level. When pushed into the black hole, they make all other balls roll into the corresponding direction. The princess herself loses the ability to walk in the opposite direction once the corresponding ball has been sunk. Balls marked B explode when the princess pushes them. The objective is to figure out the correct combination and order of moves (sometimes quite complex) to create appropriate conditions for sinking the N balls into the hole.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The town of Jester is located near a spring, which is used both by humans from the town and the beast people from their forest village. For years, the two races co-existed in peace. But one day, somebody sets the Jester tavern on fire. The authorities arrest a young beast girl who happened to be in the town at that time. Outraged by the injustice, a young orphan boy named Kein, who was raised by Tyrone, one of the town knights, convinces him to help the girl escape. But that act draws the ire of the town authorities, and the heroes realize that they have to flee...</p>\n<p><em>Reij\u016b - Twin Road</em> is a mixture of RPG and strategy. Unlike most Japanese turn-based strategy RPGs, there is movement in the game (exploring towns and world map). The though battles are pre-set in usually take a while to complete, with strategic combat that allows free movement on the battle field. Some of the characters can cast offensive and healing spells. Each attack is displayed as a short animated sequence on a separate screen. Each character gains experience immediately after defeating an enemy, and can level up in the middle of the battle.</p>\n<p>The game contains scenes with nudity and mild sexual situations.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Revery</em> are people who know the secret way of magic. Few of those are left in the world, and unfortunately, not all of them use their powers for good...</p>\n<p>Tyfana is a young girl who was living together with her father, Alfred. One day, a mysterious man named Wolfgang came to her father's house, demanding a magical artifact known as the Staff of Freya. Wolfgang cast a spell on Alfred, petrifying him. At the last moment, Alfred ordered Tyfana to grab the staff. Then he created a portal, and Tyfana disappeared...</p>\n<p>The young girl finds herself in an unknown forest, with the staff in her hands. Armed with her newly acquired magical power, she swears to find a way to return home and rescue her father.</p>\n<p><em>Revery: Izanai no Masuish\u014d</em> is a role-playing game with a rather unusual combat system. There are no separate battle screens; the combat takes place on the exploration field and in real time. The player directly controls only Tyfana, but other characters can join the party and fight on her side, controlled by the AI; the player is able to assign general strategies to them (attack, defend, run away, etc.). Since Tyfana is armed with a staff and casts magical spells, the player-controlled combat in the game entirely consists of long-ranged magical attacks that require aiming (the game pauses for that moment). Tyfana needs magic points to cast spells, which (like her HP) are gradually restored when she walks. She can equip rings, bracelets, and necklaces to enhance her defenses.</p>\n<p>A somewhat unusual (for Japanese RPGs) feature of <em>Revery: Izanai no Masuish\u014d</em> is the leveling-up system, which is controlled by the player. Every time Tyfana levels up, the player is given a certain amount of points, which he/she can freely use to raise any of the player character's attributes.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The playable character in this game is a blacksmith called Bargon. As he introduces himself in the beginning of the game, he explains that he enjoys killing people. And that's exactly what the player will have to do while controlling this character. Bargon enters a small village, where he is able to kill anyone, including little children. If the \"attack\" key is pressed when Bargon is near a young woman, he rapes her instead of killing. Most of the people he kills can't defend themselves and are completely powerless while he is slaughtering them. </p>\n<p>Killing (or raping) certain characters triggers events, opening new locations. Eventually, Bargon will have to fight armed warriors and other powerful characters who come to stop him.</p>\n<p>The game uses a single attack key for all the actions; items are collected automatically when Bargon bumps into their containers. It is possible to use healing items as well as teleport to the entrance of a location.</p>",

The goal here is to learn enough about different flowers, the ways to make them grow, and the preferences of the girls. </p>\n<p>The player is given exactly fourteen days of game time to accomplish this task. From the main screen it is possible to access information about flowers, check the weather conditions, talk to the girls (one time with each girl), then decide which flowers to plant. It is then possible to choose again with which girl to talk; sometimes they will ask different questions (about various topics, but mostly concerning flowers), and the answers will also influence their attitude towards the main character. Afterwards, a day of game time will pass. If the player is successful, the satisfied girls will pose naked, and eventually have sex with the hero.</p>",

His father, Garland, was a mighty warrior who was killed ten years ago. Now Aleph has grown up and must follow in his father's footsteps, starting with exterminations of nearby hostile goblins. Naturally, this is just the beginning of a grand quest that will eventually turn into a world-saving mission and restoration of the balance between different races in the world.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is as traditional as the story: a basic Japanese-style party-based RPG with little to no extra features. The heroes roam the top-down world map, fight random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, automatically level up, automatically learn new magic spells that require magic points, visit villages to rest and buy supplies, and descend into dungeons. Later in the game the player will also be able to navigate a ship to access previously locked locations.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The game with such a simple, yet expressive title is also rather simple and to-the-point in its concept: it is about having sex and nothing else. There is no real story in the game: in the beginning, a crazy-looking character named Mr. Funk, who speaks in Japanese with a heavy dose of stereotypical hip-hop lingo, announces that the player is now declared King of Sex and can therefore directly have sex with any of the three \"available\" young and pretty girls: Nana, the cute school girl, Makoto, the \"mature\" woman (probably in her early twenties), and the obligatory underage girl with pink hair, Ai.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is dedicated entirely to sex, and features so many possibilities and precise commands, that <em>Sex</em> can be considered a simulation game. The goal is achieved with ease, since the player character has access to sexual activities right from the beginning. However, in order to see all the graphics, the player has to deplete every possible \"activity tree\", making choices between the player character's precise actions and ultimately changing the \"course of the intercourse\".</p>",

There is no real story in the game; Momojirou visits Ayaka at her flower shop every day and has sex with her. However, events might occur between their sexual encounters, adding an item to the hero's inventory, which can later be used for their mutual pleasure.

        "description": "<p>In 1999, Armageddon came to the world. Japanese researchers have experimented with genetics and biological mutations; as a result, a new race of powerful demons known as <em>shiki-oni</em> emerged, and in a short time has conquered the Earth, obliterating most of human civilization.</p>\n<p>Hayato, the young hero of the game, is a son to a human mother and the Demon Dragon, the most powerful shiki-oni. His ultimate goal is to defeat his own father and save the remnants of the human race.</p>\n<p><em>Shiki Oni no Koku: Ch\u016bgokuhen</em> is an episodic game. There are no differences between the episodes gameplay-wise or graphically; each episode simply continues the story from the point it was left off in the end of the previous episode.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is \"light\" Japanese-style RPG, characteristic for many <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/3206/compile/\"> Compile</a> games: there are no weapons and armor; the magic system is very simple and rudimentary; there are only very few NPCs and friendly areas, and no real towns; most of the game is spent exploring the maze-like top-down dungeons, in which the party of player-controlled characters (up to 4) fights enemies in traditional turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. However, unlike most Japanese RPGs of the time, the enemies are visibly wandering on the screen, and the battle begins when there is a physical contact between them and the player character.</p>\n<p>This is the final episode of the story. The characters start at level 30. They have to find the remaining Heavenly Kings on the Earth. They are taken to the illusion city ruled by the Heavenly Queen of the North. The heroes must face ghosts from the past and eventually fulfill their mission, saving the humanity from the yoke of the demons.</p>",

The largest building of all times was erected in Osaka and named \"Atlas Tower\".</p>\n<p>But the day before the opening ceremony, two mysterious characters appear in front of the tower - a demonic-looking man and woman. The man, who calls himself Tanoma, announces that \"their time has finally come\". It's up to the young amateur detective Naruto to unravel this mystery, and prevent a terrible disaster.</p>\n<p><em>Shinwaden: Hat\u014d no Sh\u014d</em> is an adventure game. True to its Japanese origins, the game has no inventory management, puzzles, dialogue trees, or other elements of a Western adventure. However, unlike most Japanese adventures, <em>Shinwaden: Hat\u014d no Sh\u014d</em> has real physical movement. Most of the game is spent navigating the top-down districts of Osaka, entering buildings, and talking to people, trying to advance the plot. Only a few occasions feature the traditional still \"Look/Talk/Think\" menu. </p>\n<p>There are some scenes with nudity in the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The great womanizing detective Max, whom we met in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=shiritsu+tantei+nazo\"> first Shiritsu Tantei Max game</a> is back! This time, he is taken to a magical parallel dimension, which is populated by elemental spirits. It turns out that the Galactic Orb that was in Max's possession awakened the evil witch Morgan, who had been previously sealed by the elemental rulers. Balance is destroyed, and magical creatures have gone berserk. Together with his companion, the little pixie Viewer, Max has to undo the damage and stop Morgan from taking over the world.</p>\n<p>Unlike the first game, <em>Shiritsu Tantei Max 2: Master of Elemental</em> is an RPG. It plays like a fairly traditional Japanese-style representative of the genre: the player navigates Max over the top-down world, fighting random enemies in turn-based fashion, and visiting towns for rest and supplies. Characters have typical RPG proficiencies (for example, Viewer has low HP and weak attacks, but can cast healing magic, etc.). The characters level up automatically, as per standard Japanese RPG rule.</p>\n<p>The adult content comes in form of over-sexed female demonic enemies, some of which fully undress upon defeat, as well as during Max's dates. In towns, the player can use the special \"Hunt\" command to locate the available girls. Some of them will agree to date Max. Staying at the inn will then trigger an erotic picture with the girl in question.</p>",

But everything goes terribly wrong. A huge demon appears, sending his minions and invading the town. Accidentally, the hero meets several angel-like girls with supernatural powers.

The player commands a party consisting of the hero and the angelic female fighters. The goal is to fight through several stages (marked on the map) in any order, defeating the occupying demonic forces. The characters move on the top-down battle field in round-based fashion, attacking when an opponent is on a nearby field. When attacked, the player has the choice of counter-attack or defense. Attacks are shown as small animated sequences at the bottom of the screen. Defeating enemies result in experience points and money, which can be spent to buy equipment for the player-controlled characters.</p>",

The fabric of reality is torn when demons from the parallel realm known as \"Illusion Village\" invade the human world through the shrine Reimu is guarding. The young girl must defeat the demons and seal the entrance from the other world.</p>\n<p>The first of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/9152/toho-touhou-series/\">T\u014dh\u014d series</a> is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/2126/breakout-variants/\">Breakout-style games</a>, since it is composed of one-screen levels, with the typical goal of destroying all the bricks (cards, in the case of this game) by manipulating a ball. However, unlike in most <em>Breakout</em> clones, the player controls a real character (Reimu) instead of a traditional paddle. The specific gameplay mechanics are also a bit different: the ball cannot fall \"below the ground\"; if it hits Reimu, she loses a life; the player has to press a corresponding key to hit the ball in close range. </p>\n<p>The game can also be considered a shooter, since Reimu can (and often has to) shoot the ball when it is high in the air, to change its trajectory and destroy cards. Also, after every five \"regular\" levels there is a \"boss level\", which plays similarly to top-down shooters, and during which Reimu also has to defend herself from projectiles shot by the boss, either dodging or shooting them.</p>",

        "description": "<p>High in the heavens, there was a girl who was training in a shrine to be the successor of a goddess. One day, the goddess had to leave the shrine to attend a meeting of the many gods, leaving the girl alone at the shrine. The goddess warned her to leave alone a box of star-souls within the shrine, and that under no circumstances should she open it. Naturally, as soon as the goddess had left, the girl's curiosity got the better of her and she opened the box.</p>\n<p>The star-souls escaped, turned the girl into a small fairy, and fled down towards the Earth. She must track down and capture the star-souls, now causing mischief on Earth, before the goddess returns to the shrine. However, while chasing several of the star-souls through the sky, the girl crashes through the window of a young man who lives on Earth. She decides that since he can somehow see her, that he's going to help her out, and so the two of them begin their adventure.</p>\n<p><em>Star Platinum</em> is an erotic visual novel combined with a basic card game. The player reads through the story as it progresses, accompanied by still illustrations of the events as they unfold. Whenever a character in need of exorcising is encountered, the game switches to the battle mode. In the battle mode, the player and the computer take turns matching and collecting cards that feature various astrological symbols. If one collects enough cards of a certain type to create a set, then the player can attack, reducing the opponent's health by a set amount and resetting the cards to their neutral state.</p>\n<p>If the player can deplete the opponent's health, then the story will continue and the player will be rewarded with increasingly erotic images of the opponent (which can be viewed again later through the main menu). However, if the player's health is depleted, then the battle must be started over again from the beginning.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Block Quest V</em> is a <em>Breakout</em> clone with adult content. The player must keep the ball from falling out the bottom of the screen, while at the same time attempting to destroy all the blocks on the screen using the ball. There are no powerups, but there are a wide variety of different block types including blocks that switch on and off and blocks that move. The player can also shake the playfield to adjust the ball's trajectory, much like tilting in a pinball game. If the game continues for long enough, the ball will move faster and faster, but will eventually explode into three separate balls which move slower again.</p>\n<p>There are a total of nine areas with eleven stages each. Each area has a theme (hospital, restaurant, school), and a girl who matches the theme (nurse, waitress, student). As the player clears the stages, the player is rewarded with several pictures of the \"stage girl\" in varying stages of undress.</p>",

The turtle replaces the traditional space ship, but otherwise <em>T\u014dh\u014d: F\u016bmaroku</em> plays very similarly to other so-called <em>bullet hell shooters</em>, with multiple enemies on the screen attacking at once, and ferocious bosses with their unique attack patterns. Reimu's turtle can upgrade its shooting abilities by eating various letters dropped from above. Reimu can also use a limited amount of bombs, which cause massive damage to all the enemies at once.</p>",

Reimu Hakurei, the shrine maiden, wants to explore the ruins; to her astonishment, other young girls with supernatural powers are also interested in the ruins. Rumor has it that the heart of the ruins contains a source of unimaginable power. Reimu must now compete against the other girls in order to be the first to enter the core of the ruins.</p>\n<p>The third entry in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/9152/toho-touhou-series/\">T\u014dh\u014d series</a> is, like the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/45354/toho-fumaroku/\">second</a>, a vertically scrolling shooter. However, <em>T\u014dh\u014d: Yumejik\u016b</em> can only be played as a versus game (split-screen, for two players or one player against computer). Choosing any of the five available playable girls, the player has to compete against another character, going through the same stages; the boss enemy of a stage is the actual other character.</p>\n<p>Like in the previous game, each character has a limited amount of bombs to inflict massive damage on all enemies on screen. A new feature is a special attack, which is unique to each girl, including various powerful attacks such as a laser ray, revolving orbs that destroy enemies on their way, shots sent to different directions, etc.</p>",

When he comes to the castle where they are hidden, the princess entrusts them to a fairy to find help. She escapes the castle and finds three young travelers of improbable hair colors: Rare, Medium, and Well. The fairy entrusts each girl with one of the seals, and they set off to defeat Galuf, rescue the princess, and restore peace to the kingdom.</p>\n<p><em>Totsugeki! Mix</em> is a cute action platform game. Choosing one of the three girls, each with their own unique weapon, the player must travel through ten different stages fighting Galuf's unreasonably cute army. There are several different special magic powers that can be collected, including a fairy familiar, magic shield, and time slow, and a boss waits at the end of each stage.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Wind's Seed</em> tells the story of sister and brother, Meena and Otto, who possess the unique power of \"call\", allowing them to focus spiritual energy in order to cast magical spells. Once they arrive in a small village, they are asked to go to the Western forest, presumably to help gather some healing plants. However, they soon learn that it was a trap, and must defend themselves in order to survive...</p>\n<p>Even though it looks like a side-scrolling action game, <em>Wind's Seed</em> is essentially a \"light\" Japanese-style RPG, with the characteristic random enemies, turn-based combat, and automatic leveling up. There are also peaceful areas with inns and shops, where they can acquire healing and support items. The player controls only Meena and Otto. In every battle, it is necessary to raise the \"call level\" of them, in order to unleash more damaging spells; with a low call level, they won't be able to defeat their foes. Otto also has the ability to heal the party.</p>",

Humans were deported onto the Earth, where they formed five powerful kingdoms. The wisest of them, a king named Solomon, was known to have mysterious powers connections to the 72 most powerful demons...</p>\n<p>Years have passed, and demons attack human kingdoms. A young warrior named Shellstein is told to learn the truth about the legacy of Solomon, which is the key to defeating the demons...</p>\n<p><em>Wolfish Gallop: Legacy of the Solomon</em> is a RPG with strong elements of a strategy game. The player is able to move on a linear world map, as well as visit towns and dungeon-like areas; player-controlled characters participate in turn-based combat against various enemies, in traditional Japanese RPG style. Like in strategy games, the player can control multiple parties of characters, which can form army units. Different characters take the role of main heroes during the game (Chapter One begins with the king Duran seeking help against demonic invaders), and, beside \"important\" story-related characters, simple soldiers can also be recruited and participate in battles.</p>",

One day, returning to Y\u016br\u014d through the desert, Riku found a girl lying nearly unconscious on the sand. This girl is revealed to be Azusa, a modern-day Japanese schoolgirl who, thanks to a time warp, ended up in Varcias. Riku must now help Azusa return to her home world. But enemy forces are attacking Y\u016br\u014d, and the Empress is in desperate need of assistance.</p>\n<p><em>Y\u016br\u014d: Transient Sands</em> is an action RPG. The player controls Riku, manipulating him through vast hostile environments, returning to the town to rest and buy better weapons, armor, and healing items. Like in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Ys\">Ys</a> games, Riku dispatches of his enemies simply by running into them. Accumulated experience points eventually raise Riku's levels, making him stronger. The game features explicit sexual scenes.</p>",

They chat mostly about men, clothes, and sex. The conversation develops, until the two young women begin to get intimate with each other.</p>\n<p>The game starts with both Eri and Kazumi wearing clothes, and they gradually undress as the game progresses. A special attention is paid to the variety of lingerie both women wear. The player's input is confined to decision-making; giving different answers to the girls' questions to unlock different portions of text and new pictures. There is also a cursor shaped like an eye that the player can periodically use, but it serves mostly to click on the visible body part and advance the conversation.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/45773/idol-project/\"> first Idol Project</a>, the story of the sequel is directly related to to the anime series <em>Idol Project</em>, starring the same characters, with the young and ambitious Mimu Emilton as the protagonist. Mimu finds herself on a tropical island, where she must rise to fame by winning contests and promoting her singing skills. Like in the previous game, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to exploring the top-down city, visiting various places, searching for necessary people and raising the protagonist's parameters. Mimu has a much more detailed set of parameters than the hero of the previous game, including physical attributes as well as popularity rankings. The RPG element has been further enhanced by introducing random character (crazed fans and alike) who would sometimes attack Mimu on the city map and other locations.</p>\n<p>Like the anime, <em>Idol Project 2</em> has somewhat sexy, but \"cute\" graphics, as opposed to the adult overtones of the predecessor.</p>",

Basically, it is a brothel, but one that has only one employee - a girl named Candy, who is ready to help the customer realize his erotic fantasies.</p>\n<p>The game can be considered a \"sexual role-playing simulation\"; the only objective in the game is to reach 100% \"pleasure meter\" for the protagonist, by trying out all possible combinations of places, costumes, roles, positions, etc., unlocking the CGs in the process. The player is able to choose a location (school, hospital, etc.), a role for Candy (obedient house wife, scared school girl, etc.), as well as a variety of sexual positions. Once everything is selected, the scene plays automatically. Afterwards, the player is brought back to Mink, where he can continue to try out other combinations.</p>",

However, unlike most Japanese adventures, the game plays from a top-down perspective, allowing physical movement around the game world. Most of the gameplay is dedicated to walking around, finding important people and talking to them. Some of the dialogues have multiple conversation topics. The game has its own clock, which is advanced when the heroine visits different locations. Some of the events (such as lessons, beginning and end of work time, certain people being inc certain places, etc.) depend on this inner schedule, the goal sometimes becoming to catch the right person at the right time and place.</p>\n<p>The game has scenes with explicit sexual content.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The story of <em>Etemible: Tenj\u014d Muky\u016b</em> is based on Japanese mythology. The goddess Amaterasu hands an ancient sword to a young female warrior named Himiko, and requests her to save Takamagahara, the dwelling of Japanese gods, from the rampage of her chaotic brother Susanoo and his army of demons.</p>\n<p><em>Etemible: Tenj\u014d Muky\u016b</em> is a real-time strategy game. Each stage is a large-scale battle, during which the player controls several army units, each led by a \"general\" (Himiko or others). Both enemy and player-controlled units are moving across the map in real time. Whenever two opposing units meet each other, a battle ensues. The player has no control over it - the outcome is decided by the units' parameters, the health of their soldiers, strength and weaknesses, formation strategy the player chose before the battle, etc. The player can choose whether to watch the battle (displayed on a separate screen) or skip it. The interface is window-based, with different windows depicting characters, their parameters, mini-map, and a zoomed-in area of the player's choice.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Kumi is an ordinary Japanese teenage girl. At least she was ordinary until one day, walking back home, she spotted a shiny object falling from the sky into a nearby forest. Upon examining the object more closely, Kumi found a cute rabbit-like creature, who called himself Popp claimed to have come from a magical world. Popp granted Kumi the magical ability of shape-shifting: turning into an adult male of her choice... an ability Kumi will need in order to fulfill her mission: sexually satisfy female students and teachers from her high school...</p>\n<p><em>Majokko Kumi</em> is a traditional Japanese adventure game, without puzzle and with menu-based verb \"Look- Talk - Think - Move\" interaction. Story progression is linear. Most of the game is dedicated to depleting all available options until the game takes the player to a new screen. Sex scenes also feature a point-and-click mouse interface, with a single cursor for all the actions.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The second <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=magical+story+series\"> Magical Story Series</a> game is not connected to the predecessor story-wise, but has a similar premise. The heroine this time is a little girl named Rina, who has a crush on an older boy, whose name is Tatsuya. One night she sees a falling star and wishes to be a grown-up young woman. Miraculously, her wish is fulfilled; but the falling star is revealed to contain a mischievous imp, who grants Rina an ability to grow up and return to her normal self, as well as assume the appearance of other people...</p>\n<p>Like the first game, <em>Rina</em> plays like a typical Japanese adventure, with a \"Look-Talk-Think-Move\" command menu, no puzzles, and the standard requirement to \"trigger\" new commands by going through all the available ones, often more than one time.</p>\n<p>Unlike <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=magic+story+kumi\"> Kumi</a>, <em>Rina</em> cannot qualify as an adult game. There are implicit erotic situations and innuendo, but no explicit nudity or scenes with sexual content.</p>",

The number indicates the amount of squares the player can advance. As in most games of this kind, different squares can have a beneficial or damaging effect on the player's progress. Certain squares marked \"Item\" allow the player to buy items, which can give him advantage during mahjong parties or movement on the board. Most of the squares lead to a mahjong game against computer AI. If the player fails to beat the opponent in three rounds, it's Game Over.</p>",

Those two are also the reasons for her taking part in a mahjong championship, where she competes against the toughest (and prettiest) mahjong ladies. The defeated party agrees to have sex with the winner... on her conditions. </p>\n<p>The player selects one of the available eight mahjong opponents, most of which (with one or perhaps two exceptions) are pretty girls. Each player starts with 25000 points. If Chiruru runs out of points, it's Game Over; a victory over the princess' opponent leads to an explicit sex scene.</p>",

Yuu appears in the game, but is not the protagonist; the player controls four young women in four different scenarios: two of them, Yuri and Aya, on the Earth, and the other two, Ora and Sita, in an alien world, mixture of sci-fi and medieval fantasy. The story goes beyond the original anime by introducing a magical, sacred land known as Finality, populated by fantasy being, and calling the guardians (the four girl protagonist) to bring peace to the galaxy.</p>\n<p><em>Futatsu no Sekai</em> plays automatically for the most part, except key scenes which allow interaction - two, sometimes more choices that have to be done by the player. In many cases these choices are merely cosmetic, or may lead to a different text description and scene.</p>",

This peaceful (and pleasant) time-passing ends when the evil witch Saprinu appears in our dimension and attacks B-Ko. Saprinu's demonic plan is to steal precious energy from female virgins. Now it's time for B-Ko's faithful servant, a young man known as Alpha, to \"intercept\" the poor virgins (using his own methods), before they fall prey to Saprinu...</p>\n<p><em>Mah\u014d Sh\u014djo B-Ko</em> walks a fine line between an adventure game (Japanese-style) and visual novel; the interaction is very limited, with only three commands (Look, Talk, Move) and no sub-menus. It also features navigation (menu-based) through various parts of the school. Some conversations offer dialogue choices, typically for visual novels.</p>",

But it also opened virtual portals to another dimensions. The ruler of one of them, the magical empire Lemuria, concocted a plan to use the computer's energy in order to destroy the Earth. Luckily, not everyone in Lemuria shared his views, including a beautiful girl named Lares, who contacted a group of computer-loving high-school girls in Japan, and turned them into super-heroines who fight in cyberspace!</p>\n<p>The game is a turn-based strategy/RPG hybrid, a popular sub-genre among Japanese games. As in most games of this kind, extensive cut-scenes lead to long strategic battles, which take place on a top-down screen and allow turn-based navigation of the characters. The all-female player-controlled party can execute punches and kicks when enemy is in range, as well as magic spells. </p>\n<p>When certain enemy characters (also female) or player-controlled characters die, a nude picture of said character is displayed.</p>",

The protagonist, a young man named Kyouichi, finds himself in an old mansion, which seems to contain an evil energy - dead bodies, ghosts, apparitions haunt Kyouichi, who has to recall childhood events and the incestuous feelings towards his sister.</p>\n<p>The second story is named <em>Cosplaytor II</em> (<em>sic</em>), and is set in Tokyo, in 2019. Entertainment as we know it has disappeared off the face of the Earth, replaced by a global virtual reality game, that became the ultimate reality for many people. The player controls an agent known only by his codename (\"Z\"), who has to investigate criminal occurrences that might lead to a world-wide cyber-conspiracy.</p>\n<p>Both stories have the same kind of gameplay, which is closer to a visual novel than to \"real\" Japanese adventure. There are command menus, but they are context-related and resemble more choices of a visual novel that adventure game interaction. Some choices might lead to a Game Over.</p>",

The interaction consists mainly of small command menus, until the heroine becomes intimate with another character.

In any case, a young spoiled boy named Frito, from a rich Magic World family, has to get married - and his father tells him to choose a spouse from our world. Frito's trusted servant, an elf-like creature named Fin, finds three suitable girls: a Japanese high-school student (naturally), a maid, and a Wild West farmer girl. Who will become the happy bride?..</p>\n<p><em>Mischif</em> (<em>sic</em>) is a Japanese adventure, with verb commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", \"Think\", etc.), which usually have to be depleted to advance the story. It is possible to \"tackle\" the girls in any order. Once the player character becomes intimate with a girl, the game switches to a point-and-click interface with a variety of sexual commands. It is also possible to die in the game by selecting the wrong command in certain situations.</p>",

The humans had to re-build their civilization, and religion played an important part in the new world. A new religion, which claimed to be \"the faith of love\", began to spread through the world. Joe, a young and enthusiastic female knight and preacher, heads to a remote village in order to convert the non-believers to the new religion. But will her own faith be challenged when she discovers the truth about our world?..</p>\n<p><em>Mission</em> is a Japanese-style RPG, with most characteristic ingredients such as top-down world map navigation, linear story, simple combat mechanics, automatic leveling up, etc. Unlike most Japanese RPGs of the time, the enemies are visible walking on the world map and in dungeons; contact with enemies initiates a battle. A somewhat unusual feature is the necessity to choose participants (both enemy and player-controlled) before every battle, which then turns into a one-on-one turn-based fight.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The game is based on the manga series <em>Moryou Senki Madara</em>. The story is set in a mythological era in Japan, and focuses on twin brothers, Madara and Kage-Ou (\"Shadow King\"), sons of the evil Emperor Miroku. While Kage-Ou follows in the footsteps of his father, Madara fights against him and for the good of mankind. The game begins as Madara is gravely wounded in his fight against Miroku, but is saved by a young warrior named Seishinja, who lives together with his sister Himika. Before Madara is cured, Seishinja has to fight demons himself, with the help of the legendary sword Kusanagi.</p>\n<p>The game has traditional Japanese RPG ingredients, such as a linear story, turn-based combat, and automatic leveling. The interface, however, is different than in most RPGs, having an adventure-like menu with icon commands. The player advances in the game by traveling to different locations (still via the command menu), and battles are pre-set, dictated by the story. Beside regular attacking, many special martial moves and magic can be used.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Once upon a time, there was a young boy who loved motorcycles. Riding through the night on his bike was what he enjoyed most - until one night he crashed into a car, and was taken to hospital. There, he wakes up to find out that he'll have to go through some injections and infusions, which scares him so much that he faints... and immediately finds himself mysterious transported to a bizarre magical realm, somewhat inspired by <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, with well-dressed rabbits, smoking caterpillars, but also plenty of cute girls. It turns out that this Wonderland isn't that bad - but how hard will it be to conquer the hearts of its pretty inhabitants?..</p>\n<p><em>Night Shifter</em> is an adventure game. Although it was made by a Japanese company, it has elements of a Western adventure. The gameplay emphasizes exploration and conversation choices. The hero can move through top-down locations. When he reaches a place of interest, the perspective switches to first-person, displaying menu-based commands. </p>\n<p>A stand-out feature of the game is the possibility to play it in either Lawful or Chaotic ways. Most of the locations in the two play modes overlap, but the starting locations and many events are completely different. The player can choose Lawful or Chaotic path from the main menu; it is impossible to change it afterwards.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Noltia</em> contains three scenarios, which are not related to each other story-wise. All the three share traditional Japanese adventure gameplay, with \"Look - Talk - Think\" verb command pattern, no inventory, no puzzles, and plenty of text.</p>\n<p>The first one can be played as either of its two main characters - the boy Aruto or the girl Kyoko. Both are not what they seem to be: Aruto is working for a registry organization in the World of the Dead, and he has to bring Kyoko to judgment, where it will be decided whether she goes to heaven or hell after death. However, Kyoko is actually an angel, whose goal is to save Aruto from killing himself. Both characters have special bars - the well-being of the protagonist and the proximity of the opponent to the protagonist's goal. Command choices can increase or decrease either of these statistics. Wrong choices can lead to Game Over.</p>\n<p>The second scenario casts the player in the role of a high-school student named Yoshihiko, who is hired by a gym teacher to take erotic pictures of high-school girls and bring them to him. This scenario allows movement through school locations (menu command \"Move\"), and, depending on the player's choices, Yoshihiko can succeed in taking the most erotically satisfying pictures, or achieve one of the \"bad\" endings.</p>\n<p>The third scenario is a realistic depiction of a relationship between a young man named Eiji and his little sister Miwa. The player can choose to play as either one of them. Eiji is dating Miwa's schoolmate, and Miwa tries to understand the change in her own feelings. In this episode, the gameplay is rather straight-forward Japanese adventure.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Panic Dolls</em>, three ordinary Japanese school girls suddenly discover that Miki, their school nurse, is in fact a \"Master Dragoon\", a super-heroine fighting for a powerful galactic organization. Their current adversary is the evil warlord Barado and his emissary, the sexy yet deadly monster-summoner Kyuuma. The three girls turn into the super-heroines Phoenix Rose, Tiger Lily, and Tortoise Cheery - the Power Dolls - and venture into Barado's dungeons to defeat him once and for all...</p>\n<p>...only the player won't be helping them. In a sudden twist, the player is given control of the evil Kyuuma. The girls are automatically walking through the isometric, maze-like dungeons, trying to find the exit. The player's goal is to help Kyuuma summon monsters to stop them. As the girls walk, their attack level increases (from 0 to 4), and so does Kyuuma's summoning level. At level 4, she can summon the most powerful monsters in each category (giants, demons, spirits, etc.). When the monster is placed into the dungeon, it will try to find its way to the girls. Depending on the girls' level and the monster's level, the battle will decrease the girls' level by a certain number. The trick is to position different monsters in such a way that the girls will have to face a monster when they are all at level 0. Losing a battle at level 0 will cause a girl to become disoriented and wander off, turning into easier prey for the monsters, and eventually getting killed in a battle.</p>\n<p>The game doesn't stop if the girls successfully traverse a dungeon. The player can simply let them walk and advance to the next dungeon screen. Depending on where and how the player disposes of the girls, the game ends with a different scene.</p>\n<p>The game has cut-scenes with explicit sexual content.</p>",

Or maybe the game took him to another world, which will from now on become part of his life?..</p>\n<p>The larger portion of <em>Power Slave</em> plays like a Japanese adventure, most of the gameplay being dedicated to choosing locations from the town map, triggering events and advancing the story. The omnipresent \"Look - Talk - Move\" menu appears at some locations. However, there are also several turn-based battles in the game. Those battles are always story-related, take place on an isometric screen, and are fought against a single enemy. Tetsuya can attack physically, defend, or spend two turns concentrating his spiritual energy in order to execute a special attack. The key to winning the battles lies in predicting the opponent's move, which can be deduced from their dialogue lines.</p>\n<p><em>Power Slave</em> has explicit sex scenes. Unlike in most other similar games, many of them are animated, using 2D anime-style graphics.</p>",

Afterwards, he'll have to go back - so there is no time to lose! The boy must do something about all those pretty girls in his school. But in order to capture their hearts, he will have to know them better...</p>\n<p><em>Pure</em> is a Japanese-style adventure game that takes place entirely in the school. At each location of the school (classroom, tennis court, etc.), the player is given the same menu of commands, which are Look, Talk, Ask, Show, Move, Search, Use, and Give. Each of these commands list to a sub-menu of selectable objects; the last two deal with inventory items the player might obtain. There are no real puzzles, but at certain points the player has to do more than just try to trigger the next scene - asking the right question or showing the right item might do the trick.</p>",

One day, her friends find her on the floor, unconscious. They bring her to the young school doctor, who also happens to be the protagonist of this game. The hero is impressed by Shimeji's beauty, but he is also determined to find the cause of her depression. Piece by piece he uncovers the truth about Shimeji's life...</p>\n<p>The game is composed mainly of text accompanied by pictures. Movement and most of the actions are done automatically by the game. Sometimes the player has to choose an action from two or more available ones, but often only one choice advances the game.

The game is entirely dedicated to sex and can be therefore considered a sex simulation. There are 48 young girls to choose from. Each of them has a name and a short biography, including likes and dislikes, sexual experience, etc. After choosing a girl, the game has to match her portrait by clicking on one of the four cards hiding pictures of different girls. Then the player goes through the girl's bio, asking a limited amount of questions. Then it is time to choose one of the many available sexual positions, trying to choose the one the girl would be most comfortable with, according to her data known to the player. The actual sex scene proceeds then automatically.</p>",

The introduction story tells us that in 1912, the famous American businessman J.P.Morgan founded a golf tournament in Alaska. The best golfers from all over the world came to compete, but nobody from Japan... so naturally, the player has to correct that!</p>\n<p>Referring to itself as a \"3D simulation golf game\", <em>Alaskan Malamute G.C.</em> features pseudo-3D terrain with rotatable camera. The player is able to adjust his golfer's position, strength, direction, and style of the shot. It is possible to create own players with different statistics. The game has various play modes, with up to 4 players competing in each; those modes include regular play, tournament, and training.</p>",

However, the fights themselves are strictly card-based. A rather unique feature of the game is the sexual nature of the fights. Each card depicts a certain sexual action. Every character has strength and weaknesses to different sexual techniques, so in order to win, the player must choose the right cards to play. Identical cards can be used in combos, dealing greater \"damage\". Playing a card leads to a sexually explicit, animated short scene depicting the action in question.</p>",

Her curious nature eventually leads her to some interesting acquaintances, including magic users and adventurers, who help her to uncover a threat to her family and country. The princess has to travel through a dangerous forest with her best buddy Meron, in order to protect Baskin from danger.</p>\n<p><em>31...</em> is a Japanese-style adventure game. The interaction is minimal, usually restricted to two or three commands (mostly Look or Talk) with a few sub-menus at most. Usually, the player advances the story and proceeds automatically when all the options at the screen are depleted. However, there is also menu-based navigation (in the forest, etc.), which requires memorizing ways and choosing directions correctly.</p>\n<p>The game contains scenes with nudity and sexual situations.</p>",

In the beginning of the game the player is given the option to choose one of the three available fighters. Each one has an introduction story. Sayaka witnesses the murder of her father, a circus acrobat, by a witch known as Lavender; her story begins with a fight against her. Mai's and Mercedes' stories are one and the same; they are fighting for dominance in modern-day Japan, and fight each other in the first round of their stories.</p>\n<p>Despite looking like a fighting game, <em>Battle Queen</em> is strategy-, not action-oriented. The fights are turn-based. The player can choose between different moves, including four kinds of attack, jump, defend, special attacks, etc. Special attacks can only be executed after performing a sufficient amount of other moves.</p>\n<p>Each move is displayed as an anime-style image. The girls lose parts of their clothes when being hit. Defeating the opponent results in a sex scene.</p>",

The player first chooses a birthday and a name for his alter ego. Then he is presented with a calendar for the year. Visiting different locations (movies, shopping mall, etc.) leads to meetings with different girls. After learning their phone numbers, it becomes possible to call them and set a date. During dates, the player often has to choose between different dialogue lines to please the girl. It is also possible to buy present for the ladies. It is entirely possible to set dates with multiple girls, but they might meet each other and become jealous. Girls also don't take it lightly if you don't appear on a date. Finally, at the protagonist's next birthday, the most impressed girl will agree to have sex with him. The sex scenes are explicit, but rather few.</p>",

The actual gameplay is nearly identical to that of <em>Birthdays</em>, with a few interface changes and minor tweaks (for example, the game pauses automatically to remind the player of his alter ego's date). There are only four girls here, and the protagonist meets them right at the beginning, as opposed to <em>Birthdays</em>, where there were eight different girls met at different locations. There are, however, more detailed conversations with the girls, and some new choices during dates (such as holding hands, etc.). There are explicit sex scenes, but they only appear during the game's endings.</p>",

She says that girls in different dimensions are in grave danger, and Shounosuke has to save them...</p>\n<p><em>Bomber Quest</em> has elements of both strategy/puzzle game and RPG. Each of the six girls has a different scenario, accessible from the beginning. Each scenario puts the player character into a top-down environment.

The player can rotate the pieces and then place them onto the ground. The goal is to build a maze that would cover possibly large ground, gaining access to important locations and items.

The battles are viewed from first-person perspective and are turn-based. Shounosuke can only use physical attacks and items.

        "description": "<p><em>Bunkasai</em> puts the player in the role of a male Japanese high-school student. One day his teacher tells him about the upcoming culture festival, giving him the assignment to help his lovely classmate Mia in the preparations. Naturally, the young man's mind is more directed towards... err... other aspects of Mia's personality. But what starts as a simple collaboration between high-school students soon turns into a drama full of violence and difficult decisions to make...</p>\n<p>The game is a Japanese-style adventure with reduced command menu and interaction. At every given screen, there are a few commands (mostly just two), sometimes the standard Look and Talk, sometimes context-based actions. Usually the story advances automatically when the player has gone through all the commands several times.</p>\n<p>The game has nudity and explicit sex scenes.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Burning Dragon</em> begins with an entirely text-less intro depicting an army of jetpack-using robots, and several war planes being dispatched against them. Thus, there can only be speculations about its story, but apparently \"Burning Dragon\" is the jet the player controls. The game is a vertically scrolling shooter with standard characteristics of the genre: limited continues, power-ups, etc. The stages are not numbered, but presented as a continuous whole. The jet can sustain several hits before losing a life, which, in its turn, brings it back to the last checkpoint. Checkpoints tend to be rather frequent, compared to other games of this genre. After having lost several life, it's Game Over; but the remaining amount of Continues still brings the player back to the checkpoint, without the necessity to replay a larger portion of the game.</p>\n<p>Most of the time the player-controlled jet fights against other jets, tanks, turrets, etc. Boss enemies appear at certain points to pose an additional challenge. Power-ups pop out usually after destroying certain parts of the scenery (buildings, etc.). Power-ups are shaped like constantly changing letters; depending on which letter it turned into when the jet touched it, they can grant various enhancements to it, which include rapid fire, additional cannons, missiles, etc.</p>",

Then the player is invited to character creation. There are a total of 12 pre-made characters of various classes (fighter, knight, magician, cleric, etc.) and vastly different initial statistics, which the player can re-assign. Player statistics include hit points, attack, armor class, magic power, and luck. </p>\n<p>Afterwards, the player is thrown into a randomly generated isometric dungeon, which must be uncovered by exploration. Unlike early dungeon crawlers, the movement occurs in real time, and enemies appear randomly, inviting the player to deal with them in turn-based style. </p>\n<p>There are various stones with clues scattered around the dungeons, as well as treasure chests, which might contain weapons, armor, or various healing and stat-enhancing spells.</p>",

The abstract \"Blue\" and \"Red\" countries (controlled by the player and computer AI, respectively) are at war with each other. The gameplay is turn-based. The player first has to produce his army units using the power plants in his country. Then he moves these units over the top-down map. The goal is to conquer the capital city of the enemy. Naturally, the player's country also has cities, and it is necessary to protect them from enemy attacks.</p>\n<p>The units include tanks, planes, and ships, as well as non-combat variety such as trucks that deliver supplies to the cities. When player-controlled and enemy units are positioned near each other on the map, a battle ensues. The outcome of the battle depends on the statistics of the corresponding units.</p>",

Time passes regardless of the player's actions, and if it takes too long for the player to prepare his army, the enemy will advance and conquer his land.</p>\n<p>There are 12 different scenarios to choose from. Like other <em>Daisenryaku</em> games, there are no concrete historical wars among the game's scenarios, and no specific countries (scenarios like \"Iceland\" or \"Great Wall\" are the same abstract maps as the others). As always, the wars occur between \"color\" armies - Red, Blue, Yellow, etc. The player must first choose which army he wants to control. Headquarters require special management, including money, resources, fuel, etc. </p>\n<p>Other aspects of the game are similar to the previous <em>Daisenryaku</em> and include protection for the cities, management of the army, and the actual combat mechanics - moving tanks, planes, and other types of units on the top-down map. Combat occurs when player's and enemy units are near each other, and evolves automatically.</p>\n<p><em>Daisenryaku IV</em> also allows playing scenarios against other players online over the modem.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Sayaka is a female exchange student and supposedly the main love interest of the hero Shoutarou; however, the game's story is hardly dedicated to her; consisting instead of a series of Shoutarou's numerous encounters with young women of different kinds - nurse, police officer, shy neighbor, S&amp;M queen, etc. </p>\n<p>The gameplay is divided into two modes. The first is Japanese adventure with very simplistic gameplay: in each screen, the player has to press the icons that represent the commands \"Look\", \"Talk\", and \"Move\", several times, to trigger a sex scene and to move to the next location.  The second mode are timed arcade-like sequences, which are triggered by the story events and are necessary to complete in order to advance the game. The player has to navigate Shoutarou on a top-down screen, repeatedly pressing a button to unravel an erotic picture hidden beneath. Various enemies (most commonly fire bombs) are trying to collide with Shoutarou. Getting hit results in a loss of a \"life\", after having lost all the lives, the game is over. Power-ups such as additional time, invulnerability, etc., appear on the screen randomly. Each next sequence is typically more difficult than the previous one.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Cherry Jam</em> is a visual novel with a slight inclination towards dating simulation. The hero is a nameless young man who is dating a girl named Tomoyo. The game is dedicated to their relationship, more precisely the dates they have together. As usually in visual novels, the basic premise is a flow of text accompanying still images, with occasional decisions that steer the story in a different direction. However, in <em>Cherry Jam</em> the player has to choose the protagonist's answers or actions very frequently. Those decisions influence Tomoyo's mood and eventually the outcome of the date. Many decisions also lead to a premature end of the game.</p>\n<p>The player also has to manage the protagonist's finances. Presents for Tomoyo and other expenses are deduced from the protagonist's overall wealth, so the player has to balance between keeping Tomoyo happy and not becoming broke. </p>\n<p>There is a \"novel mode\" in the game, which becomes accessible after the first game \"death\". This mode re-tells the entire story so far from the point of view of Tomoyo.</p>",

Player-controlled character competes against four young girls. The rules of the game are rather simple: each player is dealt ten cards. Following clockwise turns, each player has either to play a card that has a higher value than the previous one, or pass. Winning a hand allows the player to begin the next turn with the card of his/her choice. It is also possible to play several cards of the same value at once. Whoever has played all the ten cards first wins the round.</p>\n<p>After three rounds, a cut-scene follows, during which the defeated character shares sexual experiences from her life, presented as sexually explicit images with text. Afterwards, the card game is resumed.</p>",

The plot involves a faraway planet sunken in corruption and sexual crimes; young girls have been kidnapped and are about to fall victims to terrible experiments. An ordinary young boy names Kenjirou is assigned with the task to travel to the building where the girls are kept, and to liberate them. To do that, he first needs to - logically - destroy layers of bricks with a ball!</p>\n<p>The player controls Kenjirou in person, his head adorned by a construction worker hat. Kenjirou runs left and right, hitting the ball with his head, hands, or feet (controlled simply by letting the ball fall at the appropriate angle). The bricks come in different colors; red ones are destroyed in one hit, blue ones require two, etc. Higher levels feature more complex brick systems, and more tough-to-break bricks. </p>\n<p>Kenjirou has limited lives, and the game is over when he lets the ball hit the floor too many times, losing all of them. Some bricks produce power-ups when destroyed; these include additional time for Kenjirou to finish the level, slowing down the ball, etc. </p>\n<p>Every level is an erotic picture obscured by the bricks and unclear colors. Once all the bricks have been destroyed, the picture becomes clear, and a sex scene follows, after which the hero ascends to the next floor, continue his perilous quest for demolition and carnal pleasure.</p>",

One day, Ryouta finds a cute black bunny and brings it home; the next morning, the bunny turns into a sexy black-haired girl! Needless to say the activities the two perform during the course of the game do not include playing chess or discussing philosophy. But Ryouta is not satisfied with the \"bunny girl\" alone, what with all those cute female schoolmates around him...</p>\n<p><em>Coin</em> is a visual novel with an emphasis on decision-making. Choices that the player has to make periodically lead to different scenes. Many of the choices (for example, raping a girl) are considered \"wrong\" and lead to a premature ending of the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Around the turn of the millennium, global warming has become a reality. Abusing energy and the Earth's resources, humanity has driven itself to a point where normal life on Earth could no longer exist. Drastic rise of temperatures caused planet-wide dehydration. The only way to keep existing was through the Cyber Net, a virtual reality system. But soon the Cyber Net began to suffer from continuous assaults by hackers, who programmed lethal viruses into it. Thus, the Cyber Police was born. The protagonist of the game is a high-ranked officer of Cyber Police. With the help of his team, he has to solve the hacker problem once and for all.</p>\n<p><em>Cyber Illusion</em> is a Japanese-style adventure. The interaction with the game world is performed by choosing the menu commands Look, Talk, Move, as well as context-specific ones that appear during some scenes. It is also possible to influence the course of the story by making choices at certain points. </p>\n<p>The game has explicit sex scenes, which are interactive and feature a point-and-click interface.</p>",

The player can compete against up to 3 computer opponents.</p>\n<p>Each scenario begins with a historical event that led to its existence; afterwards, the player is free to re-write or change history his/her own way. Beside the actual strategic war gameplay, the game also includes diplomacy options (such as asking another country for support, signing an agreement, etc.) Events occur as a result of the player's action (cities captured and destroyed, countries capitulating, etc.) The player moves the units over the top-down map; a battle occurs when the player's and enemy units are in proximity. Battles are displayed graphically, but evolve automatically, without the player's input. The player needs to calculate the amount, strength, and type of units (infantry, tank, planes, etc.), weighing the pros and contras of engaging the enemy to secure victory.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The events of the game take place shortly after the ending of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=dead+brain+sakebi\"> first game</a>. The devastating zombie invasion, caused by the scientist Dr. Cooger and his resurrection medicine, was finally stopped, and the young hero Cole could marry his sweetheart Sheila. But alas, if only everything could be so simple... A biker gang starts terrorizing the town. Sheila and Cole find a dead body in Cole's apartment. And soon they discover that not all the traces of the resurrection medicine were destroyed...</p>\n<p>Like its predecessor, <em>Dead of the Brain 2</em> is a horror adventure. The gameplay follows the Japanese template - no puzzles, no physical movement, reduced interaction. The interface has been greatly simplified: all the actions except moving (automatically takes Cole to another location) can be performed by highlighting an object or a person on the screen and confirming. Like in the first game, there are timed tasks (mostly involving enemy encounters), during which the player has to perform an action before time runs out. Failure to do so, or performing an incorrect action, leads to Game Over.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Oracle of Delphi was the ultimate place of wisdom, the home of the Seven Great Wisemen of Greece, known for the famous aphorisms inscribed on its temple's walls (such as \"know thyself\"). Indeed, only the wisest of men can be worthy of learning his fate from the Oracle. A young prince from Babylon has to travel through the world of the Hellenist era, meeting wise people and accumulating knowledge, which is a precious treasure and a powerful weapon...</p>\n<p><em>Delphi no Shintaku</em> is a game that combines elements from different genres. The structure of the story mode resembles Western 3rd person point-and-click adventures. The player navigates the young hero through the cities of Greece and their surroundings by clicking on the appropriate place on the screen, being able to move in all directions. Each city typically consists of several screens, including famous landmarks (such as the Colossus on Rhodos). Dialogue icon is displayed when a conversation with a character is possible. </p>\n<p>However, the actual challenge of the game lies in participating in quiz \"battles\" against the game's characters. Many characters will suggest to test the hero's knowledge, and in order to advance in the game, the player must agree and complete their quiz. A quiz usually contains two or more timed questions. The player has to quickly choose the correct one of the four available answers. When a quiz is complete, the player receives items needed to make progress in the game. The quiz questions belong to diverse topics, from classical literature to video game trivia.</p>\n<p>Beside the story mode, there are also many other \"lesser\" modes, which can be considered mini-games. Some of them are various types of quiz - timed, competing against computer (or another player), game show-like tournament, etc. Others are mind games, which include finding differences between two pictures and arranging pieces of a puzzle.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The powerful god known as Black B was securely sealed, preventing his powers from corrupting humans. The people of the Kingdom enjoyed a prosperous, peaceful life. But that ended when the nearby country, ruled by a ruthless Empress, heard of the sealed god. The Empire attacked the Kingdom, which had no other choice but release Black B and use his powers to defend themselves. Black B readily agreed to help, on one condition: all the generals in his army must be female...</p>\n<p><em>Dengeki Division</em> is a turn-based strategy/RPG hybrid. The player's first input is to throw dice to determine the amount of points that can be used to raised the parameters (strength, intelligence, agility, etc.) of the female generals. The player also assigns character classes (warrior, monk, magician, etc.) to them. Afterwards, the story unrolls; battles are dictated by the story, and there is no movement in the game outside of the battle field. Combat takes place on isometric locations, where only the immediate surroundings of the player-controlled characters are shown. The player then navigates the characters over the field, attacking enemies when they are in range of physical attacks or magic spells. Hurting a female enemy character (or sustaining damage) triggers a small nude picture of said character.</p>",

Human beings were forces to construct huge cities in artificial environment, known as \"cyclones\". New technology has opened ways to new kinds of entertainment - namely violent battles between cybernetically enhanced fighters...</p>\n<p><em>Diver's</em> is a simulation game somewhat similar to  Princess Maker with cut-scenes (mostly of erotic nature) breaking the daily training routine. Taking the role of a manager named Shirou, the player can choose to train one of the four available female fighters. The goal is to raise the girl's battle parameters by filling our her schedule with daily assignments. These include various kinds of physical training (attack, defense, etc.), mental exercises, sparring with a partner, etc. In order to keep the girl relaxed, it is necessary to rest from time to time, as well as perform some leisurely activities, such as shopping, gambling, or relaxing in a spa.</p>\n<p>The event battles are presented as short animated clips of the opponent attacking the girl of player's choice. There is no interaction during the battles, and their outcome depends on the fighters' parameters, as well as advices the player has to give his/her fighter before the battle.</p>",

A powerful man contacts Midori and asks to investigate a matter concerning his business; at the same time, Satoru is preoccupied with cases of kidnapping, the victims always being young and pretty girls... </p>\n<p>This is the original release that served as a prototype for the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=cobra+mission+dos\"> better-known title of the same name</a>, which was developed by a different company and has major differences in gameplay, location design, and story.</p>\n<p>In this version, the main gameplay mechanics also involve exploring the top-down Cobra City, fighting random enemies from first-person view, gaining experience, leveling up, buying weapons and equipment, etc. However, the battles are strictly turn-based, having no action element whatsoever. Items cannot be found on the overhead map. Locations emphasize a Japanese setting, and many story sequences present in the later version are either absent or different.</p>",

One day, Mink tells her \"master\" about the floating continent Norland. Rumors say that a golden tablet of immense value is hidden somewhere on that continent. Asuta and Mink travel to Norland and try to enter the Queen's palace. However, it seems that the people of Norland only have respect to those who are proficient in the ancient game of mahjong. Mink quickly teaches Asuta how to play the game, and they challenge the famous people (read: young, pretty women) of the country to the bloodless battle!</p>\n<p><em>DoraDora Emotion</em> is a combination of adventure, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=mahjong\"> mahjong</a> board game, and interactive sex scenes. The adventure gameplay consists mainly of exploring the land of Norland. The locations are accessed via a map. The player clicks on objects of interest in order to receive information and advance the story. From time to time, mahjong matches will be held, as dictated by the story. It is required to win a match in order to proceed in the game. The interactive sex scenes feature a point-and-click interface with \"smart cursor\", which turns into various icons (mouth, hand, etc.) depending on the situation and the body part the player wishes to interact with.</p>",

The game recognizes verb commands typed in kana (Japanese syllable system) or Latin alphabet. For convenience, some of the most common verb commands (Look, Take, etc.) can be accessed by pressing a corresponding button, but the player still has to type the name of an object. This remake also helps the player to interact with the environment by displaying a list of objects after the player has typed a command.</p>\n<p>The most notable feature of the remake is the addition of graphics. Every location has a unique background picture, on which the text is super-imposed.</p>",

At the beginning of the year, new students enter the school, and Naomi's task is to show them around and help them - which she does in a very particular fashion...</p>\n<p>The game consists mainly of pornographic scenes; everything else is reduced to the minimum. Only five characters (besides Naomi) appear in the game, all of them new female students. There is menu-based navigation on the school map, but outside of the sex scenes, there is no other kind of interaction. During the sex scenes, however, a wide variety of actions is available. Naomi's partners have a special \"pleasure meter\"; the goal is to fill it by gradually performing the actions the girl approves of, which effectively turns the game into a simulation of sex. Despite this pleasure meter, most of the scenes include rather irregular sexual activities and torture.</p>",

A group of survivors has escaped into a cave, and it is from there that the nameless hero of the game begins his adventure.</p>\n<p>Similarly to <em>Kinpukurin's</em> earlier RPG <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/44176/free-will-knight-of-argent/\"> Free Will</a>, <em>Faladia</em> combines elements of Japanese RPG (top-down navigation, random turn-based battles with simple mechanics, etc.) with a more \"Western\" approach to RPG design. The gameplay is focused on exploration rather than on linear advancement with scripted story events. Instead of the usual Japanese practice of assigning a few story-related party members, <em>Faladia</em> allows to recruit most of the NPCs the player encounters in towns (up to 9 active characters). The player can also choose one of the four ways of interaction with every NPC: neutral, \"loving\", haggling, and aggressive. Aggressive behavior invariably leads to fight; it is therefore possible to attack every NPC in the game (though in most cases it results in the death of the underpowered hero).</p>",

Human beings have lost connection to the culture of the past. The huge city doesn't even have a name, and is simply called \"City\". Poor people live in the slums, and have no access to the quarters of the rich. Corruption reigns. The hero of the game belongs to an organization of assassins known as \"Card\". His last mission is to kill corrupted policemen who have been trafficking drugs. The hero must hide, but his relationships with other \"Card\" members are anything but clear...</p>\n<p><em>Four Flush</em> is essentially a visual novel, though it offers more choices of locations and dialogue options that it is usual for games of this genre. There is no fixed command-based interaction. Most of the game progression, despite the presence of location and dialogue choices, is linear. There are a few scenes with nudity and descriptions of sex, though not particularly \"hardcore\".</p>",

A league of nations was formed, consisting of \"companions\" from different countries. Suzuki, the representative of Japan, was also the founder of the most prestigious school of the new era -  St. Innocence Girls High School. The graduates were invited to a grand opening held by a company that was successful in manufacturing giant robots. But terrorists of an unknown origin assaulted the place, killing most of the people. All the clues lead to St. Innocence school. Suzuki sends an agent (codename \"Osamu\") to infiltrate the school and find out what is happening.</p>\n<p>The game is a Japanese-style RPG/strategy hybrid, set almost entirely within the high school. The RPG aspect is stronger than it is usually in games of this types, manifested itself not only in leveling system (experience points are awarded for each attack), equipment, usage of money, etc., but also in top-down exploration outside of the battles. Battles are usually dictated by the plot (not random), and occur in large top-down environments, which are navigated by the party of heroes in turn-based style.</p>\n<p>Battles usually end with cut-scenes featuring nudity and sexual situations.</p>",

        "description": "<p>By the end of the 20th century, women have acquired a prominent role in the human society. Entertainment, arts, and politics are increasingly dominated by women. Therefore, a special emphasis is put on educating young women, preparing them for the turbulent social life. The world's most prestigious educational institution is the Japanese Eikou High School. Becoming a teacher in that school is the highpoint of the career of the protagonist, Takigawa Noboru. But as it always happens (well, at least in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=hentai\"> bish\u014djo</a> games), the moment the hero encounters all those gorgeous female colleagues and students, he forgets all about education...</p>\n<p><em>Ikenai H\u014dkago</em> is a rather traditional Japanese-style adventure. It is set entirely in the school, and includes typical sub-locations such as classrooms, gym, teachers room, tennis court, etc. Every screen is accompanied by the verb commands Look, Talk, Examine, and Move. There are no sub-menus for interaction with objects. The player is mostly free to wander around the school (via the Move commands in the menu), but events are usually \"triggered\" by repeatedly visiting different locations.</p>",

However, it was all but destroyed by a life form known as \"Barius\", a parasitic creature that caused living beings to completely give up to their sexual instinct and innate aggressive tendencies, effectively turning them into monsters. To avoid global contamination, the inhabitants of Cicero left their planet. The remaining creatures, infected with Barius, used a capsule capable of space travel, and eventually showed up in our galaxy. The capsule containing ferocious monsters is nearing the Earth. Unaware of this unimaginable danger, the protagonist of the game, a young teacher in a girls high school, thinks of nothing but sexual pleasures...</p>\n<p><em>Gakuen Monogatari '93: The Instinct</em> is a Japanese-style adventure with constant menu-based interface. Usually the player has to complete a certain task in every specific room before being able to explore further. The verb commands typically lead to sub-menus of objects and characters that are possible to interact with. Beside the usual \"Look\", \"Talk\", and \"Move\", the commands also include the more rare (in Japanese adventures) \"Take\" and \"Use\", which allows possession and manipulation of inventory items.</p>",

One day, a maniac breaks into the school, and, holding the protagonist and the students at gunpoint. He then holds them hostage and forces them to perform violent and humiliating sexual acts with each other. The whole story of the game is basically a long stretch of such acts, while the maniac (and the protagonist) have to deal with new situations, such as arrival of police, journalists, etc.</p>\n<p>The gameplay consists of making decisions. Every situation offers a limited set of timed choices to the player. For example, he can have the protagonist to obey everything the maniac says, beg his mercy, choose a victim, choose concrete actions to be performed with the victim, etc. However, the game's structure mostly requires the protagonist to do the awful actions one way or the other, because most attempts at disobeying the maniac's orders result in the protagonist's death.</p>",

One evening, just after hearing on the news that someone has stolen a tiger, he goes out to a convenience store. On the way back, in a dark alley, he notices a strange creature, a young girl with cat ears and tail. She doesn't seem to remember anything about herself, except her name beginning with the syllable \"Mi...\", which afterwards earns her the nickname Mi. Yuuji brings her to his house and tries to introduce her to the world of humans. (which, naturally, also involves techniques of human procreation). But will Yuuji be able to keep Mi as his companion (sexual and otherwise), or will he have to face her mysterious past?..</p>\n<p><em>Radical Sequence</em> is a Japanese-style adventure game. There are no puzzles, and the player advances simply by selecting verb commands (which may vary according to the situation, but usually include \"Examine\", \"Talk\", \"Ask\", \"Action\", and \"Move\") and combining them with objects that pop out in the next menu. The player can move between various locations (also via a menu), but it is usually necessary to \"trigger\" events by executing specific commands.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A biological experiment that began in 1993 led to a terrible disaster in the beginning of 21st century. A virus that turned living beings into mutants and monsters has been unleashed. Soon the Earth turned into a terrifying place of chaos, as more and more human beings became infected. Unspeakable violence obliterated human civilization. Within a few years, humanity was on the verge of total annihilation. The Era of Darkness began.</p>\n<p>But not all hope was lost. Humans began building cities known as \"Domes\", isolated from the wilderness, protected by glass from all sides, cut from natural resources. It was possible to start building civilization anew. </p>\n<p>On one fateful day, the famous scientist couple Mizuhara were killed in what looked like an accident. Their project, which showed new ways of fighting the virus, descended into the grave with them. Their two children were separated and for a long time were unaware of their origins. But the wheels of destiny keep spinning, as the young Mizuhara is about to discover the truth about his parents, and perhaps bring new hope to humanity...</p>\n<p><em>Pandora no Mori</em> is seemingly unrelated story-wise to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=gaogao+radical\"> first GaoGao game</a>; however, as the story advances, common themes and even recurring characters become apparent. From the point of view of gameplay, <em>Pandora no Mori</em> plays just like its predecessor: it is a Japanese adventure without puzzles, with traditional menu commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", etc.) and object sub-menus. As the first game, it contains scenes with adult content.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Wild Force</em> is set in the same post-apocalyptic world as the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=gaogao+pandora\"> previous entry</a> in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=gaogao\"> GaoGao series</a>. A virus turned most of the Earth's population into mutants, and human beings continued living in artificial cities, separated from the rest of the world. This time, the story is seen from the point of view of the mutants themselves (the previous <em>GaoGao</em> games had human protagonists). These look more like fairy tale creatures (half-cats, winged people, etc.), and continue living on the wild, dangerous Earth, keeping close to their respective animal tribes. The protagonist of the game is a young boy named Wolf, who belongs - you've guessed it - to the wolf tribe. One day, exploring the wilderness, he stumbles upon a strange cave with lurking monsters. Together with a girl from the rabbit tribe and other fantasy creatures, Wolf discovers an advanced civilization, learn of the existence of human beings, and eventually becomes a hero who saves the new world from a grave danger.</p>\n<p>Gameplay-wise, <em>Wild Force</em> is identical to the previous <em>GaoGao</em> games. The player chooses verb commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", \"Ask\", \"Move\", etc.) to read text descriptions, advance the events, and be taken to the next location. As the other games in the series, this is an adult game with nudity and sexual situations - this time dedicated entirely to the \"animal girl fetish\".</p>",

In the future, a failed biological experiment caused widespread mutations, leading to a total separation of human civilization and the mutated tribes of \"animal people\". The events of the game begin shortly after the end of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=gaogao+wild\"> previous installment</a>. Human civilization is nearly destroyed; the remaining humans live in shelters, dreaming of the \"promised land\" Canaan, somewhere \"near the end of the world\", where there is enough food for everyone and where mutants can't enter. The game has two protagonists: a human boy who has lost his parents and who swears to himself to find Canaan, and Wolf, the mutant hero of the previous game, with his colorful female companions. Eventually their paths cross - but will they able to understand each other and bring peace to the troublesome world?..</p>\n<p>The game plays similarly to the other <em>GaoGao</em> entries: the player interacts with the environment by selecting verb commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", \"Move\", etc.). The interaction has been somewhat simplified compared to the previous games, with less object sub-menus and more automatized progression, almost (but not quite) to the point of becoming a visual novel. As in the other <em>GaoGao</em> games, there are scenes with nudity and sexual situations, featuring both \"animal fetish\" and human ladies.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The fourth game in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=ginga+eiyuu+densetsu\"> series</a> based on the anime adaptation of Yoshiki Tanaka's <em>Legend of the Galactic Heroes</em> science fiction novels. The novels (and the games) are set in a futuristic world, where humanity has conquered the entire Milky Way and split into two powerful warring states, each encompassing different systems and planets: the Galactic Empire (modeled after Bismark's 19th century Prussia), and the democratic Free Planets Alliance. </p>\n<p><em>Ginga Eiy\u016b Densetsu IV</em> follows the model used in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/47780/ginga-eiyu-densetsu-iii/\"> third game</a>, rather the pure combat-oriented gameplay of the first two. It expands and refines the gameplay elements that were first introduced in its predecessor. The player chooses the main \"playable character\", i.e. the commander of the entire army (Imperial or Alliance) from a list of generals. Financial management is more in-depth; including budget-planning, funds management, salaries, etc. Sending space ships to conquer and defend planets is done the same way as in the previous game. In fact, the preparations turn into the core of the gameplay, and it is possible to disable the actual combat phases.</p>\n<p>If it is enabled, the combat evolves in a fashion similar to the previous games: the player engages enemy ships in turn-based fashion, and combat is shown as animated scenes. There are more ship types with unique names and abilities, as well as massive attacks that can be performed by the forces stationed on the planet.</p>",

The game consists of three unrelated stories, all of which can be played directly from the main menu:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The first story is a rather mundane tale of a boy and a girl who meet outside and head to the girl's apartment; thanks to the hero's irresistible charm (with a bit of help from alcoholic beverages), the two are able to engage in a variety of sexual acts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The protagonist of the second story is an aspiring journalist, who is given the task to interview a famous female movie star. The interview begins with taking pictures of the celebrity wearing different costumes, and ends with her removing those costumes and performing activities which turn into a blockbuster porn movie.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The third story is dedicated to the obligatory \"little girl\", a female high-school student. There are two possible scenarios, both involving seduction of the poor girl: one involves a sexy female teacher, the other an older male schoolmate.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The gameplay is identical in all three scenarios, and is that of a visual novel combined with some point-and-click activities. The player first chooses the correct approaches to win the favors of the female counterparts, while the more physical part of the seduction involves clicking on various parts of the partner's body in order to trigger the next scene.</p>",

        "description": "<p>What does the story of this game have to do with Shakespeare's famous masterpiece? Absolutely nothing. The word \"hamlet\" is used here in its original meaning, \"little village\". This was the (somewhat ironic) name that was given to a massive project, which started in the 1980-ies yet was first accomplished in the second decade of the 21th century: a research laboratory built on the surface of the Moon. By the middle of the century, Hamlet become one of the most important industrial centers in the world. It manufactured food, medicine, vehicles, and above all - high-technology weapons. Until one day, the contact between the Earth and Hamlet was broken. Suddenly, Hamlet was cut from the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>The owners of the station send a team of six highly trained agents, piloting advanced giant robots (\"mechs\"), led by Conrad V. Eibol (codename \"Boss\"). The mission: enter Hamlet's facilities and find out what happened. When the heroes arrive, they find the first level completely abandoned... except a few mechanisms which have seemingly gone berserk. The youngest of the team, simply addressed as \"Kid\", is sent to explore the lower level, maintaining communication with the others over the radio.</p>\n<p><em>Hamlet</em> is a first-person perspective game, set in the huge 3D maze-like eponymous facility. The auto-map is always visible, showing the player the character's position. Enemies and important objects are also visible on the radar. Whenever an enemy approaches, the playable robot is unable to move. The shooting is actually done in turn-based style; the player can only shoot once the robot's attack meter has filled up, and the rate of shooting depends on the robot's (or enemy's) agility. However, the game doesn't pause when the shooting occurs, creating the illusion of real-time combat.</p>\n<p>Though the game looks like a first-person shooter, it is, in its core, an RPG. Player-controlled robot receives experience and levels up after having defeated certain amounts of enemies. Attack, defense, speed, etc. get increased with each level up. It is possible to find and equip various kinds of weapons: a basic gun with infinite ammo, but low damage; powerful rocket launchers which cause high damage, yet have limited ammunition, etc. Two weapons can be equipped in each hand, and the player can switch between them during combat. Shields can also be found and equipped. Weapon energy, body (\"health\"), and shield energy can be restored with appropriate items.</p>\n<p>An updated version of the game (with enhanced graphics and view angles) was later released in The West under the name <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/25298/space-griffon-vf-9/\"> Space Griffon VF-9</a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>H.H.G.</em> is set in a futuristic world, in which humans co-exists with androids, highly advanced cybernetic organisms. However, this co-existence is anything but peaceful, since androids are going rampant, and a special police force known as ACP (\"Anti Criminal-cyborg Police\") is specifically assigned to deal with them. Two young and lovely police officers, Angelica and Apple, receive a S.O.S. signal from two army pilots, who were attacked by a mysterious female cyborg who called herself Patricia von Kreuzel. Upon arriving at the crime scene, the heroines find no survivors. Together with their colleague, a young detective named Keith, they must investigate and solve this case.</p>\n<p>Despite the title, the game focuses on the depiction of the futuristic world and detective/mystery narrative much more than on display of attractive young women. The game focuses on text and story-related information rather than interaction; whenever it is possible to interact with the environment, the player (controlling Keith) is usually confined to one screen. Clicking on various objects/people on the screen calls forth a menu with verb commands, but usually only one or two are present (\"Examine\" or \"Talk\"). Examining all or most of the objects triggers the advancement of the story.</p>",

He and his new wife have departed on a honeymoon; while he is waiting for them to come home, Shunsuke discovers that he doesn't live alone any more: three young sisters of his stepmother have moved in. Shunsuke now tries to get to know them better (in every possible way..), at the same time gradually discovering dark secrets about his father's intimate life.</p>\n<p><em>Hiiro no Shimai</em> (\"Scarlet Sisters\") can be considered a Japanese-style adventure game, since every screen is accompanied by omnipresent, fixed verb commands: Look, Talk, or Move. Sometimes, one or two more context-specific commands pop out. The game is set entirely in the house, and most of it is spent going to different places (girls' bedrooms, living room, etc.), triggering encounters and advancing the plot. The very limited interaction (no object sub-menus) and the possibility to trigger different scenes by either going to different locations or making choices essentially make this game a visual novel.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Hinadori no Saezuri</em> is a simulation game with touches of strategy. The game is set in a pseudo-historical scenery that resembles the Victorian era in Europe. The player is cast into the role of Foster, a manager of a large mansion. The owner is a young lady named Carol, daughter of the late baron who was successfully running a brothel in it, until it was burnt down. Now the house is rebuilt, and the business can start again. Carol entrusts Foster with teaching and managing the work of the maids, who double as hostesses and prostitutes. What is meant by \"teaching\" is actually training in all things related to sex. </p>\n<p>The training parts are presented as a mini-strategy card game. The player is dealt a hand of cars, which must be combined in such a way that the resulting \"attack\" will have a balanced effect on the parameters of the maid in question. The cards are named after various sexual practices or related issues; \"licking\", \"biting\", \"liquor\", \"rope\" and many other cards are used for various effects.</p>\n<p>Outside of the card game, the player is presented with the protagonist's day-by-day schedule. Every day, the protagonist enquires the main maid about the progress of his training, and assigns work to the maid. Much of this work involves sexual services to guests as well as to the hero himself; however, more regular activities such as cleaning or serving tea can also be regulated. The hero's \"level\" increases depending on the success of his training, and so is the income he receives from the customers.</p>\n<p>Beside those activities, it is also possible to explore the city in which the mansion is situation, visiting various locations such as bar, restaurants, train station, etc. Navigation is done via a menu, and all the locations consist of still pictures. Conversations and events might occur when roaming the city. </p>\n<p>Depending on the locations the player chooses to visit, and then overall training level of his subordinates, it becomes possible to have a romantic affair with a maid. This leads to additional scenes which are unique to each character, and eventually to different endings to the game.</p>",

Several years ago, when he was too young and not considerate enough, he convinced a girl named Reiko to play strip mahjong with him. Later the hero understood that what he did was wrong; Reiko was just a child back then. His atonement was perhaps a bit strange; he traveled to China, and studied there the game of mahjong. So now he is back, and he is determined to invite the now fully-grown Reiko (and other pretty girls in the town) to... more strip mahjong games!</p>\n<p>The game unfolds pretty much the way you'd expect from a strip mahjong game: the player must beat the girls in mahjong, one by one. Each time a girl loses, she removes an article of her clothes. Once she is completely defeated/naked, the hero automatically moves on to the next match.</p>",

A powerful demonic warrior decides it's time to show the human who the bosses are... by having sex with young pretty girls in uniforms, of course!</p>\n<p>The game is a very straight-forward, low-interaction collection of sexual scenes. Controlling the demonic lord, the player can choose which of the \"uniformed\" girls (school girl, police officer, nurse) is to be the first victim. The player can also choose the gender of the transformed demon, which naturally leads to different scenes.

        "description": "<p>Kenta is an ordinary Japanese teenager who enjoys his high school life. One day, he receives an anonymous letter, apparently from a girl, who says she likes him, and wants to meet him in an abandoned school building. However, upon arriving there, he finds that several of his classmates and teachers (mostly female) are there as well. When Kenta realizes they were lured there, it is already too late - they are locked in the building, unable to get out. Kenta must find a way to save his friends... but what if he can't save them all?..</p>\n<p>Though a Japanese game, <em>Isaku</em> is a point-and-click adventure with inventory and puzzles, resembling Western adventures more than its compatriots gameplay-wise. The game is viewed from first-person perspective; while individual locations are presented as still images, the connecting corridors are done in pseudo-3D and can be physically navigated. </p>\n<p>Objects (and people) that can be interacted with are highlighted, offering one or more actions to perform. The gameplay mostly involves exploring the rooms and collecting the necessary information or items to unlock new areas. </p>\n<p>The player is also able to make decisions during the gameplay concerning Kenta's relationship with the various female characters. Depending on these decisions, Kenta will be able to become romantically involved with a girl of the player's choice.</p>\n<p>The adult scenes in the game are very rare and occur only during the ending sequence, or in case Kenta allows one of the girls to be directly captured by the evil mastermind behind their imprisonment.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The follower-up to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=erotic+baka+novel+denwa\"> first Erotic Baka Novel game</a> is similar to it in structure: it is a visual novel with multiple story lines, which take place according to the decisions made by the player during the game. The protagonist is once again a regular Japanese male; this time, the initial \"trigger event\" is a message on his pager. Three different choices regarding his reaction to the beeper's sound lead to three very different story arcs, each involving its own sub-branches. </p>\n<p>Compared to the first game, <em>Itsuka Dokoka de</em> offers significantly fewer choices, and they occur more seldom. The \"choice-consequence\" mechanism is therefore simpler and more transparent in this sequel. The variety of events from the first game is also reduced, the second game focusing more exclusively on encounters of a sexual nature with various women.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A terrorist organization known as Slave Dog poses a threat to the entire world. Steel Fox is the name of an all-female special squad, highly trained in counter-terrorist combat. Assisting them is the independent, state-unbound corporation Neo Logic, which produces assault suits -basically giant robots with their own heavy weaponry, which can be navigated by a skillful pilot. The young female pilot Rei from the Steel Fox is sent on a decisive mission, codenamed \"Night Slave\" - an assault on the terrorist base.</p>\n<p><em>Night Slave</em> is a side-scrolling action game, influenced in setting and gameplay by the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Assault+Suits\">Assault Suits</a> series. The player controls Rei in an armored robot, navigating her through hostile areas. The gameplay is heavy on shooting, the stages consisting mostly on fighting one's way through a level, fighting powerful enemies, mini-bosses and stage bosses.</p>\n<p>The player finds power-ups of different categories. Some can restore Rei's health, protect her robot with a shield, etc.; others are used to upgrade main and secondary weapons. Weapons can \"level up\", depending on how many power-ups were spend to upgrade them. The player can choose when and how to spend the power-ups. Weapons are selected before the beginning of each mission.</p>\n<p>Extensive cutscenes and dialogues move the story forward between the missions of <em>Night Slave</em>. Some of the scenes feature explicit nudity and sexual situations.</p>",

As in most Japanese adventures, the interaction is done via verb commands selected from the menu. The player clicks on an object, which bring up the menu with the commands. However, while there are still no real puzzles, the challenge lies in completing certain actions in time, in order to avoid time paradoxes while staying in the past. The player must explore thoroughly the rooms of the four girls and figure out a way to conquer them.</p>",

Now Ryoko trains to become the best martial artist, taking on the best fighters in the country...</p>\n<p><em>Kakut\u014d Musume Ryoko</em> is structured like a fighting game, but in reality it is primarily a turn-based card game. The game has two modes, Story and Exhibition. The story mode allows the player to control Ryoko between the cut scenes, fighting female opponents as dictated by the story. The exhibition mode allows the player to fight controlling any of the characters that appear in the story mode.</p>\n<p>The fights are always one-on-one. The player is dealt a deck of five cards, each representing a certain fighting move (attack, defense, heal, etc.). cards of the same type can be used in an accumulative way, increasing their effect. Attack moves also require the player to stop a rotating list of moves to select a specific move. Winning two rounds leads to victory and continuation of the story.</p>\n<p>Between the fights, the actual protagonist of the game (Ryoko's male manager) usually has sex with the defeated girls. The sex scenes are built like a mini-game, in which the player is required to reach a girl's \"pleasure bar\" by repeatedly tapping a button (or clicking the mouse). However, too intense tapping might result in the protagonist's premature ejaculation, forcing the player to replay the whole scene.</p>",

After she has been introduced to her duties at the new place, Kanako decides to get to know the employees better, and in process learns their most intimate secrets...</p>\n<p>The game is a rather standard Japanese-style adventure; the interface consists of a menu with verb commands (\"Examine\", \"Talk\", etc.), which usually lead to sub-menus of objects or conversation topics. Navigation is also done via an appropriate menu command.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the anime series <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tekkaman+Blade\"> Tekkaman Blade</a>. In the year 2087, the Earth is attacked by an alien race known as Radam. Assisting the army of aliens are Tekkamen, powerful armored creatures who turn out to be humans brainwashed by the Radam to further their military causes. Blade is the nickname of one of these Tekkamen, the only one who is able to withstand the brainwashing and help the humans to avert the alien menace.</p>\n<p>This interpretation of the anime is a real-time strategy game (RTS). Most of the game consists of large-scale battles between the army led by Blade and the aliens or enemy Tekkamen. The player most order his troops to move, attack, and employ various strategies in real time. Player-controlled army includes plot-related characters (such as Blade himself), as well as \"nameless\" human troops and robots. Once one of the player-controlled characters is in the proximity of an enemy unit, a semi-automatic battle sequence ensues. During these battles, the player is only able to choose special attacks (if any) for the character in question, or retreat. Otherwise, the character and the enemy will exchange attacks according to their parameters.</p>\n<p>Victory conditions vary from mission to mission, but mostly involve defending a certain position or eliminating all enemy troops. Cut scenes between the missions advance the story.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Three hundred years ago, a great war consumed the world. It is said that people were using devastating magical spells against each other. But years have passed, and the knowledge of magic was forgotten. Legend persists that somewhere there is the Book of Magic, the greatest treasure anyone could dream of. The legend captivated Nash, a young careless thief who decides to ignore the obvious danger and ventures to the borders of the kingdom in search of the treasure. Naturally, he encounters evil forces who won't let him reach his goal; and that's how the thief turns into a hero who will eventually save the world...</p>\n<p><em>Sorcer Kingdom</em> (no relation to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/14077/sorcerers-kingdom/\"> similarly named</a> Genesis/MegaDrive game) can be described as a \"pseudo-RPG\". The premise and the structure of the game (top-down navigation, vast dungeon-like areas, towns, etc.) imply role-playing elements; however, these are too light to consider the game a \"true\" RPG. Rather, it contains exploration segments and dialogue alongside action-based battles. The battles aren't very frequent, and can even be set on auto; they are confined to a small area and are triggered whenever an enemy is near the hero. There are no experience points, equipment, or comparable RPG system. The game contains a few scenes with explicit nudity and sexual situations.</p>",

One night, the current dragon sorceress, a girl named Setsuna, was attacked by a horrifying monster. Her sword dancer, Hien, tried to save her; but the monster was stronger and flew away with the girl. The young hero swears to bring her back, restoring his honor and the peace in his country.</p>\n<p><em>Sword Dancer</em> has top-down navigation, linear story progression, automatic leveling up, and randomly appearing enemies, which effectively makes it a Japanese-style RPG; however, unlike in most other games of the genre, the battles here aren't turn-based. Taking place on small side-scrolling areas, the battles switch to action gameplay, with the hero being able to jump, duck, and execute different kinds of attacks.</p>\n<p>Various characters will join the party, but the player can only control one at a time. Any character can be chosen to be the lead of the party, and hence the active character in battles.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Goddess of the Evil Blade</em> is a direct sequel to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/49998/sword-dancer/\"> first Sword Dancer</a>. The story continues to chronicle the adventures of the \"sword dancer\" Hien and his mentor, the warrior Tetsuta. They have succeeded in rescuing the \"white dragon sorceress\" Setsuna from the clutches of the demons. However, greater challenges await the three. Setsuna's life might be in danger, and the watchful eye of the evil Black Dragon continues to follow the heroes. The adherents of the benevolent White Dragon have to prepare for the decisive battle against the forces of evil...</p>\n<p>The game plays very similarly to its predecessor. The overall structure corresponds to that of a traditional Japanese RPG: the player navigates the heroes through top-down environments, buying supplies in town, advancing the narrative in a linear way, and fighting enemies to gain experience and level up automatically. Like in the first game, the battles are action sequences that take place in small side-scrolling areas, similarly to fighting games. However, unlike in the predecessor, the enemies are visibly walking on the screen.</p>\n<p>The fighting game element is more developed in the second game; two additional modes (beside the main story mode) are accessible from the main menu: \"monster attack\" and \"vs. mode\". Monster attack mode allows the player to select one of the game's heroes and fight increasingly stronger monsters; \"vs. mode\" features two-player competition.</p>",

Its inhabitants make wine from the country's fine grapes, and merchants from all over the world travel there. But the era of piece has come to an end. An evil force that was asleep for thousand years has awakened. Ferocious monsters and terrible disease plague the kingdom. One day, a Wineslem girl named Elphie finds an unconscious young man on the lake shore. He doesn't remember anything about his past.

However, the combat requires the player to actively press the \"attack\" key (unlike the \"bumping\" combat in <em>Ys</em>). Defeated monsters bring experience points, which contribute to the hero's automatic leveling up. Beside physical attacks, the hero can also execute special techniques which require \"psyche\" points.</p>",

The protagonist is one of the brothers, who wants to \"prove himself\" to the other one by kidnapping a young girl and turning her into his sex slave. </p>\n<p>The general gameplay is a simplified version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Princess+Maker\"> Princess Maker</a>: the player manages a schedule of the victim, which mainly consists of sexual \"training\" (various sexual activities), as well as more \"mundane\" tasks as housework. Depending on the player's choices, the parameters of the girl change. The protagonist can also challenge his brother to combat; the outcome of the automatic battle depends on the results achieved when \"raising\" the sex slave.</p>",

Basically, the player is cast as one of Satan's minions, who also happens to be the new \"punishment teacher\" in the Sparta High School. As the protagonist arrives at the school, he quickly attends to his \"duties\". However, the sadist's efforts are thwarted by a mysterious, masked, completely naked woman. The player's job is to make sure this won't happen again - which means defeating the super-heroine, and continuing to torture young girls...</p>\n<p><em>Kekk\u014d Kamen</em> has elements of adventure and simulation. The player navigates the \"hero\" through top-down school grounds. Items (mostly instruments of torture) can be collected. When the protagonist is able to capture a victim, he proceeds to torture her; the player is then presented with a point-and-click interface. From time to time, turn-based battles will ensue; however, they are built more like dialogue choices rather than real RPG or strategic fights: the player has to find the right combination of various attacks and the adversary's body parts in order to inflict damage. The simulation element is evident in the detailed torture interaction and in the game's keeping track of the protagonist's \"advancements\" with his victims and opponents.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the sequel to to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Kekk%C5%8D+Kamen\"> first Kekk\u014d Kamen</a>, the player is no longer required to control the satanic protagonist of the previous game. Instead, the protagonist is a young substitute teacher (default name Ryusuke) who is perplexed at his discoveries in the high school he is invited to work for. As the title implies (<em>shioki</em> means \"corporal punishment\"), some teachers and students engage in bizarre sadistic activities. It's up to the player to decide how the new guy will fit in.</p>\n<p>This sequel plays more like a traditional Japanese first-person adventure, with still screens, plenty of text, and a basic verb-object interface (\"Look\", \"Think\", \"Move\", etc.). Unlike the first game, the protagonist is not inherently evil here. It is possible to make choices and decide whether he should save the victims or join the torturers. The game keeps track of the hero's alignment, from \"demonic\" to \"angelic\" and anything in between.</p>",

Ramy's default weapon is a short sword; she can execute dash attacks which damage the enemy but increase her vulnerability. Ramy can also jump (albeit rather slowly) to access higher platforms and avoid attacks. Bombs can be set in order to trap the enemies. The bunny-girl's health is measured (logically) by carrots; eating said vegetable or other food dropped by the enemies increases a unit of her hit points.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A scientist named Zen Shiratori was investigating the ruins of an ancient Mayan temple, convinced that the proof of the existence of a parallel world lies there. He found a strange glowing orb, which was later accidentally discover by his fourteen-year-old son Gen, who was rummaging through Dad's collection. As a result, Gen was indeed teleported into a parallel world. There, he meets a young girl named Rinna, who tells him that he is, in fact, \"Gen-Kaiser\", the much-expected savior of their world. Piloting giant combat robots, the two must protect the innocents of that world and defeat evil.</p>\n<p><em>Kis\u014d Shinden: Gen-Kaiser</em> is a turn-based strategy/RPG hybrid (what is commonly called in Japan a \"tactical RPG\"). There is overworld navigation, and the player can also visit and explore cities; however, these features are rather rudimentary, and hostile areas cannot be explored in real time and are presented as large-scale strategic battles. The characters move in turns over the top-down battlefield and attack when enemies are in range. Animations are displayed for each attack, and experience points are awarded for successful elimination of an enemy.</p>",

However, fate intervened and arranged a bike accident, which resulted in a meeting with a creature from another world - a cute fox-girl named Sharan. She needs nothing else but to be together with the hero; but a mysterious voice tells him: \"one wish has been fulfilled, two more to go\"...</p>\n<p><em>Oh! Kitsune-sama</em> can be considered a visual novel. Though there are instances with the typical \"Look/Talk/Think\" interaction, it is very limited, there are no sub-menus with objects, every choice is context-related, and the game can be advanced simply by going through all the choices.

Following the death of his father, he stays in the house of one of his female cousins, with other members of the family also being there. That night, Koichi sees a particularly violent dream, in which he succumbs to his inexplicable beastly instincts and brutally murders a young girl. But the next day her finds out that a girl has really been murdered at exactly the same spot he saw in his nightmare...</p>\n<p><em>Kizuato</em> is an adult, predominantly horror-themed visual novel. Most of the game consists of textual descriptions and conversations superimposed on background graphics and still portraits. The gameplay is limited to occasional choices, which might trigger different scenes. The game uses standard anime-style graphics for the characters, but the backgrounds have a more photorealistic look, mostly in black-white or sepia tones.</p>",

The four girls are still there - grown up, looking differently, but still remembering him. But each one of them has a secret, which requires the hero to enter the realm of the supernatural - and perhaps find his true love...</p>\n<p><em>Mystic Princess</em> has elements of a \"regular\" Japanese-style adventure (interaction possibilities in form of menu-based verb-object combinations), as well as a visual novel (decision-making, different endings). There are also a few places with \"pseudo-RPG\" turn-based combat, though the main bulk of the game is still dedicated to reading text and \"triggering\" the narrative.

        "description": "<p>The game's protagonist is a young man named Okita. His friend Murakami has recently found a part-time job: housework in the Kuroneko (\"Black Cat\") mansion, which belongs to a rich and mysterious family. However, since then, Okita hasn't received a word from his friend. Worried about this strange silence, Okita travels to the mansion. There, he finds out that Murakami has left. He decides to stay and investigate the suspicious circumstances. But he is not prepared to the assault of wild eroticism that the mansion's inhabitants will soon unleash on him...</p>\n<p><em>Kuroneko-kan</em> plays mostly like a visual novel, albeit with more choice prompts than it is usually the case in comparable games. The player is sometimes able to choose a location to visit; many other instances require him to choose the correct action and/or answer in order to view an additional scene, or avoid premature death.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>46 Okunen Monogatari: The Shinkaron</em> (which translates to \"The Story of 4,600,000,000 Years: The Evolution Theory\") is an unusual role-playing game that puts the player in control of an evolving creature. The playable character is a fish at the beginning of the game; after completing the \"fish stage\", it becomes a reptile, and so on, until the highest stages of evolution are reached. </p>\n<p>Despite this premise, the game retains elements of a \"regular\" story-driven RPG, with an overarching narrative (the player character is a creature chosen by the goddess Gaia to evolve and protect the Earth), and quest-based structure. The animals in the game can talk to each other, it is possible to chat with friendly NPCs, and the game advances once certain quests have been completed.</p>\n<p>The player navigates the heroic creature through (mostly) top-down areas. Hostile creatures are visible roaming the environment. Whenever the player-controlled character touches a hostile creature, a turn-based battle ensues. The battles are viewed from first-person perspective; the player can attack, use special abilities, or flee. Defeating enemies awards \"evolution points\", which can be distributed to increase the playable character's parameters.</p>\n<p>Unlike most Japanese RPGs, <em>46 Okunen Monogatari</em> allows the player to upgrade any of the four main parameters manually, in any order. These parameters are: attack power, defense, intelligence, and endurance (needed to reduce or eliminate damage received from certain terrain types). Once one of these parameters \"levels up\", the player-controlled creature evolves into a different, stronger one. The evolution tree for each animal type is rather small, but non-linear, i.e. the player can bypass certain types depending on how he/she builds the character.</p>\n<p>The game offers exact descriptions of the animals the hero can turn into, and re-creates real prehistoric evolutionary trees.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Long time ago, during the celestial war between the light and the dark heavenly realms, a beautiful goddess statue was sent to promote peace between the realms. However, the dark side used the statue for the opposite purpose. In the end, powerful magic was needed to shatter the statue and finally starting the era of peace. However, the spirit of the goddess is about to be resurrected. Many years later, the young prince Toffeel is dreaming of a present for his birthday, but is sent by his strict father on a mission to exterminate monsters. Soon he becomes involved in the greatest adventure of his life...</p>\n<p><em>Caramel Quest</em> is a traditional Japanese-style RPG with a humorous undertone. The player controls Toffeel and other characters who eventually join the party (up to four). Roaming the top-down world, the heroes fight randomly appearing enemies in first-person perspective, turn-based combat. Characters can also learn and use various magical spells. Some of the dungeons are maze-like and/or contain puzzles to solve.</p>",

A machine that occupies one room can produce an amount of energy that is strong enough even to disrupt time. During the presentation, unforeseen circumstances cause the machine to initiate a time shift, during which the head scientist Stockman and one of his subordinates are teleported to a fantastic world where psyonic powers take the place of technology, and where four different species have co-existed peacefully until the accident. The Dragon Tusk tribe gives shelter to Stockman, but he must undo the time shift, prevent further disasters, and find a way to return to his world...</p>\n<p><em>Different Realm</em> plays like a traditional Japanese turn-based RPG, with party management, world map exploration, top-down view, and automatic leveling up. It also utilizes <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/5130/glodia/\"> Glodia's</a> patented combat system, which they also used in their other RPGs, such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Emerald+Dragon\"> Emerald Dragon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Vain+dream\"> Vain Dream</a>: characters are able to move on the battlefield, and the speed of attack depends on the distance between the controlled character and the enemy.

But when he turns sixteen, he finds out that he was adopted; on a rainy night, he was found outside of the hut. His mother, dying from numerous wounds, gave his adoptive family a sword and a letter which explained that Jin was destined to prevent a resurrection of an evil demon lord once he turned seventeen. Jin leaves his home and embarks on the perilous journey that will shape his destiny...</p>\n<p><em>Another Genesis</em> is a rather simple and very traditional Japanese-style RPG. The player navigates the hero(es) through the top-down world, visiting towns, buying weapons and armor, descending into dungeons, and fighting randomly (though surprisingly infrequently) appearing enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. The game's graphical and gameplay style are heavily influenced by early <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dragon+Quest\"> Dragon Quest</a>, including a similar interaction menu with options such as \"Talk\" and \"Door\".</p>",

        "description": "<p>The story of <em>Pink Shock Pirates</em> is rather simple: the protagonist is a young girl named Pink, who wants to become a pirate. To do so, she acquires a ship (which she calls <em>Shock</em>), and begins to explore the land in search of crew and adventure.</p>\n<p><em>Pink Shock Pirates</em> is a hybrid of strategy and role-playing. Rather than following a linear narrative with scripted events, the game allows the player to sail through the sea and visit towns on all the continents right from the beginning. Towns are represented by small pictures of places of interest, such as weapon shop, item shop, church, etc. Crew members can be hired in towns, or by performing quests. Instead of a usual RPG \"party\", the player manages and controls the crew of an entire ship (their number can get as high as 50). </p>\n<p>Enemy ships will randomly attack <em>Shock</em>. Before the battle, the player has to position all the crew members on the deck. The player can buy and upgrade the ship cannons, as well as other long-ranged weapons that can be used in battles without engaging in melee. These cannons have limited ammunition; if the player hasn't succeeded to scare the enemy ship away or runs out of ammo, the enemy might get aboard <em>Shock</em> and attack the crew. The battles are turn-based and involve the player moving the crew members on the screen, attacking when an enemy is in range. Attacks are graphically represented as animated sequences appearing in small windows. </p>\n<p>Role-playing elements are present in the leveling up of crew members, as well as in the possibility to explore the land on foot. The player navigates Pink over the top-down \"world map\", entering and exploring hostile areas. Enemies will attack randomly; land battles are handled the same way as the melee combat on the sea.</p>\n<p>All the crew members are female, and during combat they might lose parts of their clothes. Despite these suggestive themes, there is no explicit nudity or sexual situations in the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p>After the brave pirate Pink has defeated the evil Temujin in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/51380/pink-shock-pirates/\"> first game</a>, peace was restored in the land of Thanatos. However, demonic forces cannot be annihilated so easily; the spirit of Temujin is still alive, looking for a body to possess once the power of the seal that imprisons his soul is gone. The king of the land is concerned, particularly because Pink herself has disappeared, possibly abducted by Temujin's agents. The king summons four female knights under the command of Sara, and orders them to rescue Pink and stop the forces of evil once again.</p>\n<p><em>Pink Shock Pirates II</em> retains many gameplay elements of the original; however, rather than being a hybrid between two full-fledged genres (strategy and role-playing), it is more of an RPG with strategy elements. Instead of controlling Pink alone and hiring crew members, the player controls a standard RPG party (up to five characters). More gameplay time is now dedicated to exploring the land masses on foot, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based style. Despite the drastically reduced amount of active combatants, the battles still have a strategic edge: the player has to position the five girls on the battle field and navigate them over it, attacking when an enemy is in range. The towns are now viewed from the same top-down view as the rest of the game, and can be physically explored.</p>\n<p>Sea exploration and ship customization is still present in the sequel. It is no longer possible to fight with ship cannons; instead, the player can acquire multiple ships. From time to time, a whole armada of ships will attack the protagonists, which leads to turn-based battles that are played similarly to the regular ones, the combatants being represented as separate ships rather than individual characters. As in the first game, the enemies can decide to board the player-controlled ship; a battle with a larger number of combatants (including \"nameless\" crew members) ensues.</p>",

However, the legend of the Blue Star, a miraculous warrior who would liberate Alantia, continued to live. The last survivor of a powerful race, a young girl named Erina bravely ventures against Ezekiel's forces, in a desperate attempt to fulfill the prophecy.</p>\n<p><em>Alantia</em> is a pseudo-3D scrolling shooter that has certain similarities to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1434/space-harrier/\">Space Harrier</a>. The screen scrolls only if the player character is moving. The heroine shoots energy balls with her staff; in order to shoot, she has to kneel and stop moving.

        "description": "<p><em>Kyarukan: Super Break Down!!</em> is a simple tile-matching puzzle game with an erotic theme. The player is presented with a grid of tiles containing hidden pictures; the goal is to match identically-looking pairs in as few moves as possible, until all the tiles are revealed and the stage is completed. The player is given a certain amount of lives, which can be increased by revealing special tiles (pictures of a girl's face or the words \"life\"), or reduced by hitting a tile with a wolf on it. Other tiles that can't be matched include \"open\" (reveals all the tiles for a brief moment) and \"shuffle\" (changes the location of the pictures).</p>\n<p>Once a stage is completed, the player is presented with an anime-style picture of a young woman. The stages become increasingly complex, with bigger grids and more tile types; the girl gradually removes her clothes after each stage. There are three \"scenarios\" in the game, with three different girls; however, the gameplay remains identical in all of them.</p>",

One day, after talking to a nice-looking boy named Ryosuke, Asuka came home and masturbated in the shower. The next day, she found out that someone has taken photos of her during that intimate moment. From that point on, Asuka becomes involved in a violent chain of events. Will she be able to retain her purity and be together with Ryosuke, or put in danger everyone she cares for and become a willing sex slave?</p>\n<p><em>Ky\u014dhaku</em> is a visual novel; even through the game has a rudimentary command menu (with \"Look\" and \"Talk\" commands), it appears infrequently, and doesn't allow much interaction. The gameplay involves making choices for Asuka, branching the storyline and leading the game towards one of the many possible endings, only few of which can be classified as \"happy\".</p>",

Will Shingo concentrate on his job or succumb to the pleasures of the flesh?</p>\n<p>The game is a very simple, low-interaction Japanese adventure. Every screen has four commands: \"Look\", \"Talk\", \"Move\", and - depending on the context - \"Teach\" or \"Go Home\". Each day is divided into morning and afternoon sections.

        "description": "<p>In the year 1999, humans have discovered an alien technology that allowed them to construct powerful mechs and ships that traveled faster than light. Ten years later, the Zentradi, a race of proxy warriors serving the ancient Protoculture, encountered the humans during an enemy pursuit. Led by the relentless Britai Kridanki, the Zentradi forces initiate a Space War, trying to harness the humans' nuclear technology. </p>\n<p><em>Ch\u014d Jik\u016b Y\u014dsai Macross: Remember Me</em> is based on the anime series <em>Macross</em>. It is a turn-based strategy game in which the player controls an army of space vehicles and mechs operated by humans navigating the giant starship SDF-1 Macross. The game develops linearly, with cutscenes featuring main characters from the anime taking place between and during missions. The player has to outfit Macross with mechs, ships, and weapons before each mission. Afterwards, the player positions the combatants on the battle field. The player then navigates ships and mechs on the screen, engaging enemy craft in combat. Combat sequences proceed automatically, and are displayed as animated sequences.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The year is 2009, and humanity's most powerful weapon is the Super Dimension Fortress One, also known as \"Macross\", an alien starship containing powerful technology. On a fateful day, a fleet of an alien warrior race known as Zentradi was hit by Macross' automatic defense system, inadvertently starting Space War I.</p>\n<p><em>Ch\u014d Jik\u016b Y\u014dsai Macross: Skull Leader</em> is based on the anime series <em>Macross</em>, narrating its initial chapters and focusing on one of its primary characters, Hikaru Ichijyo. Like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/53161/cho-jiku-yosai-macross-remember-me/\">Remember Me</a>, it is a turn-based strategy game; however, it cannot be considered a sequel, since it does not continue the story and has many gameplay-related differences.</p>\n<p>The battles take place on an isometric screen. Instead of deploying individual space ships and mechs, as it was the case in <em>Remember Me</em>, the player positions human commanders, each controlling several of the aforementioned craft. The player can change formations in order to gain advantage in battle. Commanders are navigated on the screen in turn-based fashion. When an enemy is in range, the player has to choose an attack technique to employ against him. The ensuing battle is then displayed on a separate screen, proceeding automatically.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the <em>Macross</em> anime, <em>Ch\u014d Jik\u016b Y\u014dsai Macross: Love Stories</em> is a direct sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/53162/cho-jiku-yosai-macross-skull-leader/\">Skull Leader</a>; the game continues its story, as the humans on board the SDF-1 Macross continue to fight the Zentradi aliens under the command of Britai Kridanik. Visual style and gameplay system are nearly identical to those of the predecessor: the player deploys unit commanders on an isometric battle field and moves them in turn-based fashion, attacking enemies with mechs and space ships controlled by the commanders. </p>\n<p>The sequel features more different human commanders as well as new ship and mech types. The player can choose to play through the main campaign (which includes additional cutscenes and adventure-like menu-based exploration), or directly play any of the three available missions.</p>",

Immediately afterwards, the hero finds himself in a hospital, suffering from amnesia and facing an unknown woman who looks exactly like the puppet. Now he has to find out the truth behind this strange story, and separate dream from reality.</p>\n<p><em>Mirror</em> is a visual novel.

        "description": "<p>A young man named Kenji decides to have a vacation on the beautiful island together with his sister Hiromi. Taking a break from work and worries, the two discover a tourist resort with lovely beaches and high-class hotels. Very soon Kenji finds out that many attractive young women either work on the island or have come there for various reasons. Soon the holiday turns into a never-ending string of sexual escapades - and perhaps one of them will turn into a true romance?</p>\n<p><em>Marine Rouge</em> is a Japanese-style adventure game. The player interacts with the environments by selecting commands, which include Look, Talk, Think, and Move. Object sub-menus appear very rarely; for the most part it is necessary to exhaust all possible choices to complete an event (usually a dialogue) and return to the limited freedom of choosing different locations to visit. Depending on these choices, the game will trigger different scenes, eventually shifting towards different endings.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The kingdom of Franmer lies on the shore of a large sea. One day, a boy from the village of Kos discovered a mysterious ancient stone while diving. The king sends his most renowned specialist to decipher the inscription on the stone. It appears that an evil demon named Gairom has gained possession of sacred orbs that preserve the balance of nature. It is up to the local female warrior Meiria and the magician Faran, daughter of the king's minister, to find a way to retrieve the orbs and defeat Gairom.</p>\n<p><em>Marines: Gairom no F\u016bin</em> is primarily a puzzle game. The player must use Meiria's unique ability to hurl large orbs that can destroy stone structures. However, Meiria can only shoot in a straight line; in order to change the angle of the shot, the player has to manipulate the orb into a whirlwind, which either occurs naturally or can be produced by positioning other characters of the party at correct angles. Characters can also push stones, and use special abilities to help Meiria achieve her goal.</p>\n<p>The game also has light RPG elements. Characters in the party have hit points, and various healing and offensive items can be found during puzzle stages. There are a few dungeons in the game, but they contain no enemies. The few turn-based battles occur as dictated by the plot, and can be won using strategic combinations of physical attacks, magic, and items. There is no leveling system in the game. </p>\n<p>Anime-style cutscenes advance the plot between some of the stages. Some of these cutscenes contain explicit nudity and sexual situations.</p>",

Disregarding the bizarre occurrences accompanying his first impression, Kyosuke agrees to venture into each of the four rooms with colored doors inside the mansion. Each door leads him to a different reality, where he is manifested in different incarnations that allow him to experience various kinds of sexual encounters.</p>\n<p><em>The Masquerade</em> is essentially a visual novel, though with a larger amount of available actions and choices than usually occur in games of this type. One of the stories Kyosuke can access has more pronounced adventure gameplay, with limited menu-based navigation. The others mostly unfold according to choices made by the player. These choices may trigger different scenes or lead to \"bad\" endings.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Many years ago, in imperial Japan, advances in a mysterious science called \"meta-topology\" have led to the unexpected prosperity of the Heian era. A special university was founded by the scientists, where researches in bio- and nano-technology were conducted. Since women dominated society during that time, they were the ones imbued with the powers of meta-topology. A series of conflicts between reactionary governments and the \"meta-women\", as they began calling themselves, continued thousands years into the future. Led by Mayumi Tanaka, president of the astronomy department, a group of young women tries to protect their existence using their remarkable powers.</p>\n<p><em>Metajo</em> is a tactical role-playing game. The game consists of a series of large-scale battles, with cutscenes and dialogues advancing the story. The player controls a group of meta-women, navigating them over top-down battle area. The main characters are controlled by the players, while \"nameless\" units follow AI routines. Individual battles are displayed on separate screens, and are calculated according to the attributes of the participants. Leveling up occurs after having accumulated a sufficient amount of experience points.</p>",

Endowed with special powers, the girls try to protect the integrity of the school against opponents of meta-topology, as well as possible traitors within their own ranks. Gameplay-wise, this chapter is nearly identical to the first one, relying on the same tactical RPG template with melee attacks and special meta-topology powers.

But soon rogue organizations collectively known as space pirates began to terrorize space stations. This led to a series of violent conflicts. Both sides developed various types of giant mechs operated by human pilots, called \"Metal Movers\". A special police force was founded to combat the pirates. The young pilot Gingie and his lovely companion Windy must defend the space station and eventually venture into enemy territory.</p>\n<p><em>Metal Mover Jastrike</em> is a top-down shooter. The player navigates a mech through maze-like hostile areas, fighting enemies on the way. Enemies respawn whenever the protagonist re-enters a screen. The mech possesses a basic melee weapon, mid-range laser attack, as well as powerful missile and grenade launchers with limited ammunition. Defeated enemies sometimes drop power-ups which may increase the player character's hit points or shields, eliminate all enemies on screen, etc. Anime-style cutscenes advance the plot between missions. Some of them contain explicit nudity and erotic themes.</p>",

The interaction consists of selection of context-specific commands (which usually include \"Look\" and \"Talk\"); typically, most or all options have to be depleted before the player can move to the next section of the game.</p>",

As a result, human history began changing itself. In order to put an end to this, a special group called Misty Flash was assembled. Consisting of three young and attractive women - Mai, Yuri, and Miki - the group travels to different time periods, locates criminals, but also liberally enjoys the pleasures of flesh.</p>\n<p><em>Misty Flash</em> is a hybrid of Japanese-style adventure and card-based battles. Short adventure segments feature traditional menu-based interface; typically, the player has to exhaust all options before the next event is triggered. Confrontations against female criminals take the shape of turn-based battles. The player is dealt a deck of cards representing normal attacks, special attacks, healing, as well as buffing up attack power and defense. In addition, each card has a number from 1 to 9; the higher this number is, the stronger is the effect of the card. Battles end with interactive, menu-based lesbian sex scenes.</p>",

The protagonist, a young man named Shinnosuke, discovers a beautiful mansion, in which apparently a large-scale party is taking place. Determined to meet and enchant some beautiful women, he ventures into the mansion. The rest of the story develops according to the decisions made by the player, which are restricted to choosing one of the several available locations within the mansion, and dialogue prompts during conversations with young women. Depending on these choices, the player will have the opportunity to uncover various scenes involving these women, which eventually lead to sexual intercourse between them and the protagonist. Subsequent plot events and the ending depend on the exact way the player has pursued these relationships.</p>",

The moment came when the Federation became weakened after the Gryps War.

The seemingly never-ending war between the Federation and Zeon has entered a new phase.</p>\n<p><em>Return of Zion</em> is a strategy game based on the anime franchise <em>Gundam</em>. The player controls the forces of the Earth Federation. The game is mission-based; each mission is shaped as a tactical turn-based battle that takes place on a defined map. The player can choose unit types and formations, position them on the map, and then engage in battle against the opposing force. Units may consist of infantry mechas, tanks, and other kinds of machines. One-on-one battles take place on a separate screen, and are actively controlled by the player, who is able to choose the type of weapon to use or retreat from the battle.</p>",

After a change of leadership, Republic of Zeon became the Principality of Zeon, a despotic, militarized state with a visible intention to achieve independence by any means. Soon the conflict evolved into the deadliest event humanity has ever known - the One Year War.</p>\n<p><em>A Year of War</em> is a strategy game similar to Family Soft's earlier <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/54028/mobile-suit-gundam-return-of-zion/\">Return of Zion</a>, though from the point of view of <em>Gundam</em> chronology, it is a distant prequel. The gameplay is nearly identical to that of its predecessor: the player navigates units (mostly mecha pilots) in turn-based fashion over the battle field, attacking enemies when they are in the range of the unit's weapons. Like in the previous game, the one-on-one battles are active, the player being able to choose between several kinds of weapons or retreat. In-battle dialogue and cutscenes advance the plot of the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The events of <em>Stardust Operation</em> takes place in UC (Universal Century) 0083, four years after the devastating One Year War between the Earth federation and the Principality of Zeon. Even though the latter lost the war, rogue organizations affiliated with it continue to pose a threat to the Federation. One of their plans involves dropping a space colony onto the Earth, to damage its food supply. The war has ended, but the hostilities are far from being extinguished.</p>\n<p><em>Stardust Operation</em> is a strategy game based on the events of the anime <em>Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory</em>. The player takes control of either Federation or Zeon forces, playing through two independent scenarios that evolve linearly, from mission to mission. Each mission is shaped like a tactical battle, during which the player navigates units (mostly mechas) over the battle field in turn-based fashion. Unlike in Family Soft's previous <em>Gundam</em> strategy games, one-on-one battles are automatic; the player chooses the weapon to use in the attack before it initiates. Missions usually involve specific goals, and are interspersed by dialogue and cutscenes.</p>",

Like its predecessor, it simulates survival of a group of people on a deserted island - this time, following a ship accident. The basic gameplay is very similar to that of the previous game. The player has to make schedules for the survivors, sending teams to procure necessary supplies such as water, food, light sources, building materials, etc. Only a small part of the island is accessible in the beginning: the player gradually explores it by arranging expeditions. It is possible to manage up to three parties of people, giving each an assignment, which unfolds automatically as the player chooses to complete a day. The survivors' attributes will change depending on the activities chosen by the player.</p>\n<p>The game is significantly more story-driven than the first installment. Each of the survivors has his or her own personality, attributes, and unique dialogue lines. Team members will comment on the occurrences, depending on the party formation the player chooses.</p>",

However, its setting is quite different: rather than getting stranded on a deserted tropical island, the protagonist travels in subway when a terrible earthquake occurs. Climbing out of the underground tunnels, the hero discovers, to his horror, that Tokyo has been nearly destroyed and deserted. Teaming up with other survivors, the protagonist has to explore the ruins and stay alive.</p>\n<p>The basic gameplay is similar to that of the two predecessors: the player manages parties of survivors, assigning activities to them (exploring, resting, finding items, etc.), then completing the day and watching these events unfold automatically. Water, food, light, and various materials can be found and collected. It is also possible to craft own items. Scripted events introduce new characters to the team. Hostile encounters may also occur; the player can either choose to fight, retreat, or deal with the potential enemies. There is no active control of the characters during battles.</p>",

Criminals have found ways to hide within the computer system, and corrupt it through their digital manifestations. The player takes the role of a Net Guardian, an angelic-looking creature equipped with destructive weaponry with the goal of wiping out the criminals. The game's environments switch from abstract computer nodes to anime imagery, sometimes parodying popular video games (for example, one of the levels has scenery and enemies reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dragon+Quest\">Dragon Quest</a> games). The player can collect power-ups that enhance the current weapon, and also switch between different weapon types. Each stages culminates with a boss battle.</p>",

The player controls a fighter spacecraft, advancing through five large levels swarming with enemies (space ships, turrets, tanks, etc.), each culminating with a boss battle. The spacecraft is armed with primary and secondary weapons (fired simultaneously), as well as powerful bomb attacks. Each of these comes in three varieties distinguished by color: red, yellow, and purple. The red group of weapons focuses on spraying fire in different directions; the yellow group contains powerful weapons without covering much of the screen; the purple group is composed of homing lasers and missiles. Power-ups usually stay on screen for a while, changing their color properties.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Night Gunner</em> is a futuristic shooter completely different from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/19121/night-gunner/\">ZX Spectrum</a> game of the same name. In the future, Earth is under alien invasion, and the player takes the role of its last defender, fending off alien spacecraft. The game is viewed from a first-person perspective; the player can move the aim of the gun, but is otherwise stationary. The goal is to destroy incoming enemy ships by using either beam or more powerful bomb attacks. The gun's energy gradually refills between shots, so it is important to plan ahead and have enough energy for harder battles.</p>",

The two heroes must unveil the mystery before their antagonists do.</p>\n<p><em>Nooch III: Saigo no Seisen</em> is the third entry of the Nooch series, and a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/54114/nooch-ii-revenge-of-remy/\">Nooch II: Revenge of Remy</a>.

The player can choose to play in the training mode, alternating between five courses of various difficulty, and setting the strike limit. The versus mode allows the player to choose one of the many available female opponents of different appearances and professions (e.g. a schoolgirl, a teacher, a nurse, etc.). The game is played from first-person perspective; the player must stop a moving bar at the right time to regulate the strength of the shot and its angle. Having a lower score after four holes makes the opponent undress and assume an erotic pose.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Daisenryaku II</em> is the second main installment in the turn-based war strategy series. Like its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/47223/gendai-daisenryaku/\">predecessor</a>, the game puts the player in the role of a commander of an army that must defeat an opposing force on a given map within a certain amount of turns. The player has to manage unit production, deliver supply vehicles, and navigate infantry, tanks, aircraft and ships on a hex-based grid map, trying to conquer the opponent's cities and strategic locations.</p>\n<p>The main new feature of this installment is the introduction of two additional possible belligerents (\"green\" and \"yellow\"), along with the old \"blue\" and \"red\". Any of the four sides can be assigned to be controlled by either a human player or the computer AI. Many of the maps may feature only two or three sides, but some offer a full-scale war between four armies. A few maps are based on real geographical areas (e.g. Italy), or may allude to a historical conflict, such as the conquests of the Roman Empire; weapons and vehicles, however, are always modern.</p>",

The gameplay system remains mostly unchanged compared to the second installment; differences mostly involve larger maps, interface tweaks, different degrees of zooming, etc.</p>",

The plot involves Tomo meeting her friends Erika and Miki, only to become trapped in a magical dimension with her friends gone. Tomo must travel to various worlds in order to find them; these worlds have varied themes and settings, including an alien attack on a spaceship, a country populated by giant sexually abusive mushrooms, a realm that changes Tomo's gender, etc. Explicit sexual scenes occupy a large portion of the game.</p>",

The bereaved king of the Lake Country seeks the help of the powerful goddess Lua as he tries to remove the curse that has befallen his son. However, the prince feels it is his duty to defeat the evil wizard responsible for the curse, and he embarks on a journey to gather mysterious artifacts that will help him achieve this goal.</p>\n<p>Gameplay-wise, the game is very similar to its predecessor. The prince explores maze-like overhead areas, fighting enemies with ranged magic and power-ups. The sequel expands equipment management, allowing the player to change equipped items at any time.</p>",

Human civilization has expanded beyond the Milky Way, but further advancement was made difficult due to the presence of strong, consolidated alien nations beyond the borders of the galaxy. The events of the game take place in the Gardinal star system not far from the Milky Way. The player is cast into the role of Exas Graft, the human (\"Earthman\", according to the game's terminology) leader of the small Parsian Republic. Eleven nations are present in the region, and Graft must defend his new homeland through skillful diplomacy and military strategy.</p>\n<p>The game's basic gameplay rules remain similar to those of the two previous installments. Like before, the focus of the game is on grand strategy \u2014 resource management, research, diplomacy, etc., rather than on combat tactics. Like in the preceding games, combat occurs automatically and the player can only choose general commands during his turn. The interface has been revamped, with a much larger viewing area of the star system and no fixed windows for menus. <em>Wakusei Dethperant</em> is more character-oriented than the previous entries in the series, depicting unique alien races and assigning personality traits and distinct visual appearance to each leader and general. The game's visuals also have a more pronounced anime flavor.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/58133/bacta/\">Bacta</a> directly continues the story initiated in the first game. The paranormal investigator Jinpachi Tanaka was unable to defeat the female demon Dirsala, and she intends to resurrect the mysterious magical creation known as Bacta. In order to prevent that Jinpachi must work together with the local police and his faithful assistance, all the while continuing to save young women from demonic possession in his own unique ways.</p>\n<p>Gameplay-wise, the sequel is identical to the predecessor. The Japanese-style adventure gameplay relies on selecting verb commands and combining them with objects in a text menu. It is impossible to get stuck or permanently die in the game, and many of the options, though not necessary to select for triggering the next event, are there for humorous reasons.</p>",

The game does not offer a new storyline in the introduction and instead simply allows players to control female fighters and compete in an enigmatic tournament. Unlike the first game, the player can select between five characters in the story mode, defeating the opponents one-by-one in a linear fashion and facing two non-controllable enemies in the end. All the five characters are new - none of the heroines of the previous game returns.</p>\n<p>Compared to its predecessor, the game has a more elaborate control scheme, allowing executing of several unique moves and attacks per character by pressing down keys or combining them with directional arrows. These special moves include ranged fire and electricity attacks, complex jumps, grappling, etc. The difficulty level is noticeably higher as well. The player can select between three difficulty levels. Erotic pictures of the girls can be seen only if the game is completed on Normal or Hard (not Easy) difficulty.</p>",

The game introduces six new pre-made characters in various races and classes. The player can choose to either export these characters to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/58643/record-of-lodoss-war-ii-goshiki-no-maryu/\">Record of Lodoss War II: Goshiki no Mary\u016b</a>, or import player-created characters from there. The player then builds a party out of any of these characters to go through either of the two modes: a series of battles in different locations and an exploration of a pseudo-3D third-person dungeon. The first mode allows shopping, resting, and healing in a generic town before engaging in combat; the second mode allows only a two-character party and awards items and equipment as rewards for guessing correctly what type of monsters ambushes the heroes in specific rooms.</p>",

The game features the same six characters as in the previous entry. Like before, these characters can be swapped with those of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/58643/record-of-lodoss-war-ii-goshiki-no-maryu/\">Record of Lodoss War II: Goshiki no Mary\u016b</a>; new to this installment is the possibility to import and export characters to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/58756/sword-world-pc/\">Sword World PC</a>. There are only two battle scenarios and no possibility to visit a town or acquire items. The dungeon exploration mode is gone as well and is replaced by a quiz mini-game in which the player takes control of Parn, one of the series' main protagonists, on a quest to defeat Emperor Beld. The player has to answer trivia questions within time limit and use abilities of Parn's companions to make this task easier.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Regional Power III</em> is a space strategy game. The player can either create an own scenario in a randomly generated map (setting the values for the number of planets and difficulty), or follow the campaign mode consisting of several scenarios, the first of which is set in the Tullaze star system and puts the player in control of the nascent Toran Federation. There is no option to select a scenario from the campaign directly from the main menu.</p>\n<p>The game is very similar to its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/58649/regional-power-ii/\">predecessor</a> visually as well as gameplay-wise. The interface is nearly identical, though a few adjustments and refinements have been made: for example, planet surfaces are more detailed, and there are more precise options for colonization, construction, spaceship customization and research. The most noticeable choice is the addition of a new group in the command menu, which deals with interplanetary construction in player-controlled space, such as for example transportation routes between planets.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Oshioki Kirai! 2</em> is a humorous arcade-style action game. The player controls a permanently running character who must escape from a giant human attempting to kill him. The game is divided into stages taking place in the same area but featuring different opponents. Each opponent is presented as an animated digitized image of a gigantic person towering over the stage while the protagonist keeps running in a pseudo-3D motion away from the depth of the screen. The player must move the hero left and right in order to avoid attacks. If the player character is hit three times he dies and the game is over. Surviving for a certain while eventually leads to the opponent's demise and the end of the stage.</p>\n<p>The opponents have comical appearance and try to kill the protagonist with various household items, mostly connected to food. For example, one of the foes attempts to pierce the hero with chopsticks, while another cleans his nose and throws gigantic dirty napkins on him. Digitized photos of various related scenes announce new rounds in the game.</p>",

The player character (different in each scenario) and the AI-controlled opponent take turns in moving over a map divided into fields. The objective is to attain the goal of the scenario before the opponent. Each scenario, however, involves repeated visits to the same fields to trigger events and advance the story, giving the game a light adventure-like flavor. </p>\n<p>Both the player character and the opponent have hit points, which can be reduced by stepping on fields with negative effects (such as hostile creatures, traps, etc.), but also replenished on other fields. Losing all hit points brings the character to square one. The game includes some scenes with explicit nudity.</p>",

In 1989 the inhabitants of the great underground city of Kanazawa had to defend themselves against an unusual peril: a tornado that took away the clothes of high school girls. The game consists of one-screen stages. The player controls a pad similar to those found in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=pong\">Pong</a> games, moving it right and left (with limited up and down mobility) on the screen. Various objects keep falling down; some are beneficial (mushrooms enlarge the pad, coins increase score, clocks lengthen the time limit, etc.), while others (rocks, stop signs, etc.) are harmful, leading to a loss of a life and eventually to Game Over if the player-controlled pad touches them. </p>\n<p>Other objects include speed-ups and exit signs, which automatically take the player to the next level. This, however, is hardly the goal, as the stages have to be completed the ordinary way, withstanding the onslaught of the objects for a sufficient amount of time. The bonus rewards are then calculated, and the player is shown a full-screen, full-color picture of the girl. Among the falling objects are also clothes items of the girl whose picture is shown in the background during gameplay; accumulating a sufficient amount of those leads to a nude picture of the girl.</p>",

Each girl has her own preferences as well as parameters that describe her feelings towards the protagonist. The goal is to raise these parameters (and ultimately the girls' \"love level\") by repeatedly going on dates. From time to time the player is required to make choices that would influence subsequent dating. There is an internal clock that is advanced every time the player character goes on a date. Successful dating results in explicit erotic scenes.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Sword World PC</em> is based on the Japanese table role-playing game <em>Sword World</em>, itself based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=record+of+lodoss+wars\">Record of Lodoss Wars</a> light novels which were initially created as role-playing \"replays\" of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=D%26D\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>. It is set in the medieval world of Forcelia, which includes both the Lodoss island and the continent of Crystania from a series spin-off. The setting is similar to D&amp;D games, having familiar medieval fantasy elements such as magic, races like elves and dwarves, etc.</p>\n<p>Despite its Japanese origins and anime-style visuals, the game is closer to Western RPG format and attempts to recreate a table role-playing experience without focusing on character development or a linear plot. Though certain quests must be completed and events triggered in order to advance in the game, the player is for the most part free to venture to any city of the game world in any order. Navigation between the cities is menu-based, i.e. there is no wilderness exploration. Specific dungeons and other hostile areas can be accessed only by receiving respective missions. In such areas, as well as in locations within towns, player-controlled party can be physically navigated from an overhead perspective.</p>\n<p>Character creation involves choosing a race (Human, Dwarf, Elf, two types of Half-Elves, or a halfling-like GrassRunner) and a class (Bard, Fighter, Priest, Ranger, Sage, Shaman, Sorcerer, or Thief). Character statistics and abilities are similar to those of D&amp;D games. The player creates only one character, while the rest of the party consists of NPCs that can be convinced to join. Combat takes place in the same area as exploration and is of the tactical turn-based variety, allowing characters to move on the screen.</p>",

Shinichi is then chosen to be the test subject of the new virtual reality device, participating in adventures where his sexual powers are tested above all.</p>\n<p><em>Paradise Arena</em> consists of four independent \"virtual reality\" scenarios, each dedicated to a particular theme as the protagonists visits a harem, enters an agency that promotes pop singers, is hired as a tutor, and travels to an airport. Each scenario consists almost entirely of seduction scenes that eventually lead to explicit sex scenes. The game plays similarly to visual novels, albeit with several choices during every scene. Rather than making one decision, the player has to repeatedly select options and check how they influence a counter that reports the woman's mood. When this counter reaches zero the game is over.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Patlabor: Operation Tokyo Bay</em> is a real-time city-building simulation somewhat similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=SimCity\">SimCity</a> series. The setting is taken from the Patlabor anime series, more specifically <em>Patlabor: The Movie</em> (1989). The story begins in 1998, when Tokyo Bay undergoes a drastic re-development, which includes the construction of artificial islands under the codename \"Babylon Project\". The player is entrusted with the task of designing the infrastructure of the city. Four types of pre-made transportation networks can be selected before the actual construction begins. The player is also prompted to position electricity, water, and other resources on the map before getting started.</p>\n<p>The game then proceeds in real time, with natural disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons, etc. frequently disrupting the player's progress. The player assigns team to work on construction projects and also invests money in the development. It is possible to build hotels, schools, parks, factories, and other types of urban scenery. </p>\n<p>The key plot element of the movie - the series' trademark giant mechas known as Labors mysteriously going rogue - is also used for gameplay purposes. Hostile Labors would randomly assault the team, and the player has to decide whether to attack or negotiate with them. Defeated or otherwise convinced Labors then join the team and affect the city's future development.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The year is 2035. A series of mysterious incidents began to occur in Tokyo. Young women disappeared under strange circumstances, and returned brainwashed, commanding armies of bionic monsters and assaulting human settlements. Such women were called \"Possessioners\". A special all-female squad was formed to face them in combat and bring them back to humanity.</p>\n<p><em>Possessioner</em> is primarily a Japanese-style adventure game. The player selects verb commands from a menu and combines them with objects appearing afterwards to interact with the environment and trigger events. Navigation is menu-based as well. The game also contains sporadic turn-based battles against the Possessioners and their minions. Four female combatants have a variety of attacks at their disposal, but the battles are fairly simple and there is no role-playing system. The game contains scenes with nudity and explicit, exclusively lesbian sex scenes.</p>",

He has a tendency to voyeurism and likes spying on girls and taking their photos. One day his young and attractive teacher catches him during such an escapade, and as a result he is obliged to follow her orders, which may also include sexual services.</p>\n<p><em>Rabyni</em> (A Russian word meaning \"female slaves\") plays like a Japanese-style adventure, albeit without regular verb commands and no possibility to interact with the environment by selecting objects from a menu. Most of the gameplay involves repeatedly visiting different locations and triggering events. There are no branches in the storyline. Explicit sexual cutscenes are animated.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/45609/zavas/\">Zavas</a> is, like its predecessor, a fantasy role-playing game with Japanese anime-like aesthetics, but more Western-oriented free-form gameplay with more emphasis on character development than on a character-driven plot. Through a series of choices the player make the protagonist (always named Majon, but with different family names) to be a prince, the son of a merchant, or the son of a fisherman. In the beginning the player character undergoes a series of trials (which may include arcade-style mini-games, mathematical tasks, etc.) which determine his eventual attributes and also follow his growth until he turns sixteen and embarks on a quest to find companions and defeat an evil sorcerer in accordance with an ancient prophecy.</p>\n<p>Though the game has a traditional overworld with towns, hostile areas, and fairly simple turn-based battles, many of its gameplay features deviate from the standard Japanese template. Every NPC can be approached with different attitudes (including bribe and usage of items), and often a specific attitude is needed to further the hero's goals. Money can be earned and managed through various activities. Experience points are awarded for conversations and other actions besides combat. An important factor is the party's stamina: a certain amount of it must be reached in order to access key plot-advancing locations, and building up stamina through side quests and other actions occupies a considerable portion of the gameplay. The protagonist has a ship at his disposal from the beginning of the game, and it is possible to physically sail across the sea and access any location, provided the stamina level is high enough.</p>",

The protagonist of the game is a male college student who frequents the cafe and gradually develops a relationship with Kiyoka. Though there are two other female characters in the game, the dating aspect focuses exclusively on Kiyoka. </p>\n<p>Like in most visual novels, interaction is sporadic and limited; as opposed to most representatives of the genre, instead of making a choice between two or more context-specific actions the player is prompted to select a command (\"Look\", \"Talk\", or \"Action\") within a time limit. Failure to make a choice, however, does not incur any penalty besides slightly influencing subsequent events. When dating Kiyoka the player is able to choose a location for the date, which also affects the following scenes. Eventually the couple engages in sexual intercourse, which is displayed explicitly.</p>",

Years of bitter antagonism and violence followed as humans settled in the land of Galesnia. A thousand years later, a simple warrior named Grog enters a forest inhabited by monsters, and becomes gradually involved in a struggle that puts him in the forefront of the defense of Galesnia.</p>\n<p><em>Guernica</em> is a Japanese-style role-playing game with radically simplified gameplay mechanics. There is no party, no monetary system, and no equipment of any kind. Only bars and inns can be accessed in towns. The world map is completely linear, as the protagonist is only able to move on the roads and locations appear on it only when triggered by the plot. Much of the game consists of exploring hostile locations, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat that allows only physical attacks and usage of healing items that are randomly dropped by the foes. The game's cutscenes mostly depict explicit sexual encounters.</p>",

Nearly the whole game is set on the train itself, with only a few locations accessible within. </p>\n<p><em>Sexpress</em> is built like a visual novel, with the player's input entirely confined to selecting locations on the train, triggering scenes. Each such scene advances the time needed for the train to reach the next stop. The goal is to develop relationships with the several female characters onboard the train, and unlock as many sex scenes as possible with them. New girls board the train continuously as the journey advances. Failure to trigger a sufficient amount of scenes will end the trip (and the journey) prematurely before the final destination (Quebec) is reached.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Tir-nan-\u00f3g: Descendants of Danaan</em> is a role-playing game based on Irish mythology, more specifically the story of T\u00edr na n\u00d3g (the land of eternal youth) and the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann (people of the goddess Dana). The main plot of the game is only loosely based on actual Irish myths and involves the fictional kingdom of Annafofo, the assault of demons, the abduction of the princess, and a legendary hero who must rectify all that and restore peace in the land.</p>\n<p>Despite its Japanese origins, the game follows a Western template, focusing on non-linear exploration rather than a character-driven plot. The game begins with the player controlling a single pre-defined character, though some NPCs will be able to join the party. All navigation in the game is done by moving an arrow representing the party on the world map or through the dungeons, which are viewed from a top-down perspective as well. Towns have no graphics at all and all interaction there is menu-based. Turn-based combat takes place on separate overhead screens and resembles that of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Ultima\">Ultima</a> games, allowing free movement on the battle field.</p>",

The game is an adult visual novel. The gameplay consists entirely of making choices. \nThe player chooses destinations (a village, a castle, a cave, etc.) from a map screen, moving the heroine ahead and advancing the story. In some key points during the plot, the heroine may encounter an enemy. The player fights the enemy making full use of decided choices, such as attack, defense, etc. \nHowever, the heroine always wins irrespective of the player's decisions.</p>",

        "description": "<p>You start the game as a member of a mercenary squad piloting Motor Shells, infantry mechs deployed from space. The squad is under contract by the government and stationed onboard the battleship Dragonet, tasked with various dirty jobs like subduing colonial uprisings and cleaning up orbital bio factories that have gone out of control. Inevitably events unfold that leave you as the only one who can prevent a mysterious invader from taking control of the galaxy.</p>\n<p>Starcraft Inc. is mainly known for porting numerous popular western games from DOS to Japanese home computer systems like PC-98 and FM Towns. Starfire is one of their few original games, but uses an engine taken from the Might &amp; Magic series of games they translated and ported to PC-98 in the early 90's. It retains the 3D first person dungeon crawler navigation and sprite based graphics, but the classic RPG encounters are replaced with a simple real time action-based combat where you shoot the enemies as they appear on screen. Instead of levels and experience points you increase your combat stats through upgrades from engineers and doctors. Killing enemies provide you with credits to spend at item shops and arms dealers.</p>\n<p>Eventually you gain access to a space ship, which enables you to travel the galaxy. That also means running into hostile space ships that you will have to fend off in simple space battles. To unravel the plot you have to visit the various systems and their space stations and talk with the characters that live on them, eliminating space pirates and alien forces along the way.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Farland Story: Juuou no Akashi</em> is the seventh entry in the <em>Farland Story</em> series, and the final installment for the PC-98. Like its predecessor, <em>Juuou no Akashi</em> brings the familiar, light tactics gameplay of the rest of the series to a brand-new setting. This world is filled with the descendants of beast-gods, who can transform into the animal of their tribe. You play as Van, the son of the chief of the Lion Tribe, who meets a human princess trying to lift the curse a beastman placed on her father. Van recruits a colorful cast of characters from the various beast tribes, as well as humans, fairies, elves, and vampires.</p>\n<p>As in the rest of the series, the game is split between lengthy dialogue scenes and top-down turn-based tactical battles. In battle, you issue commands to each of your units to move, attack, and cast spells, and the enemies do the same on their turn. Each character earns experience immediately after attacking or counter-attacking, and can pick up weapons from the defeated enemies.</p>\n<p>Like in the previous installment, each character has a unique ability, like a stealth mode, or diving to move quickly in water, or causing an earthquake. In addition, beast characters can transform in and out of their animal form to alter their statistics and abilities.</p>",

Players take the role of Alex, a warrior in a mecha suit who witnesses the destruction of his hometown by invaders from space.</p>\n<p>The game plays out like a typical turn-based RPG with some exceptions such as the ability to target multiple enemies in one attack and healing by taking steps. Alex also gains back some HP after each battle. Alex can increase his max HP by either leveling up after gathering enough experience or finding power-ups hidden in various areas and can jump to get over gaps in caves. The enemies are not visible on the map and the random encounter rate is set quite high. Battles are shown in an over-the-shoulder perspective similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7748/phantasy-star-ii/\">Phantasy Star II</a>. Enemies can be at different distances to the protagonist, the further they are away from him, the more likely the player is to escape from a battle or attack first.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Story of King Aress</em> is a turn-based strategy game taking place in the world of Elenes. Players take control of Aress, who, on his 16th birthday, wakes up in hopes of getting a surprise from his father Rudolph Adfral, but finds only a letter informing him that he is actually the son of a king and was taken into custody in order to protect him from harm. Having brought up and taught Aress for 16 years, his adoptive father ends the letter by telling Aress that he's free to choose his fate when he becomes the king. Aress goes out on an adventure with his two friends to claim the throne and restore his home country.</p>\n<p>The game takes place in a world map where players choose where they want to go. After making a choice, players will encounter dialogues or cutscenes which will be accompanied with a battle. Combat is turn-based with the players clicking on the characters they wish to control and moving them to an available area. When players attack the enemy or vice versa, the attacks will be shown in a different perspective. Combat is quite slow paced as both characters take turns to approach each other and land a hit with each character attacking multiple times in one turn. Characters on the battlefield may attack with different weapons, such as bows and arrows, swords, spears, clubs and other blunt weapons.</p>",

This process is repeated until either the villain is found or time expires and they are able to get away.</p>\n<p>Along with finding out where the thief has headed, the player must discover who the thief is, by best matching personal characteristics (gender, hair color, eye color, hobbies, notable features) to dossiers on Carmen's gang. There must be enough characteristics matched in order to obtain a warrant, which is essential to legally arrest the suspect once they have been found.

The main character is Zion, a magic user that finds out that a friendly town-person's daughter has been kidnapped by the Dark Wraith as part of a periodic ritual sacrifice. Up to four other characters can accompany Zion as he searches various dungeons in search of the Dark Wraith. As with many Japanese dungeon crawlers, characters are not created by the player. Rather, they are met throughout the story. However, upon leveling up, the player gets to assign points to various skills and attributes. The game features turn-based combat with enemies appearing within the dungeon, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Might+and+Magic\">Might and Magic</a> games.</p>",

After an excavator they've hired is killed by a trap in the pyramid, Professor Tsuchida decides to make use of the Japanese tourists he had seen when entering the pyramid as cannon fodder.</p>\n<p>Players take control of Ayuto Asaki, an 18 year old high school graduate who was chosen by the Professor to lead the group and they will need to go deeper into the pyramid to find the secrets of the pyramid. While going through the game, players will need to do certain actions if they wish to avoid the deaths of the 11 people that ventured into the pyramid. These actions are pushing or pulling objects, crawling through small openings, looking up, taking certain items. Some of these actions may also be used in the turn-based battles that the game offers. These battles are triggered by the events of the plot or by random encounters.</p>",

        "description": "<p>It is the year 2086. Earth has finally joined the Galactic Union; people, knowledge, and technology can now freely travel to and from Earth. New technology is solving many of humanity's problems, such as disease and food shortage, and galactic tourism is quickly becoming a boon for Earth's economy. However, not all changes are positive: with its borders open, Earth is no longer considered a protected location by the Galactic Union, and not everyone who might come to the planet is there just to see the sights. The Galaxy Police are dedicated to fighting interplanetary crime, and while they may provide the tools, Earth itself must provide the talent, and those recruits are going to need some training to keep the peace.</p>\n<p><em>MeltyLancer</em> is a life simulation game similar to -- and by the same designers as -- <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1861/graduation-for-windows-95/\">Graduation</a>, in which the player is tasked with training a squad of six young Tokyo Eastern Metro Police recruits, called Lancers. The main core of the game is determining each Lancer's weekly schedule: which days are they on patrol, which days on standby, and which days do they have off? After the general schedule is determined, the player meets with each Lancer to speak with them directly, determining specific actions they'll take that week; whether they spend a day training, exercising, or getting some much-needed rest will affect their stats and ability to complete missions. While on patrol or on special missions, battles may occur, which can be partially controlled with a handful of commands but mostly play out automatically. Each of the six Lancers has their own abilities, personalities, and specialties.</p>\n<p>A mini-CD containing the game's theme song is also included in the package.</p>",

The player takes the role of Tanuma, with orders from shogun Tokugawa Ieharu to revitalize the capital of Edo and build reserves of six million ry\u014d. The player's primary interaction is managing economic factors such as taxes, budgets, and investments, including public works projects and even international trade. Scientific and cultural advancements also play a major part in progression, with the city visibly changing and developing in real-time as the economy grows.</p>",
