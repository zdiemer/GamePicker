While they're playing fetch, Baku finds a curious doll, which springs to life and tells her that the Kingdom of Memories is in trouble: the vegetables are revolting, and she's the only one who can stop them! The doll, Judy, and an alarm clock named Clock lead Momo and Baku there, and so their adventure begins.</p>\n<p><em>Wan Wan Aij\u014d Monogatari</em> is a simple Japanese-style adventure game designed for young girls. The majority of the game consists of written dialogue with cute animated characters. There are dialogue choices every so often, though they have only a minimal impact on the story progression. The player can also jump back to specific scenes, and print a variety of stickers with images from the game.</p>",
