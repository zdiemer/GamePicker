The player takes control of Boing, a green blob whose time machine has crashed in a strange world full of weird and nasty creatures. To be able to get his time machine working again and leave, he has to locate and collect a number of items that lies scattered around the lands: twenty potions, a crystal, a battery and a lever. The game world consists of a number of interconnected screens and can be explored in any order. As in the Dizzy series, puzzle solving is a central part of the game. This involves picking up items and then using them at the right locations. The player has an inventory that is limited to three items. Enemies wander around the world in predefined patterns and although they don't directly attack the player, they deal damage when contact is made. There's no combat in the game and enemies can not be killed so the player has to avoid them by jumping over them. In addition to enemies the player has to watch out for spikes and long falls to avoid instant death. After dying the player has to restart the game from the beginning as there are no save points.</p>",

The player can move in multiple directions and automatically shoots in the direction faced. By holding the fire button the direction of fire is locked. Various power ups can be collected, including extra lives, increased speed and multi-directional fire.

        "description": "<p><em>Lost disks of SAM</em> is a SAM Coup\u00e9 conversion of the ZX Spectrum game <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/65727/the-lost-tapes-of-albion/\">Lost Tapes of Albion</a></em>.</p>\n<p>The main character Moebius is a \"renowned collector of intergalactic tat.\" After having collected lost Speccy tapes in the last game, Moebius realises that \"no self-respecting tat-collector could be complete without a set of SAM Coup\u00e9 games that never were released\" and sets out on a dangerous platform adventure.</p>\n<p>In a single screen platform game like they were done in the arcades in the early eighties, you control Moebius as he runs between the eight floors of each of the twelve levels, filled with floppy disks and dangerous nasties of four kinds. The floors are connected to the left and right, so that running off-screen to the right puts you on the left of the platform below, or on the top platform if you happen to be on the bottom floor. Most of the time, though, it is better to use the teleport platforms interspersed throughot the floors, where you push up or down to move to the platform below or above. This is needed in order to avoid the nasties patrolling each floor, ranging from the mindless Chomper to the robotic Homer which turns your way whenever you're on the same platform, or the mindless but very speedy Pucky, which seems to be modeled on the Coup\u00e9 mascot SAM the Robot.</p>\n<p>Between levels are short sequences showing the recovered disk and Moebius changing into a new suit for the next level. The game has also been remade for the Amiga as <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/64552/the-incredible-adventures-of-moebius-goatlizard/\">Moebius Goatlizard</a></em>.</p>",

Like that game it is a snake game that is played inside a maze where the objective is to eat all the dots while avoiding crashing into the snake's tail. As the snake eats the dots it grows in size which makes the game increasingly harder. This variant is more puzzle oriented than the original featuring a slower pace and the snake does not move forward automatically. The mazes are tight with little extra space when the snake reaches full growth meaning it is necessary to plan ahead. To complete a level the snake has to eat all dots in the maze. The game is timed and the player has two minutes to complete each level. It is game over when the player has lost all three lives.</p>",

The player is presented with a number of tiles layered on top of each other and the aim of the game is to have them removed by matching tiles with the same symbol and colour. To match a tile it has to be visible but unlike other mahjongg solitaire games it does not need to have free space to the sides. If the player gets stuck he has to use the quit button and replay the level while losing a life. Extra lives are given for every 20,000 points reached or by completing a level within a time limit. Some special tiles exist which affect other tiles when matched. There are bombs which destroy four neighbours, twirlers which rotates adjacent tiles and flippers which swap the positions of tiles.</p>\n<p><em>The Viking Game</em> is based on the board game Tafl and is played by two players (no AI option exist). One player has 24 black pieces while the other has 12 white ones plus one king. The white pieces are located in the centre of the screen while the black ones are located by the sides. The white's objective is to move the king piece to one of four corners of the board. The black's objective is to capture the white king by placing black pieces on all four sides of the king. The pieces move like a rook in chess, any number of steps either horizontally or vertically, and are captured by being sandwiched by pieces of the other colour.</p>",

It is similar to the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/53186/sidewize/\">Sidewize</a> in that enemies appear in waves of different formations and the player has to shoot down as many of them as possible without colliding with them or getting hit by any of their projectiles. Initially the player's ship shoots single bullets at a time but by clearing out a full wave of enemies it's possible to get a power up that gives multiple shots. The kind of shot to use can be selected before starting out. Enemies appear from all sides of the screen and it's of important to find the right safe spot before they arrive. Any collision leads to a life being lost. The game has twelve levels and each one ends with a boss fight against a powerful guardian enemy.</p>",

The game takes place in a small village by the sea that has been raided by ghosts and demons led by the evil demon master. Many villagers have been captured and those that escape have come to the player who is the only person with the magical power needed to rescue them. But it has to be done before midnight so the player only has one hour, the witching hour, to complete the mission.</p>\n<p>The player controls the character with direct control like in other platform games but the game is more focused on puzzle solving than precision jumping. The player can move back and forth between the locations while avoiding dangers and interacting with characters and objects. Jumping and moving around is done with the joystick while pressing a button brings up a menu that is used for all other interactions. Similar to an adventure game, the following six commands can be used: pick up, drop, talk, use, examine and give. Most puzzles involve using an object at the right location or giving it to the right character. Only two objects can be carried at the same time.</p>",
