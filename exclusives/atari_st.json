It also features 46 different types of bricks with different properties, bonuses and penalties. </p>\n<p>The main menu allows you to access Training mode, from which you can select to play any of the 100 available layouts.</p>\n<p>Bolo's graphics are black and white only, but the game can be played either on a monochrome or color monitor. The graphics are however much sharper on a monochrome monitor. The animations are fast and smooth, and the paddle reacts quickly to the mouse movements.</p>",

Your party of four starts with nothing. No weapons, no armour and no spells. So you must collect these before engaging in combat. Since the enemies are superior the use of tactics becomes more important. You will come across a lots of traps and other obstacles during your journey through the dungeon. Like normal in role playing games you gain experience for defeating your enemies and after awhile you will get to a new level.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The story of the game is inspired by popular games of the same time, such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1466/speedball/\">Speedball</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Smash+T.V.\">Smash T.V.</a>: In the not-too-distant future, the most popular television show lets contestants battle it out in an all-out fighting match called the Ultimate Arena.</p>\n<p>What this turns out to be is a man-versus-man fighting game with digitised graphics, which was \u00e0 la mode in American coin-ops at the time, such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1266/pit-fighter/\">Pit-Fighter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Mortal+Kombat\">Mortal Kombat</a>, complete with sprays of blood for every hit. On the Atari, the sprites aren't quite as large as in arcade games, though.</p>\n<p>At the start of a one-player game, two characters are available to play with: Terry from France and Sandy from London. All seven characters are available to choose from in two-player mode.</p>\n<p>Each player has the usual assortment of 18 jumps, kicks and punches, most of which are easily executed with a normal Atari joystick, as well as a few special moves. Some carry weapons, while some can fire energy bolts. Instead of the common best-out-of-three system, sudden death is enforced, so a opponent must be beaten on the first attempt. If you do so, another stands in line. Being pushed into a corner is also more dangerous than other similar games, since the ringside is electrified. Stay close to the centre of the arena, or you will be burnt to a crisp.</p>\n<p>Released at the far end of the Atari's commercial life, Ultimate Arena is notable for being one of few STE-only games, which makes the digitised sounds and graphics more natural than had it been a normal ST game.</p>",

Like the arcade version, and unlike most home versions, the playfield has a vertical orientation. It is no straight conversion, however, with all levels being new (and creatable by users) and the number of ghosts on-screen being variable. Ten levels are contained in the standard distribution. While the standard look mimics the original Pac-Man, the tilesets are user-creatable, in the form of standard ST resource files. Another sample tileset comes with the game. Steering is handled via keyboard, and the game is system-friendly, running on anything from an old ST (low-res screens are too small to fit the standard tileset, though) to powerful 68060-based clones and with both standard TOS and replacement operating systems.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This is a fairly faithful replica of Atari's classic arcade game, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Asteroids\">Asteroids</a>, only running in a window on the GEM desktop. As in the original, you have a ship trapped in an asteroid field. Shoot the asteroids, and they split into smaller ones, until they are eventually small enough to be destroyed completely. Your ship rotates in all directions, and the playfield wraps at the edges. In order to get out of cramped situations, you can activate your hyperspace function to be transported to a random location on the screen \u2013 hopefully with fewer asteroids. From time to time, a flying saucer will fly across the screen and shoot at you.\nLike the arcade original, this version uses vector graphics to depict the on-screen objects (albeit rendered to a raster screen). This makes the window resizable. The game can be controlled using both keyboard and, rather uncommonly, the mouse.</p>",

The isometric playfield is the same, and even the border decorations are the same. You control both Cobra and Lady, though optionally a second player may take control of Lady. You still shoot anything that moves, and have a stockpile of smart bombs to destroy anything that you failed to shoot. A star moves around the corners of the screen; follow it to find the exit to the next level. A new feature is that sessions can be saved and loaded at any point.</p>",

You can furnish your lots with different kinds of toilet seats ranging from a normal plastic one to a very expensive platinum one. You also need to supply your visitors with toilet paper which also comes in several quality classes from normal paper to silk. For the finally touch you can add some items in the toilet room like soap or condom dispensers.</p>\n<p>Depending on the quality, cleanliness and price of your toilets, you will get more or less visitors at the end of each round. To boost revenue a bit more, you can also launch three different ad-campaigns.</p>\n<p>But you're not alone in the city. Up to four players can compete against each other. Each player can also launch a sabotage attack on the lot of the enemy to increase his repair costs or send the health office down to check if the lots are clean.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ripcord</em> is a small game where you have to make sure that a parachute jumper lands in the designated area. A plane crosses the screen from right to left and by clicking the left mouse button you decide where the guy will jump, a click on the right mouse button will then release the parachute. The target area will move between jumps and sometimes wind affects the jumper. When wind affects the jump it is important to release the chute at the right time, however there is no indication of any winds until the parachute is released. </p>\n<p>A game consists of 8 jumps. There is no music in the game, only sound effects.</p>",

The aim of the game is to travel through the dungeon and at the end defeat the necromancer Malik Adbul Aziz so that you can recover the Great Orb of Thoth. Before you enter the dungeon you must select the type of character you would like to play. There are seven classes and the starting equipment depends on which class you choose:\nWarrior (sword), Fighter (dagger &amp; shield), Cleric (cloth armour &amp; one healing portion), Mage (cloth armour &amp; two magic scrolls), Thief (dagger &amp; 40 gold coins), Barbarian (Axe &amp; 10 gold coins) and Superhero (nothing).</p>\n<p>In the dungeon you will encounter enemies such as zombies, skeletons, bats, etc. When you have defeated an enemy a treasure chest appears which is yours to loot. Now and then you will encounter stairs in the dungeon. These stairs leads to villages where you can buy better equipment, have a drink in the tavern and deposit gold in the bank.</p>\n<p>The amount of stuff you can carry is limited. You can carry one hand weapon, one range weapon, one set of range ammo, one armour type, one shield, three potions, three scrolls and up to 99 gold coins (extra gold can be deposited in the bank).</p>\n<p>The game is totally mouse controlled.</p>",

The game is set in the Middle Ages (starting year is 1357) and has the player start their career as a trader in Bristol with only a sloop, one crew member and just under 1000 pounds at their disposal. There are seven different goods available for trade: corn, wood, spices, salt, wool, gems, and ale. \nShips and their crew can be armed with four different weapons (cannons, guns, bows, and swords) to increase the chances of the player's fleet to fend off attacks from the pirates they might attract. Once a ship is loaded and enough crew members have been hired, one of seven different cities can be selected to trade with (there are eight cities in the game): London, Brugge, Hamburg, L\u00fcbeck, Malm\u00f6, Riga and Novgorod.</p>\n<p>Random events such as floods can affect the prices of certain types of goods. With enough money, the merchant fleet can also be expanded with new ships. In <em>Trader 2</em>, there are three types of ships, all with different cargo capacity: Hulk (100 tons), Merchantman (60 tons) and Sloop (20 tons).</p>\n<p>The game has no sound and is controlled with the mouse.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A game named after an East-Asian city is invariably either a variation on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Shanghai\">Shanghai</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Towers+of+Hanoi\">Towers of Hanoi</a> theme. Peking is a version of the aforementioned, for the Atari ST series.</p>\n<p>The point is to identify pairs of tiles in a pyramid arrangement viewed from above, thereby removing them from the stack. Only tiles which are not covered by other tiles can be removed, which calls for care when choosing which tiles to remove in which order.</p>\n<p>Version 2.0 of Peking is well-endowed with options, allowing you to save and load games, save screenshots, an undo function and a function to identify pairs when you are lost. Even more cheat-oriented is the option to remove tiles from the pile Additionally, two players can play at once, each player being given a set number of seconds to find a pair before relinquishing to mouse to the opponent. When the game is ended, the score for each player is calculated.</p>\n<p>To vary things a bit, a number of tilesets are integrated in the game. Apart from the traditional mahjongg tiles, there is a set of flags, a traffic sign set and a set of pictogrammes. The game runs in both colour and black and white, in high and low resolutions.</p>",

While the old version had four different tilesets built in, version 3 keeps tiles as separate data files, which can be downloaded or created by the user. A set of traditional tiles in three different resolutions is part of the standard package, with more available at the game's homepage, including cards, flags, traffic signs, a Christmas theme as well as a high resolution mahjong tileset digitised from actual pieces.</p>\n<p>Not only the tiles can be changed, but also the layout, which is stored as separate files. No longer is the game limited to the typical Shanghai pyramid. The backdrop colour can be altered, and there is a floating toolbar for retracting or suggesting moves. The two-player mode is still available, as are all the other features of version 2.0.</p>",

Weapon systems are limited to a plain gun with a small reloading interval. All the participants are represented by big, floating smiling faces. Up to sixteen players may compete simultaneously, but those who wish to train before a match can do it alone against drones. It is possible both to play one against all or to team up.</p>",

On a playfield filled with squares, tiles with diagonal and angled lines pop up from below, and it is your job to make a connection from the left to the right by moving the tiles so that the lines with their different angles connect. Moving tiles is done by moving a cursor, two tiles high, which will swap out the two tiles it is covering.</p>\n<p>The actual story of Godpey is about a poor monkey who has lost all his vegetables. After rejecting the idea of making vegetables out of Alan Titchmarsh, he comes to the conclusion that drawing lines will somehow take him to his veggies.</p>\n<p><em>Godpey</em> features a lot of gameplay modes, unlocked by gathering experience points. While the most basic mode is just about simple connecting for as long as you can stand it, the next mode adds a stress elements since no tile must ever be pushed off the playfield. In other modes, you play against time for points, or are presented with screens already filled with tiles that you must arrange into one big branching line involving each and every tile. The final mode is the story mode, which tells the story of the monkey in pretty cut-scenes. As you level up, the monkey is adorned with a new vegetable-themed hat.</p>\n<p><em>Godpey</em> can be played alone, against a friend or against the computer.</p>",

At the beginning of the game you have three lives and three bombs (the amount of bombs is restored at the beginning of each new level) and to advance to the next level you have to collect all the red dots. Special bonus dots give you increased speed for a short time. Monsters such as ghosts, candles and light bulbs move around the levels and you have to avoid them, placing a bomb in an enemy's path blows him up. A map in the lower right part of the screen shows you where you are and where the monsters are.</p>",

Sometimes barrage balloons appears and shooting them decreases your opponents score by one. Gravity can be turned on (default) or off.

Every time you eat a diamond the snake grows. If you crash into a wall or into your own tail you die. Every level contains a variety of other devices, most of them potentially lethal. At the end of each level you get bonus points for remaining time and you also get a password so that you don't have to start from the beginning next time you play. Among the devices you encounter in the game are doors (which requires keys), mushrooms (which reverses the controls a short time) and bombs (explodes when activated).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Blag</em> is an adventure game created with STAC. You take on the roll of Detective Constable Adrian Blunder newly transferred to the small British village Woolendon. Woolendon is a lovely place to live if you are after the \nquiet way of life, but that was exactly what Blunder didn't want. He wanted crime and plenty of it. By the end of his first day in Woolendon things changes and he finds himself investigating a bank robbery.</p>\n<p>The game attempts to follow the line of a police investigation of a serious crime at a quiet town, right through to \nthe eventual trial of the accused. When you think that you have conducted a sufficient investigation type court at the prompt to see how the trial goes. One can say that the game consists of two parts mixed together: exploring and questioning. In exploring mode you walk, drive, look, pick up things etc like in any other text adventure. The questioning mode is invoked by the ask command and can be used when you encounter a villager. When you think you have finished the questioning just type thanks to return to exploring mode.</p>",

After completing a level you will gain a time bonus of 120 seconds that will be added to your remaining time. </p>\n<p>New in this version is the possibility to continue the game from the level you died at, redrawn graphics and the possibility to use new sets of levels.</p>",

You control Spud and the aim of the game is to collect all the diamonds on every level before the time runs out. Before you start a new level you will see a map of the level and various bits of information about the level. As you dig and collect diamonds you have to be careful of boulders, because they will only stay still on flat surfaces and once they fall you cannot out run them. Monsters and pulsators will try to stop you in your quest and they have to be killed in order to complete the level. Monsters will follow Spud around the screen and can be killed using boulders. Pulsators always follows the walls and the will always turn left if they have to choose direction. To kill a pulsator you have to guide it into a trap where it will turn into a diamond. </p>\n<p>In some levels you will encounter teleporters. They will teleport Spud to another position in the level, but they can only be used once. All teleporters must be used before a level can be completed.</p>\n<p>A password system lets you start on any level you visited so far. Rockfall 2 also comes with a built in level editor (a included level can be edited once you have completed it and received it's editor code). Each set of levels have their own high score list which is saved to disc. 2 sets of levels are included with the game, representing a total of 90 levels. The default set is completely new, unlike the other set which is based on those levels which came with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/33905/rockfall-special-edition/\">Rockfall Special Edition</a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>PicrossST</em> is a nonogramme puzzle game for the Atari ST, similar to Nintendo's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6033/marios-picross/\">Picross</a> series.</p>\n<p>The player is presented with a grid, surrounded by numbers on the top and left sides. These numbers represent the number of squares on that row or column that shall be filled. On a 15x15 grid, a number fifteen means that the entire row or column should form a straight line across the grid, whereas the numbers \u201d10, 3\u201d on the left mean that that row should have one line of 10 filled squares and another shorter line of 3 squares. These lines must have at least one blank square to separate them. Using deduction, it is possible to fill in all the right squares, thereby forming a simple picture.</p>\n<p>The implementation in <em>PicrossST</em> starts out with the program choosing to reveal a row and column at random to help the player out. After that, he is on his own. Using the mouse, squares can either be coloured or marked as presumably empty, a bit like <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=MS+R%C3%B6j\">Minesweeper</a></em>. Marking a blank square as empty is punished with a time deduction, which means that you can trade time for hints.</p>\n<p>Two players may play at once, but in a cooperative manner. The game also comes with a grids editor for constructing puzzles of your own.</p>",

However, the AC 2008 edition is a test of endurance and fast thinking. All puzzles are random-generated so that it is not possible to solve the puzzle by trying to see a picture in it. Furthermore, it is very unforgiving, with a fast countdown. Time is added to the countdown when the player marks a filled cell in the grid correctly. Controversely, erroneously filling a cell results in a big deduction on the time available. The aim is to get as high a score as possible, rather than just playing for leisure.</p>",

Red grunts simply walk left and right. Green monsters can also jump down platforms. Robots try to seek you out and can also climb up platforms. There are two types of floating enemies, rockets that move from left to right and squid like creatures that go up and down.

Brick walls can be destroyed by placing a bomb right next to them. There is something hidden behind each wall, but not everything is worth collecting. Things you may find includes extra bombs, power increase, score bonuses and a mystery pick up. The game consists of ten levels and every level must be completed under 2 minutes and 30 seconds. </p>\n<p>At the first level there is one enemy and as you progress the number of enemies increases, they don't lay bombs but they kill on contact. The more walls you destroy and enemies you kill the more points you get, if you leave a level without killing all enemies or destroying all the walls a large number of points will be deducted from your score. Last but not least: you only have one life.</p>",

The cards must be eliminated pairwise and this can be done horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (gives most points). If you end up with cards that can't be removed you lose a life and when all lives are gone you lose the game. </p>\n<p>The game consists of 25 levels and as you progress you will have to remove more and more cards and new cards will also show up.</p>\n<p>The game is heavily inspired by one of the mini games in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/22341/new-super-mario-bros/\">Super Mario Bros</a>\n on the Nintendo DS. The DMA music is ripped from the N64 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3537/mario-party/\">Mario Party</a> and the graphics comes from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Zoo+Keeper\">Zoo Keeper</a>.</p>",

If you collect a group of six at a time you will get bonus points. Collecting crystals gives you 1000 points. Now and then letters will appear in the level, if you collect the word BONUS you will get an extra life and a smart bomb (smart bombs will kill all monsters in the level when used). Monsters roam the levels and they kill you on contact. You can kill the monsters by dropping apples on them. If you don't finish the level fast enough the monsters will become bored and mutate. At the start of the game you have three lives and two smart bombs.</p>",

Just like in the original game you buy streets, build houses and try to drive your opponents to bankruptcy. The name of the streets can be British, Irish or American. On each turn the player(s) is presented with a menu with 7 choices: Build, Mortgage, Unmortgage, Trade, Information, Resign and Roll the dice. Classic monopoly rules apply such as you have to buy a free property when you land on it (if you can't afford it it will be auctioned out) and if you roll doubles three times in a row you have to go to jail (without passing go).</p>",

In some levels there are monsters, if you hit a monster with a skull it will explode and destroy anything within 3x3 square, this can be used to open up walls to sealed gem rooms.

You can only move tiles that have an empty square as a neighbour, tiles marked block can't be moved at all. The game comes with 13 levels, all in the size of 10 x 7 tiles. </p>\n<p>You start the game with 250 points and a bonus of 250. The score and bonus will decrease over time and when a level is complete the bonus will be added to the score and the new values are transferred to the next level. When the bonus reaches 0 it will go back to 250 at the next level and start to decrease again.</p>",

The Ego Mind rules everything and it destroys and represses any threats. A small band of programmers operating through the name of Budgie UK have found and reclaimed some long lost spirit of creativity and programming magic. But since the Ego Mind sees this as a threat it is developing a counter measure inside an orbiting software satellite known as Avina Blue. The game that the Ego Mind develops is so powerful it will turn mankind into a race of zombies. It is your job to pilot a small spaceship inside Avina Blue and destroy the threat to mankind.</p>\n<p>This game is similar to Chris Skellern's earlier game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Runaway\">Runaway</a> in that you guide a space ship at high speed through narrow passages. Unlike his earlier game this one is side-scrolling, there is plenty of enemies and you can shoot them. You have 12 lives at the beginning.</p>",

The first task is to buy an oil field (there are 12 in the game) and then some drilling equipment. When you find oil you have to buy a tank car firm and some tank car's. After each players turn he/she gets to decide the amount of oil to sell this week, the maximum value is decided by how much oil and how many tank cars the player have. The richest player after 52 weeks (a year) wins. If the competitors are doing too well one can always try to sabotage his/her operation.</p>",

The play area consists of 9x9 square with metal-, grass- and pit-tiles. The pits can not be passed. In the right corner of the screen you can see what weapon current droid is carrying, how many moves it has left and how much health it has. In the left corner an arrow indicates which droid you control at the moment. At the left side of the screen you have four icons: attack, end turn, scan enemy and use item. Each of the droids has six items. They can be used at any time, and when you do so they turn dark grey to show they have been used up. The six items are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An injection: Restores the droids energy.</li>\n<li>A microchip: This gives the droid 9 moves.</li>\n<li>A powerglove: This gives the droid a greater damage on the next attack.</li>\n<li>A shield: Better defence when you are next attacked.</li>\n<li>A target: This makes the enemy droids confused.</li>\n<li>A skull: This gives the droid an advantage in the next attack round.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you destroy a droid, the players droid will receive some gold and experience points. When you have killed all enemy droids in a level the exit (in the form of stairs leading down) will appear. If your commander droid is destroyed it's game over.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Aliens</em> is a turn based combat game inspired by the movie with the same name. You take control of the eight marines and have to get them to the exit. The game consists of three levels and at level one you must get at least four to the exit and at level two and three two men. Aliens will appear continuously until you finish the level. Your marines are armed with either pistol, machine-gun, shotgun or flamethrower. How much damage they do and how far they reach depends on if you let them aim the weapons before firing; for example a pistol does 2 damage at range one unaimed and 6 damage aimed. On level two and three you may also use grenades. When an alien is hit by anything, except the flamethrower, there will be an acid splash which may hurt nearby marines.</p>",

Created sequences does not disappear all at once; if you manage to create more than one the game starts with eliminating the sequence that starts highest up to the left and moving from left to right. so if you have a horizontal sequence and a diagonal sequence booth starting at the same square you will only get points for the horizontal one and if you create a diagonal sequence and a vertical one you will only get points for the diagonal one. </p>\n<p>To make the game more interesting there are plenty of special blocks such as dynamites, flames, clocks, hammers, and so on. Different levels have different sets of blocks, from the standard square ones to pieces that looks like they are from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pipemania\">Pipedream/Pipe Mania</a>. If the situation looks grim you could always use the smart bomb to ease things up.</p>",

After the first game our hero retired to France and thought that the adventures were over. But now the ghosts are back and they want to electrocute H Mec.</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is to collect as many pills as possible and complete as many mazes as possible. Beware of the ghosts and traps. To earn lots of points you have to be fast, if you don't collect a pill within 5 seconds from the last one points will start getting deducted from your total score and if you are really slow you will lose a life. Walls can hide bonuses, such as extra time, level warp or an extra life.</p>",

Certain wheel combinations allows you to use the hold option. There is a random nudge feature which gives you up to five nudges in an upward direction.</p>\n<p>A number of fruits have numbers superimposed on them, these numbers will cause the digits on the feature line to light up. If the \"Feature held\" light appears the feature line will be held for the next go.

It is the evil Istvan who is behind it and he is demanding a ransom of 1.000.000 gold. Now it's your job to rescue her. You can choose to play one of three characters: Skeeve, Garkin or Frumple. Your adventure takes place in the land of Khlad, a land with two castles and six towns. A grid divides the map into 8 x 7 squares. At the games main menu you can select you desired action: Rest, Eat, Drink, Move, Cast spell, check your stats or remind yourself of your quest. After each move there might be a fight.</p>\n<p>There are two difficulty settings; hard and easy. If you select hard you have to search for the boat (Istvan lives on an island) by going to various towns and listen to the hints the towns people offers you. If you select easy you can ignore that and go straight to the town on the North Peninsula and someone there will tell you how to defeat Istvan.</p>",

If a worm takes the last trail leading from a dot it wins one point. If a worm enters a dot which has no free exit lines it dies.</p>\n<p>Even the human controlled worms act autonomously, but if they encounter a situation that's new to them they will wait for input from the player. The input will be stored in the worms memory so that it can recall how to act in that situation in the future. Each worm has a memory that makes it able to remember how it should act in given situations. Every worms memory can be erased. If computer controlled worms encounter a situation they don't recognise they will act at random.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Cadenza Bog</em> is a word game in medium or high resolution for one player. You have to make words out of 16 letters that are selected at random (but the probability that a letter appears is directly proportional to to the number of times that it appears in the dictionary file). The letters are arranged in cubes in a 4 x 4 pattern. Words must be formed from adjacent cubes and no cube can be used more than once. Every Cube has at least three and at most eight adjacent cubes. </p>\n<p>When you think you found all possible words press quit and see if the computer can beat you. A limitation is that the computer only can find words with at most six letters in them while a human player can find words with up to eight letters. The dictionary contains 2400 words, but it is possible to switch it with a larger one. The game is written in OSS Personal Pascal 2.0.</p>",

The idea with the game is to provide an amusement for seasoned anglers and a good introduction to coarse fishing for the beginner.</p>\n<p>From the games main menu you may select to practice, play a match or specimen hunt. There are 12 locations to fish from in the game. Among the locations are a river, a pond and a canal. If you choose to practice you may fish at any of the locations, during a match however, you are given a location. During specimen hunt you are only suppose to catch one given type of fish.</p>\n<p>The in-game screen is split in two main parts: the fishing view to the left and the equipment window to the right. You have a plethora of equipment to experiment with, such as 10 hook sizes, four rod types and so on. As bait you may use maggots, luncheon meat, bread and so on. A log keeps track of your catches and records, etc.</p>",

If you run across a question mark you may get one of several different bonuses, such as reversed joystick controls or extra points. If you run across the death item you lose a life. If the time runs out before the lives runs out it's on to the next level and the same thing happens if all the dots are eaten. Once it's game over you get to see player statistics and the high score table.</p>",

Pieces come out from six different directions, the current direction switches automatically but you can also change it manually. </p>\n<p>If you get stuck you can force the inner ring to collapse by nuking the board. You start out with three nukes and get a free one every 5000 points.</p>\n<p>The game has two difficulty levels; at novice the hexagons comes in groups of three, at standard they come in groups of four. There are three types of hexagons: normal ones with color, indestructible ones that are white and heavy ones which are clear with a white outline. The last two hexagons prevent rings from collapsing.</p>",

There are four kinds of enemies determined by brain and force in 4-points scale, and you may assign them before the start of your mission. Sitting in the cockpit in first-person view, you may speed up or turn your jet, collect different weapons such as lasers, missiles, powers, and blast the enemy tanks or environment off. You should examine the scanner to see the directions and distances of the threats, and watch the shield level until it reaches zero.</p>",

The aim of the game is to explore as much of the grid as possible and to control as many planets as possible. The player with the highest score will win. A game can consist of any number of turns between 10 and 25. The grid consists of 20x9 squares.</p>\n<p>Every player starts with one planet and a small fleet. In every turn you may move every fleet one square (click on a fleet, then on the destination square and then decide how many ships to send there), if you end up on an enemy planet or enemy fleet a battle will take place after the movement phase. If a player retreats from battle he/she will lose 10% of the ships in the fleet and the remaining fleet will be withheld from play for between 1 and 4 turns. After the battle phase each planet builds it's allotted number of ships (home-worlds builds 15, neutral and captured planets builds 3-6 ships). After every fifth turn a status report is displayed. The score is computed as follows: 500/controlled planet, 50/explored square and 10/ship.</p>",

Airports is marked with an 'a' and an arrow that shows the direction on which planes are supposed to take off or land. Beacons are represented by '*', you can tell a plane in advance to do something once it gets to a beacon. The active list shows you what planes are in the air, their altitude, where they are heading and whether delayed commands have been issued. Under 'holdings' you can also see what planes are waiting at airports fore take-off.</p>\n<p>The game comes with 13 game files and since they are in plain ASCII (and explained in the manual) the player can easily construct his/her own game files.</p>",

Trying to move through a one-way path the wrong way will make the ball bounce. Hitting a key\nwill change the direction of a one-way arrow. Every level has a time limit so you can't think for too long before you move. You start with 3 lives and now and then you gain an extra life. The game is written in STOS.</p>",

You have to help this droid fulfill his workload. What you have to is assemble blocks (clacks) into the specific shapes required by each level. The required shape can be 3-in-a-row or Box for example. The game area consists of two 5 x 5 squares divided by the space where Clanker moves and new blocks appears. Speed is of the essence since being too slow will make Clanker lose efficiency points and if the efficiency points reaches zero it's game over. </p>\n<p>At the left side of the screen you can see how many clanks you have left to combine and at the right side of the screen you can see the efficiency-meter.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Clunk</em> is a puzzle game written in STOS. The object of the game is to clear 50 rooms of blocks as fast as possible. You control the droid Clunk and have to use him to move the blocks. To remove blocks you have to place two or more blocks with the same pattern (the game features 6 different patterns) adjacent to each other. Clunk starts every level with 500 power units which will decrease over time, if you complete a level fast enough you will be able to use the remaining power units to purchase a level password and if Clunk runs out of power units it's game over.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Firegame</em> is a board game for one or two players where the objective is to collect 16 house pieces (walls, rooms, roof and windows). Several dangers lurk along the way, fire being one of them. If a fire starts you need to extinguish it using a fire pail. If no player has any buckets the fire will spread and eventually destroy all of the house pieces. If a fire has been put out burnt house pieces must be doused with an extra bucket of water before they can be acquired.</p>\n<p>You start the game with $0. Every turn starts with a die roll then you move corresponding number of steps; if you land on a house piece you may buy it (if you have sufficient money), if you land on a fire bucket square you get a fire bucket, if you land on the fire square you start a fire, and if you land on a risk square you may choose to pick up a risk card. There are 15 different risk cards and they may have a positive or negative outcome. Every time you pass start you get $ 5000. A progress meter at the right side of the screen shows how far each player is from the goal.</p>",

For every alien you destroy the rest will move a bit faster. Now and then a flying saucer will move across the top of the screen, shooting it will give you bonus points. You have to watch out for the aliens lasers, you have three shield blocks that will protect you but they wont last forever.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Dark Wars</em> is an RPG that takes place in a large secluded clearing in the Invar forest where four towns lies. Clerics had long believed that there was something outside this clearing but other people rejected this as fairytale stories. But when one day contact was lost with the two southern towns some people started to wonder if there was any truth in what the clerics believed. Now war broke out between the two remaining cities, Swordsblade and Eaglesmount and the situation looked very grim for Eaglesmount. But the one night the Swordsblade army got almost annihilated, survivors told the citizens of Eaglesmount that an army of evil orcs from the south had attacked them. After the two towns agreed to cease the fighting an expedition was sent south to discover what had happened to the two towns south of the Invar river. For many weeks nothing is heard from the expedition but then one day a lonely soldier stumbles into Swordsblade and utter the word \"undead\" before he dies. In his possession a note is found that warns the two towns of a great evil to the south and forbids anyone to travel south of the Invar river. The elders ignores this warning and a reward of 20000 bronze pieces is offered to anyone that can find out what is happening to the south and this is where the player comes into the picture. As a poor adventurer living in Eaglesmount you accept the challenge and get ready.</p>\n<p>Before starting to play you need to generate a character; choose between four races: human, elf, dwarf or halfling and between four classes: warrior, magic user or thief. After you've generated your character you start the adventure in the easternmost town Eaglesmount. You now have to gain experience, level up, find other adventurers that want to join you in your quest and, when you are strong enough, journey south and cross the river to discover what evil lurks there. Traveling alone you won't get far so it is important to speak to other adventurers and try to convince them to join you.</p>\n<p>The game was written in GFA Basic V2.0.</p>",

In each level you have to defuse a certain number of bombs before you move on to the next level. The bomb timer starts as soon as the bomb appears in the level so the player has to act fast.

While picking up pieces of the rocket and fuel drums the player has to defend him-/her-self against an onslaught of countless aliens coming from the left and right.

The game uses a double nine set of dominoes (each rectangular tile has 0 to 9 dots on both long ends). One human can play against up to four computer opponents. The players takes turns placing one of their tiles on the table. Tiles must connect so that the dots on the edges matches. When a player can't place any of his tiles he has to pass. The game ends when a player has no more tiles left on hand or when no more tiles can be placed on the board, in the later case the winner is determined by the number of dots on the remaining tiles: the player with the least dots on his tiles wins the round.</p>",

The ship is armed with a laser so smaller walls can be shoot to pieces. Once the ship gets going there is no way to slow down.

        "description": "<p><em>Super Scramble</em> is a clone of Konami's Scramble with a few differences. As in the original game the player flies a space ship through a cave system filled with missiles that launch from the ground. But unlike the original game the player has to battle an end of level boss in the form of a space snake after each level (6 in total) except after the last level when the player has to battle the evil darklord himself. The ship is armed with a forward mounted gun and laser bombs. At the top of the screen the player can see number of lives left, score and fuel status. The player has to destroy fuel drums to keep his ship supplied with fuel.</p>\n<p>The background story is that the evil darklord Zargor has conquered the galaxy and that their are only a couple of thousand humans left. They have created a spaceship named Cobra so powerful that it can destroy the darklord himself and it is of course the players task to pilot this powerful ship.</p>\n<p>The game was created using STOS.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Verminator</em> is a platformer in which the player takes the control of Jake, an exterminator. The basic idea is that he walks and jumps through the game world and kills all vermin he meets. A radar routes him to the infested areas and teleports help to shorten the way. Every week, indicated by a time limit, he receives money for every killed vermin and the game can be saved. Said money can be reinvested in shops to buy useful items like weapons, extra lives or a permission to use the teleports. If money runs out, he can lend it at a bank in return to heavy interests. An alternative way to gain money is gambling in the casino.</p>",

The player controls a space ship, flies from left to right and shoots everything on the way; preferably without dying from collisions or enemy bullets. The standard gun shoots both forward and backwards and can be upgraded by collecting power ups on the way. The game uses a gravity system: the player always needs to counter steer st avoid crashing to the ground.</p>\n<p>Regarding power ups, the player needs to look out for symbols which have negative effects and should be avoided. Points for the high score list are also handled through power ups and shooting enemies rewards no points. Collecting an extra gives an automatic boost in one direction.</p>",

In the centered graphic window Marlowe's location is displayed, and in the aerial view floor plan on the right side the player can choose which buildings or rooms will be entered next. Along the way collected items can be managed in a graphical inventory and used when required.</p>",

If the ball goes past your bat then it's a life lost. To help you there are icons that fall downwards when certain bricks are hit. These can help you in your game and include shooting lasers, ball sticking to the bat and extending the bat. There are shapes floating around the screen and although they can't hurt you they can make the ball bounce in a new direction. One or two players can play and each player has a turn when the other player loses a life. There are 33 levels and the first 16 can be chosen to play.</p>",

The player indirectly controls the ship by issuing commands from the command menu. There are about 29 commands available, including using shields or special weapons. Inertia is simulated. On the map are also neutral objects which become hostile if attacked.</p>\n<p>In the last two scenarios, each war party gets a set amount of credits to build an army of ships. However, the player does not only buy pre-made ones, but gets to equip them manually. Each ship consists of a hull, pods and weapons, of course each with their advantages and disadvantages.

        "description": "<p><em>RoboCop 2</em> for the Atari ST, like other versions of the movie license on home computers, combines platforming action, a puzzle mode and first-person gallery shooting, but features unique levels and gameplay mechanics.</p>\n<p>The main attraction are the platform levels. The player controls RoboCop on his way to specific goals: the primary goal that ends the level is the destruction of the Nuke drug plant or the arrest of a major villain. Secondary goals include picking up Nuke drug canisters and arresting suspects like scientists or drug process workers. Making all arrests and finding all canisters is rewarded by extra lives. Robo's progress is hindered by hordes of respawning goons coming at him from all sides, attacking with guns and grenade launchers. His standard gun can fire only one projectile at a time, but hidden in crates or dropped by enemies are gun power-ups that include three-way and five-way shots, but all with limited ammunition. No matter the gun, care must be taken because firing rapidly can overheat the gun, requiring a cooling-down period in which no shots can be fired. Besides better guns, there is also an invincibility power-up as well as clocks that extend the time limit and glasses of baby food that restore Robo's health.</p>\n<p>After every platform level, a puzzle stage and a shooting gallery follow. In the puzzle stage, RoboCop tries to regain some of his human memories. To do so, a cursor has to be moved over a circuit board, with the goal of hitting all red chips. Moving the cursor leaves a trail, and neither the trail nor any chips besides the red ones may be hit or the puzzle game is over. Completing four boards in succession (each within less then a minute) leads to extra lives being awarded.</p>\n<p>In the shooting gallery, targets appear in windows and on the street, and a crosshair must be moved to hit them. But not every target is a criminal, and care must be taken so that no civilians are hit. Good performance at the gallery improves Robo's accuracy for the following level.</p>\n<p>The last level of the game returns to the platform game mechanics, but the only goal is to defeat Cain in his \"RoboCop 2\" form. This takes place over several screens, with Cain sometimes recuperating while sending smaller enemies like flying drones and ED-209 at RoboCop.</p>",

Lot's of enemies and traps make this a difficult task. Cannons are shooting at you, arrows are flying around, boulders dropping constantly and moving enemies have to be attracted to specific positions to pass. There are ladders and ropes to move around quickly, some bonus items giving temporary protection against certain threads (like boulders). Secret passages can be found and diamonds can be collected for additional points.</p>\n<p>Each level is a single screen, there is no scrolling. As the game is only running in high resolution (and monochrome colour) and unsing small tiles for the elements, these screens are packed with functional elements and therefore some strategic planning is required before starting to move.</p>\n<p>The game comes with an editor allowing the player to change all the existing levels or creating new ones.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Turbo ST is a racing game, which does not rely on hundreds of racing tracks, but directly booting into a track editor. You can change the two predefined tracks or create new ones. These can be loaded and saved as normal files, so are exchangeable easily. The track elements contain 45- and 90-degree curves, vertical, horizontal and diagonal lines.</p>\n<p>There are three themes to assign to the tracks, which alter the graphical representation in game: Rising Sun, High Noon and Alps. The graphic comes with occasionally zooming sprites beside the bitmap road, with the background picture scrolling left and right. There are no AI drivers, so playing the game alone you can only race against the high score.</p>\n<p>Up to four players can race against the time in a hot-seat mode on the created or loaded tracks. You car have four gears, switching up and down easily with the joystick. The score is always starting at 9999 and counting downwards with time and you also receive a penalty on the score for crashes.</p>",

The money is just there for some points, you cannot buy anything with it. With level 2 fantasy elements come in, two dragons are throwing bombs at you which you have to avoid. In two following levels you are on trails and have to jump on the other side to avoid obstacles.

        "description": "<p><em>Spacola</em> is a 2D space shooter. Like in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8872/asteroids/\">Asteroids</a>, the player's ship is pinned at the center of the screen, adding thrust scrolls the screen in one direction, and stopping must be done with thrust in the opposite direction. You can find some weapon upgrades like a twin shoot, you can shoot asteroids, and after destroying pirate vessels their pilots are crying for help and can be collected for points (the police is paying for them). The galaxy consists of 64 sectors and the beginning sector is always a different one.</p>\n<p>Your job as pilot of a space craft is to deliver different goods to a space station. But there are some problems: a lot of pirates are hanging around in the sectors, looking to steal the goods. And even worse: you do not know exactly which space station you are looking for and most of the stations are property of the pirates as well. As with the bad situation, from the outside these pirate owned stations are looking exactly the same as the civil stations. What sounds like a design flaw was part of the monetization of the game: the disk with the game was not only without copy protection, but it was allowed to copy it freely and therefore the possibility to spread it through Public Domain libraries. The star map, which lists the coordinates of the space stations to deliver the goods, was a book with 176 pages, and this book could be bought from Dongleware.</p>",

On touching regular stones, they reveal a symbol. You have to open two stones with the same symbol in a row to lock them. When all stones are locked, the level is finished. Therefore the goal of the game is the same as in Memory. Save controlling the ball, which can only be done with the mouse, in a world with ice on the floor, bumpers catapulting the ball in a different direction or with gravity spots attracting the ball, is very crucial element of gameplay, too.

The editor itself does not contain the game, therefore you still require the original game. A copy program can copy the original disk on which you then can replace the levels with the ones from the editor. The created disks can either be single sided (no music) or double sided (with sampled music).</p>\n<p>The user interface is quite slim: you chose actions with the keyboard, like scrolling through the levels with the cursor keys, selecting stones with characters and setting them with the mouse.</p>",

The player flies with his spacecraft with selectable acceleration, can move up, down, left and right, which causes the landscape also to scroll horizontally. The ship's defence is a single weapon, which is required to shut down energy barriers, turrets or moving enemies like flying saucers, which split into many smaller enemies on destroying, or to attack ships on the ground.</p>\n<p>The landscape itself is also an opponent, with walls moving periodically, having the player to tune the acceleration of the ship carefully to pass these obstacles. There is no score counter, the only purpose is to survive as long as possible.</p>\n<p>An editor is delivered with the game, allowing to create new fractal landscapes, modifying them, view in 2D or 3D, place ships and save/load the created levels.</p>\n<p>The game was released in the game competition on the Outline 2014 convention, winning the second place in that competition.</p>",

The asteroids of the original are still there, but they are in sphere form. On shooting the bigger spheres, they split in several smaller ones, often quicker moving. The bigger asteroids require several hits until they explode. Luckily, if the players ship is hit, not instantly one of the four lives is lost, but only some energy is drained, which can be refilled by an extra, which randomly appears as a collectible. Other extras rewarding a shield, making your ship immune to collisions with the enemies, or freeze all movements of the asteroids for a short time, making the removal easier.</p>",

Furthermore, whoever has tried to find out the secret of the odd, but influential, family has died in the process. Now, as an investigative reporter who has been a little to investigative, it is your turn to die. Attempting to thwart destiny, you enter the Agony manor while its owner is away for the night, attempting to unravel the Kruwehl family's mystery.</p>\n<p><em>Sheer Agony</em> is a graphical adventure made up of digitised stills, with limited mouse interaction. There are 15 point-and-click verbs at your disposal: go, open, close, look, probe, read, swallow, smell, press, turn, push, lift, search, take and put. Using <em>search</em>, you can find objects and pick them up, but your inventory is limited to 9 items, after which you must put down held items in the right spot, or relinquish them forever. The number of items per screen is small, but the manor is quite large and you must use the integrated map to find your way through each floor.</p>\n<p>Originally released in French, English and German for the Atari Falcon, <em>Sheer Agony</em> was also re-released in a cut-down version for common Atari ST computers.</p>",

Floating a small boat down a river, you find yourself attacked from all directions by aliens, dinosaurs, mines and everything else that can explode or fire projectiles. To fend for yourself, your craft is armed with a gun, and pods floating around in the river will also make your life easier. Pure reflex work is not enough to survive, as the current of the river will always pull you down the screen and slow down any movement. This, and the forced scrolling the game uses, may lead to situations where you are squashed between a rock and the top border of the screen \u2013 unlike most scrolling games, <em>Whitewater Madness</em> scrolls \"downstream\" instead of upwards.</p>",

In a split-screen view, you and a mate control a small rocket in a cramped cave system filled with traps, trying to hunt each other down. Each player starts out on his starting ramp (of which there in fact are several), which is also armed with an anti-aircraft gun that may be rotated at will as long as the rocket is on the ground.</p>\n<p>In addition to the one-on-one two-player mode, there is a \"race\" mode where the two players race around the screen, passing checkpoints along the way.</p>\n<p>For a single player, there is a \"seek and destroy\" mode, where all enemies on a level must be destroyed, upon which a port to the next level is opened.</p>\n<p>To make the game more long-lasting, there are several levels to fly around, and an assortment of different bombs and projectiles to arm the ships with, as well as an afterburner that can be installed in place of a weapon.</p>",

Those numbers can either be positive (red color) or negative (blue color) or neutral (the zero). Each time a number is selected, it is added to the score, so with negative numbers, the score can also decrease.</p>\n<p>The trick with the game is that one player can only move the cursor vertically (in the board column) and the other can only move it horizontally (in the board rows). If a stone is chosen and the according row/column is empty, a random new stone appears. This lead to games in which the score first raises for both players, as mostly positive numbers are picked and at the end of the level the score is decreasing, as mostly negative numbers are left on the board. A strict time limit on moves makes this a game for quick thinkers.</p>\n<p>The game features five levels with different background pictures and some special stones like random numbers in later levels.</p>",

Any field revealed shows the amount of bombs around this field. If there are no bombs surrounding the chosen field, all adjacent fields without bombs around are revealed. If there are bombs around, a number shows how many. On the square board this can be 1 to 8. If the player marks all bombs on the board, the level is won. It is lost if the player reveals a field with a bomb on it.</p>\n<p>There are two playing modes: in level mode the game is restarting with higher difficulty after marking all bombs on the board. \u201cFree\u201d mode is selected whenever the user sets own options like the board size or the amount of bombs planted. There are nine stages in \u201clevel\u201d mode, with an increasing amount of bombs, making the clearance of the board more and more difficult.</p>\n<p>Compared to many other Minesweeper clones, the default play-field size is very huge (38x28 tiles), which can be reduced in free mode.</p>\n<p>The game is only running on the Atari Falcon in VGA resolution.</p>",

They can transport rocks, grenades or the player upwards.

There is no limitation on the retries, and even if a time counter is ticking, no time limit is given. The player can freely skip levels without any cheat.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Racer 2 is the successor of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Racer\">Racer</a> released in 2013. Unsurprisingly, it is a car racing game. </p>\n<p>There are three playing modes: Championship, Challenge and Arcade. While in the Arcade mode the player is just driving for fun, in the Challenge mode the player competes with 7 AI controlled drivers for the win. Finally the Championship is a ongoing competition over all tracks with the ultimate goal to win the competition.</p>\n<p>Overall there are 24 tracks, with up- and downhill passages, with the later tracks have to be unlocked first on racing success in the competitions. The 39 different cars in the game are displayed as scaled sprites. Each track is featuring it's own music, while sampled sound effects are mixed in.</p>\n<p>Three difficulty levels are supported. The modes differ in the amount of time available to finish and the speed of the AI cars. Gear change can be optionally set to manual control, the default is automatically gear switching.</p>\n<p>There are random bonus items appearing on the road, which offer higher maximum speed, kick opponents from the street, flatten the tires of opponents, freeze the time, and even kicking other cars from the road on ramming them. For a more serious challenge, this bonus system can completely deactivated in the options.</p>\n<p>Exclusively running on the Atari Falcon computer, the game runs in high color mode (65.000 colors). The roads are texture mapped, but this can be turned off in the options for faster gameplay.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The exploration space vessel \"DARWIN 8\" is in troubles: it is invaded by alien robots, who killed the whole crew, leaving the player as last survivor to fight the intruders and clear the ship.</p>\n<p>The player blasts his way through 40 levels shooting robots. But there is a problem: the robots are protected by \"positronic generators\", which have to be destroyed before the moving robots are receiving damage from your weapon. With active generators, a hit with the weapon only stuns them for a very short time. In each level there is at least one of those generators, in others there are up to three. Clearing a level fast awards you with extra points depending on the time remaining, while running out of time is punished with a life loss.</p>\n<p>The levels are presented as single screens, with deadly walls in them: touching a stone instantly kills the player, which is also happening on a single hit from any of the robots shots. The level maps are pre-defined and always the same, but on each level start or dying, the position of both the robots and generator are randomly chosen. After each seven levels, the player gains an extra life.</p>\n<p>The game was published as cover disk for ST Format, but released into the public domain soon after. In 2010 an extended port with original graphics was released, named <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/48671/robotz-dx/\">Robotz DX</a>.</p>",

As aliens occupied the abandoned earth, The \u201cCouncil of the Confederation of Human Kind\u201d decided to send a ship to Earth to conquer the home planet again.</p>\n<p>Of course, the player takes control of that Battle Probe and fights his way through 65 levels to expel the aliens by simply killing all of them in this vertical scrolling shoot 'em up game.</p>\n<p>The player is attacked by shooting and moving aliens, but also must avoid any ground obstacle dropping a shadow carefully, because those will instantly kill the player. During the level the player's ship is consuming fuel, which has to be refilled by flying over \u201cFuel\u201d fields. On the ground there are also often colored eyes found: a blue eye rewards some extra points, a yellow eye rewards an extra life and a green eye releases a random effect. On collecting extras, the game is playing a voice sample telling you which item you collected.</p>",

Saving the world is practically done by solving puzzles. Those levels are divided into time zones, which does not affect gameplay, but graphics and music.</p>\n<p>In-game you control a cursor and move over stones. On leaving a field, it vanishes and you cannot go back. A level is solved as soon as all stones are removed. Therefore the route moving over the stones have to be carefully planned to avoid later inaccessible stones. Often there are several possibilities to solve the level. Some maps are taken from the earlier free Atari ST game, but there are many new levels added to the \u201cProfi Edition\u201d, overall 100 levels are included.</p>\n<p>There are several differences to the predecessor. Graphical wise, there is now variance in stone graphics \u2013 but only visually, there are no stones with special functions. By default the map is scrolling, keeping the player's cursor in the centre, which makes parts of the map invisible at times (this effect can be switched off in the options). Time limits are not so short like in the free game, but the player has to survive with only five lives instead of nine. A level password is now rewarded after each level. Overall playing speed is slower, for example you can not instantly restart the level on a button stroke if you are stucked, but have to watch and stop some animations first before re-entering the game.</p>",

Figures contain always three stones, are vertically and cannot be rotated (that means: they are only moving in the columns, hence the name). The stones themselves are in different colors and those colors can be rotated inside the three-stones brick by pressing the button on the joystick. The goal is to build rows, columns or diagonals of the same color with at least length three. The bigger the build formations are, the more points are rewarded.</p>\n<p>Vertical Mayhem features two playing modes 'Childs Play!' and 'Heaven and Hell' with different graphic sets and game difficulties. After a certain amount of blocks, the level increases in both playing modes and the speed of blocks dropping increases.</p>\n<p>The two-player mode of the original is not included in this variant, but a high-score table can be entered on enough points.</p>",

Depending of the color, there are different effects on the speed or control. While white and blue fields are nothing special, green ones are slowing your ball, yellow ones are accelerating it. A red field throws your ball in the air, allowing it to cross gaps in the road. Violet fields inverse the control (pushing the joystick to the left moves your ball to the right and vice versa). The \u201eroad\u201c is not the full six fields wide, as holes make it smaller or require it to jump.</p>\n<p>Each player has a limited amount of jumps, which can be triggered without a jump field and those jumps are badly required at certain level spots. Falling of the costs some time until your ball is placed back on the road and in full speed. If the end of the level is not reached in a given time limit time, the game is over.</p>\n<p>The game is always starting in two-player mode with vertically splitted screen, but progress of both players is independent, so a single player can continue the race if the second player is out, which is basically a single-player mode.

        "description": "<p><em>Sweety Thingies</em> is a conversion of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/74371/poux/\">Poux</a> by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Nick+Kouvaris\">Nick Kouvaris</a>. The game starts with four rows of candies representing different colors. After a short amount of time, another whole row of stones is added at the bottom, pushing all stones above one line further. The goal is to avoid that any column is reaching the upper border of the board. To do this, stones have to be removed by the player. Stones can be removed if at least two stones of the same color are next to each other. On removal, any stone of the same color with direct (non-diagonal) connection to any removed stone is also removed. Like in <em>Tetris</em> all stones above fall down into the now empty slots. Given that rule, often more than two stones are removable.</p>\n<p>The game awards removed stones with points and the level is increased automatically after a certain amount of rows is added. In higher levels, the amount of different colored stones is increased up to seven, making removal more difficult. Compared to the original game, the speed of rows added is much higher. Reaching a big score is rewarded with an entry in the high-score list.</p>",

The \"Deluxe Edition\" features the playing mode of the original and is adding another playing mode called \"Squared Frenzy\", extending the game principle of the original.</p>\n<p>In the <strong>Classic Kolmik</strong> playing mode, the play-field are three lanes filled with differently colored stones. Your goal is to create vertical columns with stones of matching color by shifting one of the three rows left or right by one stone. Removed columns are randomly filled. Each shift costs you two moves. By successfully creating a column, you gain an additional move (you can create more than one column by a shift). Classic Kolmik is a conversion of the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/74370/blix/\">Blix</a> by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/720623/nick-kouvaris/\">Nick Kouvaris</a>. In the <strong>Squared Frenzy</strong> mode a 8x8 board filled with colored stones is presented. You can create a vertical column, but also build horizontal rows are allowed. In this mode, you do not shift complete rows, but exchange two stones next to each other. In this playing mode, the amount of moves after successfully creating a column or row is set to the maximum.</p>\n<p>In both modes, no time limit is given and only the amount of leftover moves determinate the game's ending. Points are rewarded for building rows/columns, with a significant bonus if more than one are removed in a single move. There are two difficulty settings \"Easy\" and \"Hard\". In the more difficult setting, there are four different colors instead of three and the amount of moves is reduced compared to the easier setting. Separate high-score table for the modes and difficulty settings are available.</p>",

Waves of alien spaceships approaching from the top of the screen. Left and right the satellites weapons are positioned. If any ship reaches the line below the weapon, it counts as hit. Too many hits will loose you the game. You also have to keep an eye on the energy level of the laser, as any shot requires some of it. Some aliens can even shot, draining further energy.</p>\n<p>There are several options to adjust gameplay difficulty, like e.g. changing the speed of the alien vessels.</p>",

The goal is to build a continuous connection to the end point in the upper right corner.</p>\n<p>Sounds easy? Well, there is a constraint. The fields are in different colors. And the level is only finished, if you have an equal amount of each color connected. Sounds complicated? Well, an example: if there are two colors red and blue in the level, the line which connect start and end must cross the exactly the same amount of red and blue stones. In many puzzles there are much more fields of one color than others.</p>\n<p>A special stone is the gap stone, which does not count as color. With level progress, fields in up to six different colors are on the board and the board itself gets bigger. You must not include all colors, so if appropriate, in a three color level you only connect stones of two colors \u2013 if the amount of fields connected in those two colors are equal. There is no time limit and you have unlimited attempts to solve a level. The last solved level is also saved to disk, so you can continue a game without playing the earlier levels again.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Twix</em> is an implementation of the board moving puzzle known as <em>Khun Phaen Escapes</em>, usually manufactured with wood pieces. On a 4x5 board there are ten stones. Four small 1x1 pieces, four 1x2 pieces, one 2x1 piece and a single 2x2 piece. The goal is to bring the large square to the opposite side, which seems to be impossible first, as there are only two free fields to move and rearrange the pieces. Indeed this puzzle is not trivial, the common solution takes 103 steps, the currently best known strategy 79 steps.</p>\n<p>In the game <em>Twix</em> you have to move the stone from the left to the right by selecting the piece to move and then move it with the cursor keys. The implementation is quite special, as the game code itself is not executed as an Atari ST program, but as a program for the Hewlett Packard 48SX pocket calculator which is then emulated inside the ST game. This is visualized by a 48SX on the screen and all the action is only taking place in the small monochrome display of this picture.</p>",

The game is an extended remake of the type-in program <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Uncle+Henrys+Nuclear+Waste+Dump\">Uncle Henry's Nuclear Waste Dump</a> by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/45045/james-hague/\">James Hague</a> released in Antic magazine in 1986.</p>\n<p>The game is a puzzle game in which the cans of waste are falling from the top of the screen to the bottom and stacking up if other barrels are already present in the same column. <em>Nuclear Waste Dump</em> is reversing the usual scheme of color-matching used in related puzzle games: the waste bins are marked with four different symbols and your goal is to <em>avoid</em> the placement of similar marked barrels next to each other. If two of them are placed next to each other, the waste explodes and the game is over. The same happens if a stacked column reaches the upper border. The waste bins can be moved left and right, and they automatically fall down after a certain amount of time. This time gets shorter with progress in the game.</p>\n<p>There are some special stones appearing randomly: a bomb, destroying the stones around it, a freezing barrel will prevent surrounding bins from exploding even if they have the same symbol. Another special will destroy all stones in it's way falling down. A high-score list is kept in the game and saved on exit.</p>",

Pills are constantly appearing at the outside and moving towards the centre. The pills are colored in four colors, while the player itself is also having a color. Pointing to a pill with the same color in the direction of the player, the pill disappears. If the pill is having a different color, the pill is colored in the color of the player and the player gains the next of the four colors. </p>\n<p>The different playing modes are \"Continual\", in which the pills approach from an empty board. With certain amount of points, the next level is reached and the pills appearing in shorter time intervals. If a pill stack reaches the centre, the game is over. In \"Level\" mode you can decide yourself how fast the pills appear and how many fill the screen on the beginning. Finally \"Time Attack\" is starting with a completely filled board and you have to remove a certain amount of pills in a given time without any pills added.</p>\n<p>Three two-player modes are available in which you either play as team, or against each other or in a mode in a \"Combo\" mode. Team play is like \"Continual\" mode in single player mode. Playing against each other, one player can only remove pills at the top and bottom, while the other has access to left and right pills. If a pill is removed, it appears in the opponents area!</p>\n<p>With success you unlock cards, and a high-score table keeps track of your success.</p>",

For each level you only have a specific amount of moves to reorder the numbers.

This amount is increased in later levels or with higher difficulty settings.

It features both single and two-player game mode.</p>\n<p>In single player mode, levels are not increased during play, but are clearly separated: on finishing a level by reaching a certain amount of points, the board is cleared completely and the game increases speed of the stones. Also, from level 3, there are random stones placed somewhere on the board. Two player games can be played in the \"Normal\" mode, which plays like the single player game, but with the screen divided in two play-fields. The second two player mode, \"Tetra Kill\" is nasty: if a player forces his stone to fall faster (by pressing the joystick button), this is also happening for the stone on the other players field.</p>\n<p>A high-score table is present and can be saved.</p>",

Some of the destroyed asteroids leave small \"M\" icons, which represent minerals and should be collected. Minerals are the currency in the game world and can be exchanged for goods between the levels. The shop is entered after each level and is run by an unfriendly alien, but it is selling extensions to the laser weapon (e.g. longer or faster shots), a shield, or extra lives.

The addition of <em>Orb</em> are some convenient and innovative approaches of control: clicking left on a field moves the player to the spot if no box pushing is required to reach the spot. Double clicking moves the player to that spot too, and pushes any box in the way. Up to four positions can be saved and the player can instantly return to them with the function keys. These functions do not alter the gameplay, but do make playing the game much faster, as by manually moving the player's avatar in <em>Sokoban</em>'s levels sometimes require repetitive moving. Classic control via joystick is also supported as well as an undo function for the last move.</p>\n<p>The game is implemented as system friendly application, so it can even be played in a multi-tasking operating system. There are two zoom levels, so even on smaller monitors no scrolling is required (although the game can scroll the maps if required).</p>",

There are always two frogs competing and over three laps they randomly move forward (no user interaction is required or possible).</p>\n<p>The winner of the race is allowed to enter the \"Creature Power\" part of the game. In a guessing game you are confronted with situation which you have to solve by transforming in a certain animal.

The ships can be rotated. Unlike the original game, no gravity is taken into account. The big star in the centre of the screen, which was also present in the original can be turned off optionally, blocking shots and destroying any ship on collision. The second ship can be controlled by AI, so single player games are possible.</p>\n<p>An addition to the <em>Spacewar</em> design is energy management: either accelerating your ship and shooting the weapon consumes energy. If you have enough energy left, you can transfer energy to your shields protecting yourself or, if energy is running low and you require to flee or continue shooting, you can also transfer shield energy to energy.</p>",

For the first time in the series, the game is not only available in German, but also translated to English. Like in the predecessors, up to four players can manage a club in the first four leagues, participating in league and cup competitions (national and international).</p>\n<p>The graphical interface is much more colorful and more detailed information about player and team performance are shown, and the options to tweak the gameplay allow a finer control like in the former two games. For example you can set specific starting settings for your team and conditions for winning and loosing the game, like disabling the sacking because of debts, as well as the strength of leagues. You can choose the nation you want to play the leagues in, which is modifying player generation. Like in <em>Spitzenreiter 2</em>, the clubs are fantasy ones, but now they are assigned to a city, so now Liverpool is playing against Manchester, even if the clubs are called \"Rebels Liverpool\" and \"Mj\u00f6llnir Manchester\". For single matches, tactical formations can be set, you can set a motivation level for the game, bribe the referee or set an extra bonus for the players. Also, the training options are extended, you can either set the pre-season training schedule for six weeks and during the season the training for a single week. Games are still presented as series of the events like goals, but after the match a finer analyses of the game including individual ranks for each player, is shown. On the transfer market you can strengthen your team by buying new players or negotiate the contracts of the players of your squad.</p>",

In \"Solitaire\" mode, you simply can play without any time pressure while in \"Tournament\" mode you have, with increasing difficulty, between 12 and 4 minutes to clear the board. If you get any advice from the program to show possible moves, the high score is frozen at this time. If there are no more possible moves left, the game is instantly ended. You can repeat the last move. The high-score table is saved to disk.</p>\n<p>The game is running on all GEM machines, with tile sets in monochrome and 16-colors.

        "description": "<p><em>Galactic Empires</em> is a multi-player turn-based strategy game. Up to seven players compete to conquer the galaxy. Each player is starting on a home planet and a certain amount of ships. Each turn, the fleet or parts of it can be moved. Travelling to other worlds takes time, and reaching distant worlds may take several rounds. During each round, random events may happen, from pirate attacks or natural disasters, affecting one or more players and fleets. If a fleet is approaching a world defended by another fleet, a simply fight takes place without interaction: there is a random element involved, but generally the player with the bigger fleet wins.</p>\n<p>Being a plain multi-player game, the game offers to print the galaxy map upfront. This is handy, because the input of all players has to be typed in blindly (so no other player can see your commands). Commands are always encoded in three numbers: \"move X ships from world Y to world Z\".</p>\n<p>The size of the galaxy and the length of play in years can be set at the beginning. Games can be saved and loaded. There is no AI for single player matches.</p>",

In terms of gameplay both games play identical and feature the same modes for single player and multi player games. So, still the board have to be cleaned by connecting identical stones or stones from the same set, with a maximum of two edges in this connection.</p>\n<p>The successor differs in terms of game options and convenience. The user interface is more accessible, mouse and keyboard controls are added to joystick and joypad control, there are new graphical tiles, and more options are available than in the predecessor. Time limits and the amount of available help calls can be configured for each player, allowing a more interesting multi-player game if the skill of the players is very different. In single player mode you progress in levels after clearing a board, getting more difficult boards in the next higher level.</p>\n<p>A high-score table is present. The game runs in High-color mode on the Atari Falcon.</p>",

All extra-weapons are there, either the yellow and blue candy, the umbrellas, bombs, and bubbles shooting lightnings, as well as extra bonus point elements like the crown and others. Control of the dragons is precise and can be mapped on the keyboard, but also joysticks and joypads are usable. You can easily jump on your bubbles to gain heights. The famous \"Extend\" characters are available, and of course the white wale hunting you on taking too long is also available. On clearing a level there is a bit more time to collect bonus elements like in the original. The game is starting with four lives and seven credits.</p>\n<p>The graphics are in high-color mode (65.000 colors), so the original platform graphics is redrawn using much more colors. Sampled voices and effects are added as additional effects. A high-score table can be reached. Being a shareware licenced game, on registering the player got an editor, which can handle levels using the mouse, replace graphics. Also, the extension <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Double+Bobble+-+The+Further+Adventures\">Double Bobble - The Further Adventures</a> with 100 new levels was granted.</p>",

An addition to the classic game is the adding of teleporter fields: touching one of this elements, you are instantly ported to the other teleporter, which can be handy to trick the ghosts. Fruits, which are rewarding some extra points are randomly spawning at certain positions in the level. They award 1000 points, which is equal to the amount of points capturing all four ghosts with a power-pill. A high-score table is available and saved to disk. During the game, no music is played, but there are sampled effects.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Argon</em> is a room-based shooter which plays like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8147/cybernoid-the-fighting-machine/\">Cybernoid</a>. A spaceship has to be manoeuvred through a maze of single screens, which are flipped on reaching any border with a connection to another room. The ship can only shoot horizontally, but can turn inside the level so shot left and right. Moving enemies can be shot and transform into coins to collect. Rooms are guarded by either moving enemies on fixed flying paths and turrets, which fire in random patterns. Contact with any wall or obstacle in a level is, like being hit by any shot, an instant death. Occasionally there are shops in the levels which offer e.g. a bigger shot, missiles or a shield in exchange for the collected money.</p>\n<p>The ultimate goal of the game is to collect six green magic balls and find the exit of the maze, which is guarded by an end-of-level boss. There is no high-score table, but exploration progress is shown on Game Over.</p>",

The most significant update is that all texts in the game are in English language now, while the former game was in German only. Gameplay doesn't changed, wih playing is still traditional Mah Jongg with the \"Turtle\" board setup and many convenience functions.</p>\n<p>The two playing modes \"Solitaire\", with no time limit, and \"Tournament\", with different time limits, are accompanied with an off-line multi-player mode called \"Happening\". In this mode the game creates eight boards and the game saves those on any amount of floppy disks. Each player participating in the Happening is getting such a disk and can start the game using that disk. The game presents all eight boards with a time limit of 3 minutes for each, and the score for all is accumulated and the results are stored back on disk. According to the manual, the looser of the round has to invite all others to a Chinese Restaurant.</p>\n<p>Playing Mah Jongg often end in an board position where further progress in impossible. <em>Premium Mah Jongg II</em> now has a solver included that can determine if a certain position has a solution or you can even restart the same board and check if it is possible to be cleared at all.</p>\n<p>The UI was improved to support mostly any Atari video hardware and is now running even on graphic cards in very high resolutions. The high-score table was extended to 100 entries and there is an external conversion tool included on disk to convert the old high-score tables to the new format.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Only! Valency</em> is a puzzle game in which you have to reconstruct molecules. Each molecule is consisting of atoms in six different colors with connections to each other. On the lower border you have a strip with according atoms, which you can scroll left and right to select an appropriate color. You can only set atoms on spots connected to any atom already added to the molecule (and in each level at the beginning one atom is given). There are some constraints on adding atoms: beside a connection to an already added atom the nearest connection in the selected columns must be of the same color than chosen in the stripe below. Adding always go from the top to the bottom, and if any atom in the chosen column is lower than the free spot, this column is blocked. To reach free spots, you can rotate the atom in 90 degree steps and move the adding column left and right.</p>\n<p>The goal in <em>Only! Valency</em> is strictly time based and the game forces you to add the atoms as fast as possible by rewarding better times with higher scores. But you have to be careful: if you have chosen a wrong color or adding to a blocked column, you are punished with fault points. Also, in some situations, you have to add atoms from the left or right, which is valid, but also increasing your fault score.</p>\n<p>There are three playing mode: in \"Solitaire\" mode you have no time limit, but building the molecule faster gets you a higher score. In \"Tournament\" mode you have an overall time limit for rebuilding the molecule. In \"Fallout\" you have a maximum time per atom, which is reset after adding one atom. Both time limits in Tournament and Fallout can be chosen by the player. A high-score list keeps track of the players success. There are 300 levels which you can play in any order. Language in the game is either English or German.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Clogged up</em> is a moving puzzle game. On a 6x6 board your goal is to reach the exit with your clog shoe. It can only left and right and the way is blocked by many different stones in different lengths (2-4). All those stones can only be moved in the direction of their orientation, so some can moved up and down, others left and right (in later levels there are blocks movable in all directions). You have to move the stones until the way is free for your clog to move to the exit.</p>\n<p>There are six worlds with several levels to unlock, starting with a Dutch theme and an Atari theme in world two. Each level solved is saved so you do not have to play it again. There are no points, but \"loscores\", which are the amount of moves required until the level is finished. Also, if you only use the minimum account of moves possible, the score is marked as \"perfect\". For each level solved you get additional help calls, which can be used if you are stuck. In a two-player multi-player mode two identical boards are displayed beside each other and the players simultaneously try to make the position as difficult as possible. After a given time the boards are swapped and each player has to solve the position the other player set up. The faster player wins the round.</p>\n<p>There are high-score tables (or \"loscore\" table in this game), which are saved to disk.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Apparition Finder</em> the player works for the Inter-Dimensional Slime Fabrication Facility as the apparition finder. As the name implies the Inter-Dimensional Slime Fabrication Facility manufactures slime. Slime is stored in huge holding vats and the players job is to rescue ghosts that have been trapped in these vats. There are a total of 24 ghosts to save, 6 in each vat. The player moves the detector at the bottom of the vat and can shoot detector beams into the vat. When a beam hits ecto-plasm a ghost is restored and once all 6 are restored it is on to the next vat. Hitting a ghost twice is not a good idea, the beam will bounce back to the detector and then the player have to start all over again. Time is of the essence since slime is on its way to the tank and once it enters it the ghosts will die.</p>",

Movement cost depends on the terrain and mountains is impassable except for flying armies. Water may only be entered and exited by cities or by harbours. Own cities produces a certain amount of gold each turn and gold can be used for recruiting units to the armies or hire heroes. Battle outcome is decided by die rolls: both fighting units roll a 24 sided die and if the attacker's roll is higher than the defener's total strength and the defender's roll is equal or lower than the attacker's total strength then the defender takes one damage. Various conditions may give players bonuses in battles, for example if a hero is with the army it will be stronger. Cities can be defended with up to 32 different units. The game comes with two maps and a map editor. As for version 1.01 AI is not yet implemented.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mac Pan</em> is an extended implementation of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/138/pac-man/\">Pac-Man</a> idea on Atari ST computers with monochrome monitor. Like in the original game, the player controls a circled avatar trying to munch all dots in a level before getting caught by four wandering ghosts. On eating on of the rare power-pills, you can temporarily reverse this and chase the ghosts and kill them for extra points.</p>\n<p>The game features four different mazes, all with four power-pills and the possibility to transfer to the other side in the centre of the screen (you leave the screen on one side and enter on the other). On finishing all four levels the game continues in the first maze in a higher level, increasing the aggression and speed of the ghosts. The ghosts themselves vary and speed and follow slightly different strategies to hunt the player. After each 10.000 points an extra life is rewarded. Points can only be collected by eating points in the level and chasing ghosts with power-pills, there are no bonus items like in the original. </p>\n<p>The game has a flexible difficulty level: with a slider you can adjust the game's speed, which affect both the player and the ghosts. On very slow setting the game is far easier than with higher speeds. An unique extension to the <em>Pac-Man</em> theme is a temporary speed boost: by pressing the joystick button the player moves quicker for a short time period and so may escape the ghosts. But using this feature comes at a cost: after using the boost, you are slowed for the rest of the life or the level, whichever comes first.</p>\n<p>Two different multi-player modes for two players are available in <em>Mac Pan</em>: you can either play after each other trying to beat the high-score. The other mode is a simultaneous coop mode, in which both players play in the same level at the same time. Both players share the score and the live-reserves, so if the last life is lost, the game ends for both players. A high-score table can be reached and is saved to disk.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The \"Bouncing Bouble\" aliens want to conquer the earth. The player has to prevent this by eliminating all enemies with the \"Super Bouble Blaster\". <em>Bouncing Boubles</em> is an arcade shooting game inspired by early coin-op games like e.g. <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8402/galaga/\">Galaga</a>. </p>\n<p>On single screen levels, the player controls a small ship, which can be moved left and right and shoot straight up and is confronted with one or multiple enemies of four different types. The first two enemy types are bouncing, that means they fall down and bounce back up, but loose some height on each jump. The circle enemies have no weapons, while the other bouncing enemies drop mines. Both must be eliminated before they reach the bottom. Dropped mines explode at the ground and touching them before the explosion is completely over (indicated by an animation) is deadly. The other enemy types are shooting at the player, firing laser weapons if they are above the player's ship. The last enemy vessel type is the most dangerous one: it does not only shot lasers if above the players ship, but also throwing multiple mines diagonally.</p>\n<p>In the first levels all four enemy types are introduced, in later levels they appear in mixed formations with increasing numbers and with more of the more dangerous types. There are 40 levels to be played. On loosing a life, the current level is restarted with all enemies. For each 300 points the player is rewarded an extra-life. There are two playing modes controlling the difficulty: in the single shooting mode you have to press the joystick button for each single shot, while in the easier setting your ship's cannon is auto-firing while the button is pressed.</p>",

Every month the things to be done on certain days can be found in the diary. Every month usually starts with squad selection, except those in which there are a friendly game in then the player first have to choose which country to play against.

After that it is time to travel. The main game screen shows the current continent and a menu with 8 buttons: Home base, photo, money, time, game progress, Airport, travel and hotel. To finance the trip the player must take and sell photos. On the photo screen the player are presented with eight pictures (divided between two screens) and must click on the one that best resembles the place where the player currently is. If the player chooses to stay at a hotel he or she might meet a person that is willing to pay good for the right photos. Traveling is done by clicking on any of the available cities on the map screen. Visited cities will have a red outline around their names.</p>",

The more letters that are kept from the previous players word the more bonus points are awarded. After a player has entered a word it is checked against a wordlist (if the players has choose to use one) and if it isn't in the wordlist the player/players may choose if the word should be accepted or rejected.

Instead of giving your flats for rent, you can also hire some prostitutes and use the flat as a whorehouse. You can hire chemical staff to run drug production, install betting agencies and other non-legal businesses. If you hire some rowdies, you can send your gang for some protection money or directly to rob a bank. Finally, you can even send a killer to your opponents.</p>\n<p>Each month you can set up your things and after this turn, you get a report how your business is developing. There are random events, like the police arrested some of your employees and you can decide to pay the bail money or not. Those random events can be created with an external program in the game package. Games can be saved and loaded. The difficulty of the game can be set by the amount of money you have at the beginning.</p>\n<p>The game is only available in German languages and only runs on the monochrome monitor.</p>",

As in the original game, your goal is to become the local don in the criminal underground of a simulated city. In this trading simulation you can do some legal business, like trading houses, but you can also build drug labs into those houses, produce a lot of cocaine and hire some dealers to sell your stuff.</p>\n<p>The second <em>Mafia</em> game overhauls the user interface completely and is adding some new features, but the major part of the game remains like in the former game. A central office allows you now manage your employees. It is also the place new messages arrive, like you lost money on horse bets. You now have four direct opponents and between each turn you get information about their actions. You can hire informants to get more detailed information. Income from drug production and your dealers work on spreading those is now more clear.</p>",

The player takes the role of a team manager and has to set up a competing team with a limited budget. You can hire two drivers, buy tires and engines, and compete in races, which are shown as text results. Each type of car part is available in three different models, with different costs and performance. Between the races random events occur, which are sometimes positive, like you get a new sponsor which grants you money, or very negative, like you just bought the most expensive engine and it broke during the training. If you cannot afford participating in a race, because you do not have the required parts for two cars, your drivers are not starting and you do not get any positive effects. After the season you get an overall report and can decide to play again.</p>\n<p>The game is written in GFA Basic and only runnable on monochrome monitors.</p>",

The player takes the role of the club manager, who trades players and set some strategic decisions. For example, the amount of money to invest in your youth center can be set, as well as the amount to for medical services and public relations. Players can be traded freely. The players in the game do not have names, but values. The top players are valued 2.000.000, while a common player is only worth 250.000. Higher valued players propose better chances to win. Creation of the values of the player of a squad in the first place is mainly based on luck: for all the players in the player's team, a value between the lowest and highest can be played by a kind of slot machine. With very good timing this may be solved better, but in general it is random.</p>\n<p>The matches are simulated by showing the goals but without any possible interaction by the player. After each match day, the coach can dismissed, if the teams performance didn't matched the expectations.</p>\n<p>You can chose the leagues to play in from nine premade leagues in the beginning, but you can also create your own league and team with an external league editor program which is part of the package.</p>",

The knights can move two fields forward and one field to the side (in any direction).</p>\n<p>The goal of the player is to prevent that any of the pawns reaches the lower border.

There are different kind of cards, some giving you benefits like a demo tape or you can exchange members of your band.

Having the desired amount of members able to play a certain style, the band is playing this kind of music. With event cards, you can exchange the members of the band. Random events occur during the rounds, when sometimes a groupie destroyed your demo tape or somebody spend some money to the band.</p>\n<p>Having created a demo tape, a recording in the studio and visited a radio show, you can start to play gigs raising some money.

Each player has a shogun and seven pawns. The goal is to capture the shogun of the opponent player or decimate the pawns until a player only has a single pawn left.</p>\n<p>Moving is quite different from chess: each figure has a number printed on it which represents the amount of fields this figure must pass if moved. A figure can move horizontally, up and down and it is possible to change the direction once in a move (e.g. a pawn with number \"3\" is allowed move two fields up and one field to the right, but two changes of the direction like one right, one up, one right are forbidden). After moving a figure on the board, it randomly gets a new number between 1 and 4. Each figure can hit any other if the move ends on the field of the opponent figure.</p>\n<p><em>Shogun</em> can only be played with two human players. The game prevents the players from making illegal moves. The figures can be moved with the mouse simply by dragging them to the destination spot.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Bert bought the helicopter of Ralph and modified it. The player somehow has a gun and is heading for the park to shoot the helicopter. Two years later, Bert takes revenge by attacking Earth with the help of a mad scientist. In <em>Bert Games</em>, the story does not matter.</p>\n<p>The game is consisting of two arcade games. The helicopter part is a clone of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Duck+Hunt\">Duck Hunt</a>, in which you point to the helicopter and shoot. The cross-hair is controlled with the mouse. On hitting the helicopter it crashes to the ground. You should avoid the falling helicopter to hit Bert, who is standing in the lower right corner. If it hits Bert, the game is over. After using all your munition and Bert being still alive, the game is switching to the second part.</p>\n<p>In Bert's revenge for destroying his helicopter, he attacks Earth with laser weapons which must be defended in a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9177/missile-command/\">Missile Command</a> clone. With the mouse you can drop bombs which destroy any laser beam in that area. If the attacking beams reach the town, you loose energy. The game ends if you have no ammunition or energy left.</p>\n<p>The game has a high-score table and is only running on the high-res monochrome monitor. All the in-game texts are written in German.</p>",

In this snake-like game up to three human players move their snake-head across the level keeping a trail of their previous route behind them. A collision with either the own tail, the tail of another player or any obstacle in the level kills the player. That player last-standing wins the round. The obstacles and starting positions are randomly placed at the start of each level.</p>\n<p>The amount of blocks (obstacles), the amount of players and the speed of the head moving can be manually configured.</p>",

On the ground there is a cannon with constantly rotating angle. On firing the cannon, a ball enters the field and bounces off any wall or circle in the level area. If the ball comes to rest, it gets a random size and number between 1 and 3 printed in it. Hitting a circle decreases it's number and removes it from the field if the number reaches zero. If the ball shot crosses the line above the cannon, the game end (which happens after is bounces off from circles in the level). With each shot and bounce you earn points.</p>\n<p>The game runs in any resolution and there is a binary for Coldfire-based Atari machines added. The game is written in C and the source code is included.</p>",

In the arcade game <em>Bunion Canyon</em> up to four players take one of the characters and try to reach the highest platform. The platforms are moving horizontally and at certain positions there are holes, and often those holes are changing in size during the move. Any of the four avatars can move left and right and jump. If jumping is timed perfectly a higher platform can be reached by jumping through a hole. But beware: you fall down if a hole in your current platform is moving under your feet. In that situation it helps you can run out of the left or right border and re-enter on the opposite side.</p>\n<p>As the plain jumping challenge would not be enough, the gods added blue pills, randomly appearing in the levels. Those grant one of four powers to the collector, like a wind to throw opponent players away or to lock them down temporarily. Also, in most levels a hammer is marauding, disabling any player it touches. Disabled players also fall through holes down.</p>\n<p><em>Bunion Canyon</em> is always played with four competitors, but the computer can control any amount of them (even four). The amount of rounds to win for an overall win can be manually configured.</p>",

You control a balloon moving through a underground maze, desired to collect all stars in a room. Accelerating the balloon gives it an impulse and it will not instantly stop, which makes navigation tricky. Any contact with the walls will blow your balloon and a life is lost. As if the navigation would not be difficult enough, there is also a strict time limit for collecting the stars. The player has three lives. If loosing a life, the collected stars are now respawned, but the time limit is not reset completely.</p>\n<p>The game was created during a 24-hour game creation competition at the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Reservoid+Gods\">Reservoir God</a>'s Cwmvention party in 1998.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Static</em> is an implementation of the card game <em>Patience</em>. But: it comes with a twist: it is not only the slow single player game to relax, it is also a hectic competitive multi-player game for up to four players, coming with extensions to the card game. The goal is to finish your four piles before any other player do. As there are some bonus items, you can encourage to finish faster than your opponents, or hinder the others to finish or even steal their cards.</p>\n<p>The basic rules are like in the traditional Patience: each player has 7 columns with cards faced down and a deck. Any card at the end of a column or top of the deck can be turned face up. Turned up cards can be stacked by their number, but only if they have opposite color (a black 4 can be added to a red, but not to a black 5). By reordering the columns, additional card become turnable. Fetching an ace opens one of the four top piles, in which the sequence ace up to king of a single color must be laid down. The game is finished if all four kings are on the top piles.</p>\n<p>The specialities of the multi-player games separates <em>Static</em> from other Solitaire games: in the deck jokers are hidden: in general you play joker cards on a single opponent. Some prevent the player from drawing cards, lock piles for adding cards and other affect your control of the game like slowing the pointer or even invert the controls. The \"Metamorphis\" joker let you take control of an opponent player's deck for a short time, letting you cause havoc there. The game offers to take control of any of the players, so as a single player you can play up against three computer controlled opponents.</p>\n<p>The game's is highly configurable: for every single of the dozens of extras the amount of appearance can be set (or turned off). The playing strength of the AI can be configured in three levels. Four different graphical sets can be set for each player, the controls can be defined on the keyboard (if not using mouse, joystick or jaguar joypad), music and effects can be configured. The game is featuring a graphical high-score table.</p>",

Frogs are standing at one side of a road and want to reach the other side. Carefully jumping up and down the frog can change the lanes on the road, avoiding the many cars driving on it. Cars are not simply passing by with a constant speed in this game, but also accelerate or get slower on occasion.</p>\n<p>Beside converting the original game, <em>Bugger!</em> adds different playing modes: after setting a time limit, the goal is to reach as many points (road crosses) as possible. Another mode is limited by the amount of lives: cross the road as many times as possible before until you died for the specific amount of times. The speed of the frogs can be adjusted in three levels: slow, medium and fast. In a multi-player game, up to six human or computer controlled frogs compete with each other. Three frogs are starting at the lower side of the road, three on the upper side. The player with the most points scored according to the chosen playing mode wins. Extensively (and morbid) statistics of the frog's death are shown after each game. A high-score table can be reached.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Power Up Plus</em> is the enhanced successor of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Power+Up\">Power Up</a>. The racing game is inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/2302/super-cars-series/\">Super Cars games</a>. The racing track is viewed from the top and is scrolling in all eight directions. Playing a season, a sequence of tracks has to be solved and points are rewarded for the position the player is reaching at the end of the race after three rounds. Collecting enough points to reach the top of the league after the season is the ultimate goal of the game. There are four different track sets: Mini, Easy, Medium and Hard, which basically are separated by the length of the track. The driving skills of the computer controlled opponents can be switched in three levels from Easy to Hard.</p>\n<p>The races are spiced up by the weapons each player can use: each car can shot to the front and leave oil to disturb following cars. If hit by either shot or oil, the car is uncontrollable for some moments. The usage of weapons can be turned off in the options. In two player mode the screen is split horizontally, giving both players their own view of their current position on the track. Like in the normal game additional computer opponents are on the street and the season is played. Two additional multi-player modes are implemented: in \"Duel\", the game's view is a single window. If one of the cars get behind and is getting out of view of the area the leader sees, the cars are set back and the behind player is getting a penalty. The other multi-player mode \"Duel Special\" is featuring the same rules, but additional computer controlled cars are on the streets.</p>\n<p>The game runs on any Atari ST system but is using practically any additional hardware possible (blitter, STE sound) and even can utilize exotic hardware like the MV16 and Replay Pro digital sound systems. A track editor is included with the game, allowing to create new tracks in a convenient way.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Zwyrds Doppelkopf-Programm</em> is an implementation of the German card game <em>Doppelkopf</em> (Wikipedia entry with the game description and rules). Unlike most other card games, the official rules are not widely accepted and each local playing round is choosing from a wide range of additional rules, scoring system and even the type of cards to play. In general, <em>Doppelkopf</em> is a game for four players and two players form a team, but the teams are not known in advance (in a normal game the two players with a Queens of Clubs on hand play together), creating diversified games and tactics. The game is played with 40 or 48 cards, with each card contained twice in the deck. There are a plethora of special rules and modes, some played as \"solo\", in which a single player plays against the three others (in many different variations), others appear if certain conditions are matched (like a player has only three trumps (\"Armut\") or holding both Queens of Clubs (\"Hochzeit\")).</p>\n<p>The accurate computer game implementation allows a single human player to play with three computer controlled players. Many of the special rules can be configured: the game allows playing with nines (48 card deck) or without (40 card deck). The actions on holding both Diamond Aces (\"Schweine\") can be configured as well as the many different extra-points to get during the play. The types of \"solo\" games can be configured and by default the trump game, Queens, Jack Solo, No trumps (\"Fleischlos\"), or even King-Queens-Jacks (\"K\u00f6hler\") are integrated. Players can make calls (to increase points), and the game is showing the current amount of points made during the round, as well as the information currently available (who played a Queen of Clubs). The amount of rounds and even the type of scoring can be configured. Special rules in which new cards are instantly distributed (like a player holding five kings or a no trump above a certain card) are implemented and can be configured, too. The strength of the computer AI cannot be configured and is not flawless, but in general the playing style of the computer opponents is very competent. Extensive statistics about the games, reached points, special points can be shown and a gaming session can be saved and continued later.</p>\n<p>The game is programmed in GFA Basic and the source code comes with the game. The in-game language is German.</p>",

To start moving into life, the player has to roll a six on the dice. If doing so, the player is set on field number 6 (\"delusion\"). Moving on the fields is straight: you roll a the dice and move forward by the number of fields. The ultimate goal is to complete the circle and reach the field 68 again. On the board are also two types of line connections between fields called \"snakes\" and \"ladders\". Entering a field being a starting point of one of those two lines, the player is directly moved to the ending field of those lines. Snakes are negative effects and move the player to a field below on the board, while ladders are shortcuts to fields with higher numbers. If a player if walking over field 68 (e.g. from field 64 with a six), no further movement is possible until this player is rolling the number to reach field 72 (\"Tamoguna\") exactly and then reenters the board.</p>\n<p>Each field is entitled with the names from Harish Johari's book and the game creator advises to read the comments in the book on entering a field (those texts are not included in the game). Games can be loaded and saved. Dice rolls can either be simulated by the computer or the value of a real dice can be entered as number. All in-game texts are in German language.</p>",

But those crystals are spread across the area, which scrolls smoothly in eight directions: to reach those, you have to utilize platforms, but also rely on \"jumping bubbles\". Touching those bubbles, you are accelerated and shot a small way up in the air, reaching further diamonds or the next jumping bubble. The bubbles disappear after contact, but respawn short time after that, so you can reach upper parts of the level again. There are metal spike blobs in the level, which have to be avoided, as they drain some energy from Roger, but crash on contact too. Two special items can be found: extra energy and extra time. The last one is required, as the levels feature a strict time limit. If either time or energy reaches zero, one of the initial three lives is lost.</p>\n<p>After finishing a level bonus points for the remaining time is rewarded. A high-score table can be reached. On the game start, a trainer can be activated, enabling unlimited lives and disabling the time limit on the levels.</p>",

Some cards can be found directly on platforms, other are hidden behind one of the nine magic doors, which are also acting as teleporters to other locations of the game map. The player can jump and should avoid spikes on the ground as they drain energy. Energy can be refilled by some of the bottles lying around (not all regain energy). If energy dropped to zero, the game ends. Beside finding all the cards, there are also 273 gold coins spread over the complete map, which can be searched and collected for points.</p>\n<p>There are no enemies or moving obstacles in the levels, so exploration of the levels can be done without fear (except the spikes). The player can change between Sissy and Sassy during the game, as well as saving and loading games. A high-score table can be reached and is saved on disk. On STE machines, a sample is playing in a loop.</p>",

And, being a god, this is also a threat to the Alliance, which rules the galaxy. To get a picture of the situation, the Alliance decided to bring in an agent first before starting direct military intervention on Tafoi. </p>\n<p>In <em>Fate Master</em> the player controls commander Tsin-Fei to gather information and preferably solving the situation on the planet without military strike. In the flip-screen landscape the commander can discover and collect items, enter doors, and approach enemies. On contact with enemies the game flips to a fighting screen, in which the player can attack or flee. On attack, one of the equipped weapons like pistols or grenades, can be used and in turns the player and the enemy attack until one of the fighters run out of hitpoints. Defeating an enemy is rewarded with gold, which can be used at a vendors to buy new or better weapons. The character has four stats: hitpoints, strength, skill and defence, which are automatically increased if the player reached a new level. On re-entering a room, previously killed enemies respawned.</p>\n<p>NPCs give the player quests, like finding a person or special items, reaching certain places, in which often certain items are involved (like you need dynamite to open a blocked door). Games can be loaded and saved.</p>",

The player starts with a small farm house and one piece of land with pigs. Each square of land can be used to grow five pigs, so extending the farm can only be done by buying land, which is very expensive. Food is consumed each turn, resulting in constant costs. Income can only be generated by selling pigs, but there are turns in which no demand for pigs is on the market. To increase the demand for meat, you can advertise in different forms for different prices. If pigs are getting ill, a doctor can be called to cure them.</p>\n<p>On the same map, a computer controlled player is also building his farm in direct competition to yours.</p>",

A timer to the right of the play area shows the players how much time there is left of the game. This game is a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/76948/megamix/\">Megamix</a>. The scoring is a bit more complex than in the previous game: the score depends on the tiles that are matched. Tiles have roman numerals on them and the player receives the sum of the as points: matching 'IV' will give the player 8 points. There are also Three special pairs: \"*\" which will double the score for the player, \":\" which will divide the other players score by 2 and \"SWAP\" which will swap the scores of both players.</p>",

As in the original game the player must eat all of the small yellow dots to complete the current level. The player must avoid the ghosts that tries to catch Pacman, touching a ghost means losing a life. Eating the bigger yellow dots makes the ghosts edible for a short while. If the player eats an edible ghost extra points is awarded. Now and then bonus items will appear in the middle of the level, these awards the player with extra point if eaten. Playing in classic mode shows the game area with traditional graphics, in modern mode the level graphics have been overhauled. Setting the speed to hectic gives the player an extra challenge since everything moves faster in that mode.</p>",

Without much thinking Alvin accepts the quest, it's just collecting a lot of valuable loot and bring it to the chancellor, how hard could it be?

The energy bar decreases over time and if the player is hit by fire. Energy platforms spread out through the caves can be used to fill up the energy bar. Here and there in the caves the player will be faced with passages blocked by energy beams. These beams can be switched off by firing at blue switches (these will then turned red). Firing at a switch will give the player 50 points, rescuing a scientist will give the player 100 points. At the end of each cave there is an end of level boss. Defeating this boss reveals a teleport that will take the player to the next cave.</p>",

But as it turns out, the wizard has disappeared and his tower has become home to many evil creatures. </p>\n<p>The local population tells the player that many have entered the tower in search of riches but few have returned. The player now stands in front of the tower with one thought in mind: to retrieve the great wizards spell books. </p>\n<p>In the beginning, the only thing the player is carrying is a spell book and a dagger. How much the player can pick up is limited by the player's strength and the objects weight. When the player adventures in this game it is important to keep an eye on hit points and power. Once the hit points reaches zero it's game over, and if his power reaches zero, no spells can be cast.</p>",

The king gives the player the mission to retrieve the gem of far seeing. The gem was stolen by the mad priest Alazar and so far 20 knights have tried to get it but all of them have disappeared. </p>\n<p>Before the player can start to play, a character must be created or loaded from disk. A character is created by letting the computer randomly generate values for: Physical, Mental, Toughness, Agility, Persona, Gold, Life points, Protection and Magic points. The game interface consists of three areas: the dungeon is to the left, to the upper right is the command menu and to the lower right is the status display. Once the player has spoken to the king and stocked up he/she must venture into the labyrinth that leads to Alazar. Killing monsters will reward the player with experience points and gold. </p>\n<p>The player is free to return to the shop area whenever he/she wants to spend his/her hard earned gold on supplies and better equipment. If two players play, they have to be careful since they can hurt each other. </p>\n<p>The shareware version came with a pre-designed labyrinth. Upon paying the shareware fee the player got a version that could load and play any dungeon created with Dungeon Construction Set.</p>",

Groups of three vertically aligned blocks fall from the top of the screen and the player has to guide them to the bottom. The aim is to match three or more blocks of the same colour which can be done vertically, horizontally and diagonally. As matches are made the blocks disappear and others fall down which can lead to chain reactions. While the blocks are falling the player can move them left and right, switch their order and speed up their descent. The goal of the game is simply to get the best score but as time progresses the speed increases. The game ends when blocks reach the top of the screen.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Seven Little Horror's is a public domain German language role playing game. You control a party of three monsters, out of a group of 10, who roam the country-side visiting villages/dungeons trying to collect seven objects and one key. Obtaining these allows your party to begin the decisive battle of the game.</p>\n<p>At the start of the game, each character in the party is chosen to be male or female, along with a race (Waxor, Gnome, Orge, Hunch, Megrim or Thauma) and a class which dictates magic preference. A number of statistics are then randomly assigned based on this information. Vitality relates to the base damage a character inflicts per round. Hit-points is the damage the character can take. There are also spell-points in six different types of magic: Psychic, Vampire, Magic, Devil, Voodoo and Banshee. Only magic is used in combat, and different opponents will be sensitive to different types of magic.</p>\n<p>The party begins on an overworld map which shows 19 villages. Some of these allow your party members to heal, to level-up, to save the game or to exchange characters. There are also dungeons labeled \"Level 1\" to \"Level 10\" according to the dangerousness of their inhabitants. When these are entered, the perspective changes to a first person perspective in a 3D maze. These mazes may be navigated by clicking in the direction of movement. Clicking on some portraits on walls reveals secret passages, and landing on some squares will rotate the party. In the \"Level\" dungeons, an auto-map in the top left side of the screen updates as you move.</p>\n<p>Combat can occur randomly on the overworld map, or at specific locations in the dungeons. A picture of your opponent is shown and only a single player character can engage in combat per round. There are three main options. To greet the monster, to run from it, or to attack with one of the six magic types. On attack, spell points are deducted and the damage inflicted is related to the spell points left, the character's vitality, susceptibility of the monster to that magic type, and a race or class bonus.</p>\n<p>After each battle, loot (gold-pieces) is collected. Experience points are also assigned to the combatants, with the character striking the killing blow receiving the bulk of the points. At regularly spaced intervals, the players can level up which increases vitality by one with more substantial increases to maximum hit-points.</p>",

Each week there is a match and on given weeks this is a cup match. The player starts in division 4 and the aim of the game is to move up to the top of division 1 by winning matches. If the team preforms badly there is a risk that the team will go bankrupt and that means game over.</p>",

The player have three tires and if enough score is generated during those three tries a place on the high score table is earned. If the player manage to only have one marble left on the board the game continues to the next level (there are a total of 25 levels in the game). Removing marbles is done by selecting a marble move it over another marble (horizontally or vertically) to an empty spot, on the easiest level this will remove the marble that was moved over but on harder levels the marble may change color instead and must be moved over one or more times with marbles of different colors before it is removed from the game board. The marbles can be of up to five different colors. Sometimes the player may add extra marbles to the board to make it possible to remove marbles.</p>\n<p>The game comes with no instructions whatsoever so part of the challenge for the player will be to discover what rules governs the removal of marbles. The game Features four game modes: Practice, Beginner, Advance and Tournament, it also has.</p>",

If a player rolls a six and can't use that six he/she gets a new roll. Marbles may be passed on the game board as long as they are not your own. if a player lands on a light blue circle that player may take a short-cut directly over the board the next turn. If a player happens to land on another players marble that marble is said to be captured and is sent back to the base.</p>",

It is your job to catch 930 mice, while avoiding angry cats, owls, tin-men and other combatants, whose attacks will lose one of your five starting lives. You will also lose a life at the slightest touch against a vertical wall or a low roof, but can fall any distance without harm. Extra lives, represented by hearts, can be found scattered throughout the levels.</p>\n<p>Mickey can move left and right, and jump. You can also do these things while bent low to the ground, allowing you to capture the mice in tight spaces. Despite being able to jump, Mickey tends to get between platforms by using elevators, or trampolines which provide much more sudden shift to the platform immediately above him. Police boxes appear on some screens, which allow Mickey to teleport to other more distant parts of the maze.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Conquest of Elysium</em> is the original fantasy turn-based strategy game that spawned a long-standing <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game-group/conquest-of-elysium-series\">series</a>, as well as the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game-group/dominions-series\">Dominions spin-off</a>. It can be played against one or more AI opponents, or between several human players at the same computer. Staring with just one castle and a group of followers, each player's goal is to vanquish all opposition and become the sole ruler of the realm of Elysium.</p>\n<p>In many ways, the game is similar to other fantasy turn-based titles like Steve Fawkner's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/warlords\">Warlords</a> or MicroProse's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Master+of+Magic\">Master of Magic</a>, but offers considerable depth and variety by introducing a vast array of different factions, each with their own unique playing style. These are split into several categories: Warlord, Magic User, Priest or Non-Human, the latter including such fantasy races as trolls, elves, dwarves and so on. While the economy based on taxes and the recruitment of forces into the player's military is the same for all, faction specifics come heavily into play early on, and building up an undead army of a Necromancer for example is not remotely similar to the more straightforward approach of a Human Warlord.</p>\n<p>There are pre-set scenarios, but games can be also played on randomly generated worlds that the player can customise by specifying map size, terrain features and the historical period (from early agricultural society to an empire and later monarchy). In addition to the warring players, there are numerous neutral entities that roam the world, from wild animals to brigands to fortified towns and villages. There are seasonal cycles that affect the game world as well: the population will be more cheerful in spring but much less so with the coming of winter. All these features contribute to a dynamic world in which the events of the game unfold.</p>\n<p>On the whole, <em>Conquest of Elysium</em> has only minor differences from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/64930/conquest-of-elysium-ii/\">its direct sequel</a>, which is essentially an updated port to IBM PC compatible platforms. However the latter introduced many changes to art (e.g. replacing almost every static screen), the interface design and layout, and tweaked certain playing mechanics. Several new player classes were also added, and some existing ones were changed compared to thefirst game.</p>\n<p><em>Conquest of Elysium</em> was marketed as shareware, with the unregistered demo version only allowing to play games on customised random maps, with some player classes not available for selection by human players. The save/load game feature was also disabled.</p>",

        "description": "<p>After a magic-war between good and evil, good has lost. The remaining good wizards have been turned into owls. The only way for the wizards to regain their non-avian form is to travel through time and across continents to collect some magical boxes and take them to the \"Cave of Eternity\".</p>\n<p><em>Wizard Royal</em> is a platform puzzle game. There are twenty levels supplied with the game, each containing four or five screens. There is also an in-built level editor. Every screen contains some combination of fixed platforms, ropes and vines for climbing up or across, and water and vegetation which slow your progress. There may also be moving platforms, traps of various sorts and enemies that may block your path or shoot flames/projectiles at regular intervals. Transporters are located on each screen, allowing you to travel to the previous or the next screen.</p>\n<p>You control a wizard owl as he wanders between the screens from the selected level. One of these screens will contain an entrance to the \"Cave of Eternity\", which needs to be opened with a key. Magical boxes lie scattered about on most screens. Once collected, these boxes may be deposited in the unlocked cave at any time. Carrying many boxes at once will cause your owl to slow substantially, so it may be a good idea to get rid of them as soon as possible. Some boxes are difficult to get to, and may require you to use a magic spell to blast a hole in the platform immediately behind you. But be careful this doesn't leave you trapped. Other helpful items include time bonuses, and armor which allows you to pass some traps unharmed.</p>\n<p>You start the game with five lives. These may be lost by getting caught in a trap, running into an enemy, or having to restart a screen after getting stuck (after which any blasted sections of platform get re-filled). Losing all lives, or allowing your time to run out will lose the game.</p>\n<p>The game was released in both high-res monochrome and low-res colour formats. The colour version also comes with additional digitized sound effects.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Das Grosse Deutsche Ballenspiel (or DGDB) is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Gauntlet\"> Gauntlet </a> variant with a few modifications such as the ability to throw bombs and traps such as lasers. There are a total of 23 levels with the original game. Each level consists of a number of screens, and the aim is to get from the letter A (your starting position) to the letter Z, without running afoul of the prowling monsters or laser cannons. The game can be started from any level as selected on the opening menu.</p>\n<p>As in Gauntlet, many of the levels are populated by monsters spawned by generators (or \"heads), and the only way of stopping the flow on new monsters is to destroy these. You also have an energy level, which is depleted by running into monsters. If your energy gets below zero, you run into one of the insta-death traps, or you accidentally blow yourself up with explosive, the game ends. But before this happens, you have the option of replenishing your energy a limited number of times.</p>\n<p>The game can be played in 1 or 2 player modes. In 2 player, both characters play at the same time. If one dies, the other can revive him by shooting a heart. DGDB was originally released in the public domain, but the level and character editors for the game were sold separately.</p>",
