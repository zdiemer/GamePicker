        "description": "<p>The objective of <em>Rolaball</em> is simple: Move your ball on the isometric landscape guarded by baddies, pick up the crosses and go for the exit. After you clear the first few levels, the game becomes more involved, with each level having several exits, some of which teleport you between different platforms without any natural collection. Though this might look and sound like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Marble+Madness\">Marble Madness</a>, that is not the case, since the ball is moved in steps between tiles and without any inertia.</p>",

As you fly, missiles will fly up from the ground to intercept, but they can be shot down. As you shoot, you also drop bombs, which allows you to destroy the fuel canisters planted on the ground, and thereby replenish your energy supply. A further distraction comes in the shape of bars that block the cave. You must shoot holes in the bars to pass through. Everything scrolls at a high speed, which makes for very hectic gameplay.</p>\n<p>The game features a very small sprite, only one character tall, four-colour graphics and a title screen with sampled speech.</p>",

Unlike <em>Zaxxon</em>, you are flying a helicopter, and this game entirely lacks the concept of height above ground. Any shots fired will hit whatever it crosses, be it on ground or airbourne. You also have your fuel level to keep an eye on. By shooting canisters marked with an F, you replenish your dwindling fuel supply. Failure to do so results in game over, and so does the loss of your three lives. The game plays entirely in black and white high resolution mode.</p>",

This version has a range of options, such as two collision detection schemes, variable size of bricks and paddle, background music and speed. The game is executed entirely in low-resolution graphics mode, which might explain the unorthodox collision detection; you will find that your ball might dig a path straight through the entire brick wall in one bounce.</p>",

Your plane travels across an undulating landscape where aliens sit at the ground. You can strafe down and shoot them on the ground, or wait until they lift off and fly into your line of sight. Your beam is short and thin, so precision is required in order to hit them before they fly into you. The game starts off in four-colour mode, then switches to black and white high resolution mode, possibly to simulate night flight. Three game speeds are available, and the screen scrolls fast, even at the slowest setting. Unlike the vast majority of games, it scrolls from left to right, instead of the opposite. Due to the use of analogue joysticks, and the speed of your ship, there is a lot of inertia in your control, which feels more realistic than the straight course in which you travel in other similar games.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Total Eclipse</em> takes its basic concept from <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Elite\">Elite</a></em> (which was never ported to the Dragon) but moves focus from real-time space flight to the trading and navigation aspects.</p>\n<p>The game is played through a series of graphical menus, joined by 3D and 2D action sequences. It takes place in a universe made up of 12 galaxies divided into 10 sectors of 36 cells (a total of 4 320 cells). Despite taking place in space, the galaxy map is two-dimensional. The cells may contain empty space, space stations, planets, asteroids, hypergates, black holes and abandoned space cruisers.</p>\n<p>You start out on a space station, which offer refueling and repair as well as investment services (recommended only for rich players). Planets vary in technological level and political system. Travel to anarchistic planets should be avoided by inexperienced players. Though all planets offer trading and refueling facilities, services such as repairs and spare parts (as well as the kind of spares) are dependent on the technological level of the planets. This also governs the range of goods on the stock market, and their prices. Asteroids can be mined for asteroil, a sought-after substance which may be traded at stations. Hypergates facilitate travel to other galaxies. Black holes are generally dangerous and should be avoided, though the manual hints at other possibilities. The abandoned space cruisers may be visited for claiming salvage money. To do so, you must enter the ship, find the bridge, take the captain's log, and return to your ship before the self-destruct sequence is activated.</p>\n<p>Using the short scanner, you may scan 36 cells in your vicinity and identify their contents. Each scan uses up your computer energy level, ultimately leading to operation failure. It is therefore necessary to reload your computer just as you refuel your ship. Upgrading the RAM of your ship computer activates the long-range scanner, which enables a longer scanning radius and hence a longer operation radius, since all travel is initiated from the scanner menu. A further RAM upgrade opens up the data scanner menu, which can scan an entire galaxy at once.</p>\n<p>When you reach a planet, pirates may try to extort you for protection money. Failing to pay may incur pirate attacks in space, which are fought out in a 3D view where you move your crosshairs to try to shoot down the attacking ships. In case the enemy is at an advantage, you can try to out-run them, or alternatively attempt a panic hyperjump, which moves you instantaneously to a random position elsewhere in the galaxy, with a chance of survival of 66.6%. Destroying a pirate ship will release its cargo into space, which will be transported to your vessel.</p>\n<p>Due to space constraints, the system of Total Eclipse can't be described in further detail, though it is at least as involved as <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Elite\">Elite</a>.</em></p>",

        "description": "<p>From <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=MicroDeal\">Microdeal's</a> budget label comes a maze exploration/survival game with similarities to older arcade titles. As you start the game (after the title screen which plays a rendition of <em>The Entertainer</em>, the screen quickly flashes an overhead map of the five levels of a dungeon, after which you find yourself at the middle level. </p>\n<p>You move your character in block increments through the dungeon, with the objective to find nine pieces of an ancient shield that are scattered throughout the five levels. You are working against time, since a gauge on the right side of the screen is running down, which can be interpreted as oxygen supply, stamina or a simple time limit. When the gauge is depleted, you lose one of your three lives. Another way to lose a life is to run into one of the blobby monsters that wander around in the depths. Fortunately, you are not unarmed. If you find yourself on the same horizontal level as a monster, you may fire your boomerang, which bounces back to you after hitting a monster or a wall. This is especially powerful in case the maze is filled with monsters, since the boomerang may very well take down several at once if they enter the right level at the right time. However, the boomerang can only be fired horizontally, not vertically.</p>\n<p>The game offers the usual Dragon colour selections: Black and white, buff or green.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Jump Jet</em> let's you fly the pride of the British navy, the Harrier VTOL fighter, across sea and land in order to fulfill a dangerous mission. The game plays in a side-scrolling shoot'em'up fashion. After lift-off from your base, your plane is attacked by enemy planes which must naturally be shot down. After crossing the sea and the mountains, you must attack a fortified island. Unlike normal sidescrollers, your plane actually flies faster than the chunky scrolling, making it reappear at the left end of the screen once it has reached the right side. An indicator at the bottom shows the status of your mission, whereas scores, levels and munitions levels are accounted for at the top. Much of the game is written in BASIC.</p>",

In fact, this blatant copy even plays the theme from <em>Star Wars</em> on the title screen.</p>\n<p>Since there is not much point in steering your ship while it runs down a straight trench, you instead control the crosshairs of your gun so that you can shoot down the TIE fighters that come flying in your opposite direction. The first fighter waves leave you alone, but soon they start to fire at you. When you encounter the hole in the trench, you must shoot into it \u2013 not in order to destroy the Death Star, but so as to replenish your shield energy. Two gauges on the screen show your remaining energy level and the distance to the next hole.</p>",

Another obvious influence is that the areas of the game are named after letters in the Greek alphabet. One trait that sets <em>Lucifer's Kingdom</em> apart, however, is that you collect crystals (xtals), which is done by repeatedly shooting the bricks marked C until they give away and release a crystal.</p>",

You can shoot in the horizontal direction in which you are pointing, but turning from left to right or right to left takes time due to the inertia of the fluid which seems to make up the screen. You also need to compensate for gravity now and then, or you will sink to the bottom. The bottom, like all other edges of the screen, is deadly and will burst your bubble. Prolonged contact with the creatures will have the same effect. Each screen is started out on your base, where you can sit, protected by a forcefield, until you find the right time to leave its safety, or until the field runs out of force.</p>",

This means that you will have to find all the necessary keys for locking up the exit, and these are spread all over the maze, of which only one room can be seen at a time. Try to find the map, it will facilitate easier navigation, but each time you look at it time will run much faster, giving you a lower score. The maze is filled with certain dangers, in the guise of snakes which will eat you alive if you startle them. Try to avoid their rooms, or cross them quickly when they turn away from your direction. Finding items such as keys, food or maps will keep your willpower up.</p>\n<p>The game runs in medium resolution in four colours and features a 3D animation top view of your character as well as animated sequences between levels.</p>",

You first find yourself represented by a small character on a map of the school, and must go to the entrance of the school office to get a pass, after which you are free to move from room to room.</p>\n<p>Moving between rooms, while searching for clues, means pressing keys representing directions. Each room is illustrated using character block graphics, and some have special functions, such as the music room, where you can play notes on the keyboard, or the lunch room where you can eat. Moving around in the school without seeing the map can prove quite disorientating, since moving north and then south doesn't necessarily mean that you will end up in the same place.</p>",

Another obstacle are the animated doors which open and close. As you progress through the game, the motifs change.

You must collect a set number of crystals to clear a level. The level wraps around at the borders, so it's easy to get lost.</p>\n<p>As you dig through the earth, you must watch out when you pass below boulders, since these can drop down at you. If there is a mass of boulders, you can start a rockslide which can very well kill you. On the other hand, these rock slides are often a necessity if you are to reach crystals jammed between the boulders. Digging the correct canals to channel the boulders into is an essential part of the game's strategy.</p>\n<p>The game runs entirely in monochrome high resolution mode and allows you to play against the clock and choose levels with some freedom.</p>",

There is a moving gap in each floor for Boris to fall through, so that he can reach the exit at the bottom of the screen. Boris must walk to the hole or wait until it reaches him, but waiting can be dangerous, since there is a bouncing ball hunting him. As if the ball wasn't enough, there are additional nasties patrolling certain floors back and forth, and batteries which will fire at Boris if he remains in the same place for too long.</p>\n<p>Boris has no offensive measures, but he can \"hyperjump\" to a random location on the floor he is standing on, or alternatively to the floor immediately above him. Due to the random nature of the hyperjumps, though, Boris can end up straight next to another enemy.</p>",

The graphics use a semigraphics mode, with the falling blocks rendered with a special striped effect to achieve unusual colour tones. A bit of sampled speech is also included, with the game proclaiming \"Tetris!\" when you eliminate four rows at once. High scores can be saved and loaded to disk.</p>",

        "description": "<p>You are a helicopter pilot sent out to rescue survivors from a troop ship crashed into enemy waters. The game is made out of two screens.</p>\n<p>The first screen plays like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Asteroids\">Asteroids</a>, without the splitting asteroids. Shoot down enemy ships and avoid their fire, while you look for survivors. The men don't show up on the screen, instead you have to follow the coordinates at the bottom of the screen. When in the vicinity of the correct coordinates, press the S button, and you reach the second screen.</p>\n<p>The second screen is seen from the side, your helicopter hovering above the sea surface with a ladder hanging out to pick up the floating men. The waters are patrolled by a man-eating shark, though, so hurry up or it will be well-fed. You have a small number of bombs that you can drop on the shark.</p>\n<p>The first screen is played with the keyboard, whereas the second uses the joystick. Both use four-colour medium resolution graphics.</p>",

You have a laser turret on the ground, as the sole line of defence against incoming ballistic missiles. Using the joystick, you must guide your cross hairs at the warheads and push the button to shoot them down before they hit one of your six cities. Your aim must be exact to hit the missiles themselves, and more points are awarded for more exact hits. High scores give you extra cities, and the game is over when all are destroyed. Somewhat strangely, even missile hits on the grounds of a destroyed city counts, which will lead to game over even when there are cities remaining.</p>",

You move your little man around on a screen populated by a few spade-like mushrooms, when from the borders, a snake slithers onto the screen. The snake steams straight ahead until it bumps into a wall or a mushroom, in which case it makes a turn. You can shoot the snake and make it disappear, but only if you hit its head, which requires precise timing. If you wait for too long, more and more snakes enter the screen, and sooner or later you will collide with one of them, and it's game over.</p>",

At the start, the difficulty and length of the game (determining the size of the galaxy) can be selected. The player then takes command of the starship Enterprise, trying to eliminate a specific number of Klingon ships using phasers or photon torpedoes. Phasers have three different range settings, the longer the distance, the more energy is consumed for a shot. Movement at impulse speed is done with joystick control, the keyboard is used for command input. To travel to different quadrants faster, the warp engines are used. The scanners of the Enterprise are limited in their capabilities, to get information about the contents of a quadrant, a hyperprobe may be launched if necessary. In addition to friendly starbases which can be docked for faster damage repair and supplies, a quadrant may also contain hazards other than the Klingons, like black holes.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Eddie Steady Go!</em> is a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/25077/back-track/\">Back Track</a>. After having escaped the labyrinths of Back Track, Eddie once again finds himself in trouble as he is recaptured by the mad professor. The professor has built a 22 part obstacle course which Eddie has to make his way through. The game consists of 22 single screen platform levels and the objective is simply to move Eddie from the left to the right side of the screen without being killed \u2014 very much like <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/23031/hunchback/\">Hunchback</a></em>. The controls are simple as all Eddie can do is move left, right and jump. The player has to watch out for arrows, rolling boulders, falling rocks and other objects that instantly kills Eddie when making contact. Eddie can also die by falling too far. </p>\n<p>Once all 22 levels have been completed the game restarts at a higher speed. There are three speeds so the total number of levels is 66. The player earns points as he make it through the levels and can get bonuses by picking up and eating apples. After 10,000 points or completing all 22 levels extra lives are earned. From the start the player has nine lives.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>UXB</em> the player is given the task of defusing an old unexploded war-time bomb. The game is menu based and played with keyboard. First the player has to choose the right items from his toolkit. Due to limited space in the vicinity of the bomb he can only carry six of these twelve items: small spanner, copper hammer, cold chisel, special fluid, sidecutters, stethoscope, socket set, pliers, hydraulic jack, special spanner, insulating tape and small screwdriver. If the player picks more than six items the bomb will go off right away. There is no way to dump an item so it's necessary to pick the right ones from the start. Before starting to work, the bomb can be examined from three views: side, nose and hatch.</p>\n<p>When working on the bomb the player is presented with a menu of five options (for example move bomb or unscrew nosecap). The player has to pick the right option and then the right tool. Picking the wrong combination leads to the bomb going off while picking the right one leads to the player advancing to the next menu (with new options) and everything repeats until the bomb has been defused. If stuck the player can type HELP to get a hint on how to proceed. When the bomb goes off the player is given the choice to restart from the last move or from the beginning.</p>",

The spell of the castle is tied to a rock and to free the maidens George has to use his sword to cleave the rock. The rock is located in the bottom left corner of the screen and to reach it George must use a bridge to cross a river. At the same time it's necessary to avoid or kill the fire breathing dragon that is hunting the hero. Getting hit by the dragon's fire or running into the water leads to a life being lost. Once the rock has been hit by the sword the level is completed and the player earns one point and moves on to another level which works exactly the same way.</p>",

After starting out, the skier automatically descends down the slope and the player's control is limited to moving left and right with the joystick. The aim of the game is simply to earn points by skiing through the slalom gates that appear. The slope has two different obstacles that have to be avoided: tree trunks and rocks. A game can be played by one or two players who each make five runs. Hitting an obstacle causes the current run to be abandoned. At the end of the fifth run the player with the highest total score wins.</p>",

The player is in control of both the hen and the farmer. The screen consists of five platforms that the hen can walk across and fly between. On the left side of each platform is a nest box and to the right there is a corn tray. The hen automatically lays an egg when moving over the nest box and pecks corn when next to the tray. Pecking corn restores the energy level of the hen to prevent it from starving to death. On each platform is also a hole that a fox can enter from. The fox has to be avoided or it will kill the hen.</p>\n<p>On the sides of the screen are two ladders that the farmer climbs up and down. The player doesn't directly control the farmer but can open flaps on the sides of each platform. If the farmer passes a nest box with an egg that has its flap open, he will collect the egg and transport it to the right side where it is dropped into an egg box. The farmer also refills the corn trays from the ladder on the right side but only if the right flap is open. If the farmer doesn't collect an egg quick enough a chick will hatch and start pecking away at the nearest corn tray. The chicks too can get killed by the fox.</p>",

The player is in control of a lander whose task it is to land on the planet Zyphon where it has to collect fuel. The player is dropped from a mother ship at the top of the screen and has to navigate through an asteroid field with the aim of landing on one of three pads on the surface. While moving down thrust controls are used to steer the lander and slow down its descent but if to too much thrust is used it will run out of fuel. After collecting the fuel the player has to fly back up to the mother ship. While doing so it is possible to shoot and destroy the asteroids. Lives are lost when crashing into the ground or the asteroids or when missing the mother ship.</p>",

The aim is to collect ten flags that are scattered around the maze while avoiding the AI controlled cars that chase and attempt to crash into the player. In the maze, there are fuel tanks that need to be collected or the car's fuel might run out. To delay the chaser cars, the player is able to release smoke from the exhaust. The amount of smoke that can be used is dependent on the level. There are ten levels, with later levels featuring more cars and boulders blocking the path. The game ends when the player has run out of all three lives by crashing or running out of fuel.</p>",

Finally the player has to enter the Castle of Doom which has another 27 locations.</p>\n<p>Like in other text adventures the game is played by entering verb noun commands. When entering a location the player first sees a full screen view of it and upon pressing the space bar a text prompt appears where commands can be entered. On the text screen the player can also see directions that can be moved in as well as objects that can be interacted with. All objects are randomly places around the locations. Using the look command redraws the image while the listen command gives information about the location's sound. If stuck, a help command can be used for a hint.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Sporting Decathlon</em> is a sports game that involves competing in all the ten events of a real decathlon competition: 200 metres hurdles, 100 metres, javelin, 400 metres, shot putt, pole vault, high jump, 1500 metres, discus and long jump. The events are played in order and for each one points are earned with medals being awarded at the end. All events are viewed from a side view perspective.</p>\n<p>Running is done with two buttons (speed up and slow down) and a third button is used for jumping or throwing. In running events the player has an energy rating which is not allowed to reach zero since the race will then be abandoned. A high pace leads to more energy being burned and therefore it is necessary to not run faster than what's needed to win the race. Throwing events only involve holding down a button to set the strength and then release it at the right time. The jumping events are all about pressing the button at the right time. In each event the player only gets one attempt.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Strategic Command</em> is a strategy game for two players that is played on a map with five islands. Each player has three bases which produce units: an army base, a naval base and a capital. The army and naval bases can only produce their own kind of units while the capital can produce both. To win the game a player has to take control of the capital of the enemy.</p>\n<p>The game is entirely played with joysticks. Holding down the fire button passes control from one base to another and pulling the joystick and pressing the button produces a unit that corresponds to the direction of the pull. There are sixteen types of units and they are deployed in task forces of up to three units. Task forces can then be moved around the screen and when getting close to an enemy combat will occur. Each unit has an attacking factor and a defensive factor. Each attack will cause the defensive factor of the target to decrease with the attacking factor of the attacker. When it reaches zero the unit is destroyed.</p>\n<p>Each player can lay mines through special units, one naval and one army, which each can lay two minefields. An enemy unit that moves over a mine will be completely destroyed. Mines can be removed by moving a minesweeper over them. There are no air units but air power is represented by the ability to reconnoitre enemies. This option appears occasionally and allows the player to see the composition of a task force.</p>",

The game is divided into 12 buildings: 10 of which are pubs, and 1 diner and your home. Each building has an entrance, and the goal is to visit every pub, drink a pint, and return home safely without getting hit by the cars that move vertically or arrested by the police officers who move laterally. Every pint drank makes the game move faster, but this can be slowed down by eating at the diner. If the player returns home safely, they head out for another night of drinking with faster moving dangers. The player starts with 3 lives.</p>",

Played on a 10 x 10 grid, the player slides a pointer along the sides of the grid, and can push that row or column away from the pointer, with blocks looping back from the opposite side. The goal is to move items, especially the ruby, to the box located at the top left of the screen. A line with a snake, guard, or ruby can not be pushed beyond that special character. Guards and snakes move about occupied spaces and chase after the ruby. Guards tend to protect the level exit, while snakes follow rapidly after the ruby. If the ruby is captured, it's returned to the starting square. Mines move about empty spaces, and blocks, including those containing snakes or guards, can be destroyed by moving them into a mine. The mystery box provides bonus points if moved to the exit point.</p>",

Between them, they control the Galaxy's prime source of Cetite ore, the fuel for hyperspaceships. The Barons run their planet on feudalistic lines. Their employees, known as servitors, have few rights and no freedom outside the confines of their master's Baronial lands, but they are well paid and well treated. A servitor can easily make his fortune in ten or fifteen years of adult service, after which he is retired to a planet within the Federal Democracy.</p>\n<p>The player receives a message via vidphone from their employer Baron White. He is concerned that Baroness Black has been experimenting with the Juxtaposition, a line of dimensional instability that passes through Ceti V. You are tasked with gathering the trust of the other seven Barons by travelling to their fortress and completing a task for them. Then, the player can infiltrate the fortress of Baroness Black, to defeat the Baroness' plans.</p>\n<p>All commands are via VERB NOUN entry, and game play is divided between exploring the planet's surface, where all locations are graphically displayed on the screen, and entering locations, where the game reverts to text adventure. All commands are via VERB NOUN entry, and there is a save/restore feature.</p>",

The player is attacked by slow moving alien ships which when hit become briefly vulnerable.  During this time the player must pick them up, or else they become rapidly moving dangers that veer directly towards the player.  When in their fast moving mode, the player can shoot these vessels again to reset them to vulnerable.  The player starts with 3 lives, and must defeat a set number of enemies to progress to the next level.</p>",

They might encounter the Smoochers, in which case the player has 3 tries to correctly guess the right number from 1 - 10.  Failure to do so loses the game.  If encountering the Wiggles, the player has 2 tries to guess a number from 1 to 6, and is given a hint after the first number if it's higher or lower.  The Yerkles sends the player to an arcade sequence where they must navigate through a moving passageway.  The player may encounter gold, the Bird of Paradise who offers clues, or may find one of the black pearls.  If the player can recover all 3 black pearls they are victorious.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Chocolate Factory</em> is a 2 - 6 player business managerial game for the Dragon 32.</p>\n<p>Each player takes control of a chocolate factory, with the goal to make and sell chocolate bars for profit.  The goal is to make the most money after all turns are spent, reach $10,000,000, or to be the last company to remain in solvency.  Each player starts with a net worth of $50,000; a factory worth $20,000 and $30,000 in cash.  Each turn, the player is given a prediction of total market size and total chocolate making capacity of all companies.  The player can spend money each turn to increase their chocolate bar making capacity, and the player must spend on overhead and the cost of warehousing unsold chocolate.  The player must also purchase vans to deliver chocolate bars, which have an initial cost, running costs, and a limited lifespan.  Staff must be purchased to sell chocolate bars, and advertising can also be purchased.  Negative events like fire and accidents can occur, and the player can buy insurance to cover these potential costs.  At the end of each turn, interest is charged on a negative balance and paid for a positive cash balance.</p>\n<p>Numerous gameplay options can be set, including: market prediction accuracy, interest rates, inflation levels, strikes, absenteeism, boom market, heatwave problems, and cocoa supply problems.</p>\n<p>At the end of each turn, the player's total expenses and profits are calculated.</p>",

Things haven't been so ripping since the nubile Cynthia Smythe-Drongo ran off with that Spaniard from Llandudno. After all, apart from playing a mean pair of castanets, what could he offer that the Vole-Strangler empire couldn't?  Still, no point in worrying about it, there are more important problems to consider. For example, what to do until the launderette opens? Of course, the very thing! Why not pop out and find the HOLY GRAIL? It won't take long to get there and back again.</p>\n<p>All locations, directions, and items are displayed on the screen, and all commands are entered via typing VERB NOUN commands.  The player's health and current wallet is also displayed.  There are 5 levels of difficulty, and the player can encounter random combats.  During combat, the player and enemy take turns attacking, and if the player loses they are sent to the hospital.  There are also random events like alien abductions and police encounters which move the player on the map.  There is a save/restore feature.</p>",

It is the maiden voyage of the luxury liner <i>Pacific 1</i>. Amongst the passengers is His Royal Highness King David, whose security is the player's responsibility.  Five days into the voyage, miles from the nearest shore, the player receives a telegram that the fanatical Mr. Sinister has brought a bomb aboard the vessel and disguised himself as a passenger or a member of the crew.  To save the king, crew, and passengers, the player must find the bomb, the room where the detonator is planted, and identify Mr. Sinister.</p>\n<p>The goal is to successfully identify Mr Sinister, which of the 25 rooms on the <i>Pacific 1</i> has the bomb detonator, and what item is masquerading as the bomb.  The player travels between 25 rooms spread over 5 decks of the ship.  All commands are via text input, and the screen displays the deck, location, objects and people in the room, and items and people being carried.  There are 2 separate programs with different rules: a single player version where the player has limited turns to solve the puzzle, and a mutliplayer game where the first person to solve the puzzle wins.  The player can carry 1 - 2 items and take a single person with them.  The player can encounter an assassin, and if they don't have bullets, it's game over.  Once the player has determined the crime, they can accuse by being in the correct room with the correct person and item.  If they are incorrect, the game is lost.</p>",

The Enterprise is equipped with short range scanners which show items available in that quadrant, and long range scanners which show presence of items in surrounding quadrants.  The player must track their energy levels, which are used for phasers and propulsion, and their shields which protect from enemy attack.  The helm is used to plot course and move within or between quadrants.  A limited number of torpedoes can assist with destroying enemy vessels.  Ultimately, the player can choose to self-destruct to prevent their vessel from falling into enemy hands.  </p>\n<p>The player can choose from 5 difficulty levels, and set their own self-destruct code.</p>",

There are a total of 100 levels and the player must navigate lifts, slides, collapsing and electric floors, moving platforms as well as the rock-dropping vampire bat flying across and guarding the exit. Egor, the evil doctor's willing slave, has been sent to make sure Frankie never makes it, as he scales the sides firing lightning bolts at the player. Frankie is equipped with a laser to neutralize bolts and other baddies that bounce about the screen, but this drains the player's rapidly depleting energy.  If energy reaches 0 the player loses a life.  Frankie starts with five lives in total.</p>",

Not an easy thing to do, especially when everyone is out to stop him.  Yobbo can move laterally and headbutt a short distance ahead.  He can also jump between platforms and to a great height, and the height of his jump is indicated by a small indicator at the bottom left of the screen.  The longer the jump button is held, the higher he jumps from 1\u20138.  If Yobbo hits the side of any objects or hits his head, he loses a life.  The goal on each level is to defeat all the enemies by headbutting, and collecting all of the acorns.  All enemies must be destroyed before the last acorn is collected.  The player starts with three lives.</p>",

Suddenly, they are surrounded by killer bugs which charge directly towards them.  In the house are giant bug eggs, and the bugs can be killed by pushing an egg towards them.  Each wave has new bugs, but fewer bug eggs.  The bugs can also eat the eggs if they walk across them, and the player can be left without any eggs to defend themselves.  If an egg is pushed against a wall or another egg, it is destroyed.  Starting on level 3, there are bug nests, which must be avoided or destroyed.</p>",

The player gains points for each letter captured.  Each game has 10 stages, and each stage includes five runs through the asteroid field to pick up letters.  The points awarded for letters decreases with each run through the asteroids. If the player hits five asteroids it's game over.  An additional version of the game has beacons which reward points if collected.  There are five levels of difficulty which control ship speed.</p>\n<p>In <em>Moneybags</em>, the player moves a hat laterally and tries to gather money bags that fall from the sky.  If a moneybag is missed it stays on the ground.  If any pile grows four bags tall it's game over.</p>",

The player has six arrows that they can shoot into an adjacent room with the goal to kill the monster.  Arrows will also eliminate goblins.  If the player fires into an empty room the location of all dangers are rearranged.  If the player walks into a room with a danger it's game over.</p>",

At the beginning of combat the wizards' mana levels are displayed, and each player can choose a spell from four possible choices.  The choice can be hidden or shown to their opponent.  The game then goes to the duel display, where each player can launch their offensive or defensive spell.  An animation of the attack is shown on the screen.  A player with low mana can choose not to attack, and if both players choose defensive spells, the round is void.  Spells require a varying amount of mana, and some spells can be steered on the screen to engage the opponent.</p>",

The galleon moves by travelling 1\u20134 leagues per turn, and can travel in the cardinal directions.  The seas are dotted with islands, harbors, enemy pirate ships, and Xs which represent the edge of the world.  </p>\n<p>Every turn the player can take a view from the crow's nest which shows the nearby 12 x 12 area, move their galleon, receive a report from their 1st mate on the status of their adventure, take a nearby view from the deck, fire their cannons, or rest. The ship status is represented by the number of men, cannonballs, guns left, and sails left.  Ship resources can be replenished by maneuvering next to harbors.  The player can fire in the cardinal directions, and must choose the distance to fire and how many cannons to use.  Each cannon shot uses precious cannonballs.  The ship can take damage on rough seas, running into islands, or taking fire from enemy ships.  The player receives a final score based upon the success of their adventure.</p>",

When monsters are trapped, Albert can defeat them by hitting them on the head with his pickaxe.  </p>\n<p>If he leaves a blott trapped in a hole too long, it escapes, becomes a bogle, and moves faster than before.

The distance their ship can travel each turn is determined by the number of sailing men aboard.  The galleon is controlled by selecting what direction to move on the compass.  During the voyage the crew must remain fed.  To engage in combat, the player must move their galleon on the same square as their enemy.  The ship with the most fighting crew is the winner.  Pieces of eight are used to buy crew and gamble at the islands.  Food, men, and treasure can be purchased by visiting the different ports. Treasures and gold can be stored at the home port so it can't be plundered or lost.  The player with the most treasure at the end of the game is the winner.</p>",

The player has limited fuel which is used for movement and deeper diving.  As the player approaches an enemy vessel it appears on the horizon, and if they miss a torpedo they must dive to avoid return fire.  The player must also avoid enemy planes, mines, and depth charges.  The player can return to base at any time to replenish fuel.  The final score is based upon enemy tonnage destroyed.</p>",

After a long battle, the people of Earth were able to drive them back, but the planet and its great cities were destroyed.  Earth's people built one great city with a defense system against the drones.  A network of towers, each with a scanner designed to seek and eradicate drone packs and air mines with minimum risk to human life, were created.  Centuries have passed and only Scanner 13 remains standing, but the drones have come again.  The player has entered the final scanner to try to protect the city from the incoming alien menace using the remnants of ancient technology. </p>\n<p>The player's goal is to scan the entire city for the enemy presence and hidden mines by moving left or right.  The player can x-ray an entire city area at any time.  If the scanner encounters a mine signal they must quickly hunt the air mine, and fire when discovered. If they hesitate the city is vaporized.  If Flutter Drones are encountered, the player must quickly determine if they intend to attack, and then activate defence shields to protect the scanner.  There are 3 levels of difficulty, and the player has minimal energy to finish their mission.</p>",

Confounding this are spiders which rapidly move about and can take Basil's life.  The squares Basil moves across become solid, and neither spiders nor Basil can cross these again.  These can serve as safety barricades or obstacles.  Basil can move off the top and sides of the screen to circle around to the other side, where the spiders can not.  Basil can also horizontally shift the ground beneath him to brings items closer and rearrange squares.  Fruit can be picked up for bonus points.  The player starts with 3 lives, and gains bonus points for time remaining after finishing a stage. Progressively harder levels have more spiders.</p>",

The ship moves laterally left and right at the bottom of the screen, and fires vertically upwards.  The goal is to destroy all enemies each level, and the enemies faced become tougher with each new wave.  The player starts with crawlers, but then must face mad moths, spiders, hover flies, tracker bats, super bugs, and eventually tarantulas, bombardier beetles and then scorpions.  The player starts with three lives.</p>\n<p><em>To Boldly Go</em> is a text adventure where the player takes the role of the four main crew of the <em>USS Enterprise</em>: Admiral James T. Kirk, Captain Spock, Doctor McCoy, and Commander Montgomery Scott.  The player can change between the characters at any time, and each character has specific abilities for different situations.  Admiral Kirk has been tasked with visiting the outpost on Omicron 5 to investigate a small island with an unusual radiation signature.  Starting aboard the Enterprise, the crew must explore the planet's surface.  All commands are via VERB NOUN command, and there is a save/restore feature.</p>",

The player functions as its guardian angel, responsible for protecting it from incoming ships and bombs.  The player can move their ship in all directions.  A crosshair in front of the ship shows the position any potential fire will take.  Incoming bombs fall from the sky, and the player must shoot them down before they reach the city, or the player loses a life. On higher levels additional enemy ships attack the player.  The ship has limited fuel and ammo, and these can be replaced by landing on a refueling platform.  This takes the player to an additional screen where they can move their ship laterally and accelerate, trying to make a smooth landing on the platform to replenish their supplies.  The player starts with five lives, and it's game over if all are lost.</p>",

In the first five screens, the player must move their avatar up and down platforms collecting keys and gold bars.  Blue keys for blue doors and yellow keys for yellow doors.  Five gold bars must be collected from the first five screens to bribe the guard to let the player past.  </p>\n<p>When the clock strikes 12 a ghost appears, who moves towards the player and attacks.  The player can enter attack mode which opens up a sight that the player can aim and shoot the ghost.  Bullets must be obtained from the chest on the first screen, and these can run out.  The player can also run off the screen to escape the ghost.  The player starts with 500 health points, and these can run out from ghost attacks.  </p>\n<p>Starting with screen five,  the player can only jump straight up or fall down shafts.  Seekers at the top and bottom of the screen can kill when they are level with the player in the shaft.  The player must collect power podules, as these are needed to power the laser to defeat Morbid in the final screen.  Morbid appears protected by a force field with a small gap.  The player must hit Morbid through the gap four times to defeat him.</p>",

Boris can move laterally and jump between platforms.  Moving platforms can only be entered from above. On each screen there are three diamonds that Boris must collect one at a time and bring to the rail truck at the top of the screen.  When all three diamonds are collected, Boris moves to the next of four levels.  The Orbis initially doesn't move, but when Boris jumps, it begins to chase him.  The player can move off the edge of the wrap around screens.  Boris starts with three lives.</p>",

Each player takes turns placing one of two colored pieces on the board. The player gains any pieces on the board their opponent has between their two pieces. The player with the most pieces at the end of the game is the victor. There are four levels of computer difficulty. Commands are via entering column and row.</p>\n<p><em>Space Trek</em> is a <em>Star Trek</em> variant where the player is commander of the Federation flagship <em>USS Dragon</em>.  The player must destroy all the Trojans in the galaxy in a given time.  The player has control of the battle computer, navigation, range scanner, and shield energy control.</p>\n<p>The battle computer automatically fires at enemy Trojans when the <em>USS Dragon</em> is correctly positioned against enemy vessels.  Navigation involves warp drive, which allows movement between quadrants on a 10 x 10 grid, and impulse, which allows low speed travel within an individual quadrant.  The range scanner allows detection of the contents of distant quads with a range up to seven.  Shield controls allows movement of energy from reserves to shields.  If shields drop to 0 the ship is destroyed.  Star bases allow the player to recharge energy.  Planets can be mined for dilithium crystals to recharge bases.  Black holes take the player to another quadrant without the use of navigation.</p>\n<p>There are four levels of difficulty, and the player can choose their mission from a randomized galaxy and number of enemy ships and time to complete their mission.</p>",

There are four artifacts in total, and the player must collect all pieces of each artifact to complete them and return to the starting point.  The wizard moves through a maze that scrolls in all directions, filled with monsters that move about.  The player can shoot fireballs, but these drain their limited power, but can obtain wands that allow fireballs to be thrown without penalty.  Touching monsters also drains health.  Keys must be collected to open doors.  It's game over if health falls to zero.</p>",

However, the landing party has been stranded on the surface as the transporter has failed.  </p>\n<p>The key to the dimensional gate has been shattered into pieces and each of the remaining starships has managed to find one.  The nearest starship, <em>Pharos</em>, is now circling Mishma, where their captain has been imprisoned.  The player must help the captain of the <em>Endeavor</em> rescue the <em>Pharos</em> and find the piece of the key.  The party consists of Captain Chrostopher James, Science Office Selvon, Doctor Michael Spears, and Engineer Hamish Mc'Crindle.</p>\n<p>The player can explore the many decks and rooms of the <em>Endeavor</em>, as well as beam down to the surface of Fiskirb to explore and search for the force field generator. All commands are via VERB NOUN commands, and the player can switch between the four members of the landing party at any time. Each member has unique skills, and must be used to solve specific puzzles. There is a save and restore feature.</p>",

The ship is navigated by moving the joystick in the opposite direction of desired movement and applying thrust.  Game play is divided into separate launching and high-orbit sequences. Ship movement is limited by available fuel.  Game difficulty is adjustable by amount of time and fuel to complete the mission.  Once in orbit, satellites can be neutralized by shooting them with the ship's laser.  If the player strikes the ground during the launching process or is shot down by a satellite, it's game over.</p>",

He is now holding the entire solar system ransom with a gravity bomb that, if allowed to go off, will draw matter into itself until it becomes the gravitational center of the solar system. </p>\n<p>The player starts in an arcade sequence, where they must land on one of the four landing pads in the space scene.  If they run out of fuel, it's game over. After landing, the player must explore the underground tunnels.  These are explored by moving up, down, and in the four cardinal directions. The player's progress is hampered by robots and the corrosive elements, and the player has limited oxygen and energy for their travels.  After reaching the center of Phobos, the player must defuse the gravity bomb by deciphering the code word.  The player must then reach their spaceship at their original landing point to escape to safety.</p>",

The players take turns placing a total of 93 letters on the board to spell words which must link with other words already on the board. The opposing player can challenge the word if they don't think it's legitimate. If the player can not spell a word they may take a turn to exchange their letters. There are 2x and 3x letter squares and 2x and 3x word squares. The game finishes when no more words can be spelled with the remaining tiles, and the highest score wins.</p>",

Every move costs a point; the player can also transport randomly on the screen at a cost of 5 moves.  The player starts with 100 moves, and it's game over if they run out.  </p>\n<p>As the player explores they encounter random events like holes which cost 5 moves, magic holes which award 5 moves, black holes which randomly transport the player, and Fairy Nuff who rewards multiple moves. The player can also fall into a dungeon where they explore potential exit points, but might get eaten by a Red Devil.</p>",

Now, after fighting their way through the Zoreen guard-ships, out of fuel and with a damaged computer, the player's survival prospects look even slimmer.  With Guard Robots and Secret Police ringing the outworld capital, even penetrating the Ringwall will be bad enough.  Only agent 6809 would stand a chance, but, with the shipboard Reincarnation Unit on the blink, even survival looks questionable. </p>\n<p>The player must bring back the Golden Orb, a map of Zoren, and a sample of the latest Zoreen Laser Gun to their transporter, as well as fuel to make the return journey.  There are short arcade sequences involving landing the transporter.  There are several instant-death situations, but the player has limited resurrections available.  The locations of items are randomized.</p>\n<p>All commands are via VERB NOUN entry, and there is a save/restore feature.</p>",

Before his death, the mighty Wizard placed his treasure in the 90 great vaults, conjuring up 48 members of dungeon spawn to stand guard throughout eternity.</p>\n<p>The player moves their small character between rooms.  The player starts with 20,000 health, and all moves and waiting causes health to drain.  As the player moves between rooms they are attacked by monsters, who require a specific amount of energy to defeat.  Health can be restored by the potions Merlin left scattered about the maze.  Items can be picked up, and must be brought back to the starting room.  Only a few of the 48 items can be carried at a time.  The player can find sword and shield to assist in combat.  Bombs will instantly destroy an enemy.  Warps allow the player to randomly travel through the dungeon, and tunnels allow one-way travel to a different room.  Victory is achieved by bringing all 32 treasures back to the starting room.</p>",

Once Tyan enjoyed a warm climate and the land was fertile.  Over the last few years the winters have grown longer and the crops have failed.  Strange creatures have been reported straying into Tyan from the north. </p>\n<p>At this time, the trickster god Loki captured the King's daughter Lovilia, and took her back to his Citadel of Ice.  The King, beside himself with grief, commisioned Kishtu, the most powerful wizard in the land, to return his daughter. Kishtu found Lovilia's soul locked in a shard of ice suspended from a golden thread within the Citadel.  Kishtu forged a magical knife to cut the thread, but was destroyed by Loki before it could be used. </p>\n<p>Now, the player has been tasked to finish Kishtu's quest.  They must enter the Citadel of Ice, locate the Knife of Kishtu and his four magic rings, and release Lovilia's soul. </p>\n<p>The player creates 1\u20135 characters with individual strength, wisdom, dexterity, and charm, which effect the actions they can complete.  Characters have limited life points and carrying capacity.   All commands are via VERB NOUN entry.</p>",

In the bowels of the dungeon, guarded by the most powerful and terrifying of dragons, dwells the Evil Lord.  The Tall Whisperers say that he prepares to set forth with many loathsome creatures to seize the fair lands in his dark and terrible power.  </p>\n<p>A party of five bold adventurers consisting of a warrior, amazon, cleric, hobbit, and sorcerer have joined forces to destroy the Evil Lord.  Each level of the dungeon consists of interconnected rooms that might contain a treasure chest, a monster, stairs, or a food item.  Previously explored rooms disappear unless the player discovers the Lamp of Daybright.  In combat with a monster, the player selects a character to fight, and the results are displayed on the screen.  Each character has individual hit points.

Each successful landing gains 10 shots.  Each object blasted scores a point, while hitting a mine loses a life.  On screen 2, the player tries to blast all the enemies that come swooping in from the right of the screen.  Each hit scores five points, while collisions cost a life and add 50 onto the timer. The object of screen 3 is to reach the top without colliding with an enemy.  Getting there gains 250 points, and allows the player to access further stored ammunition.  The player has the remaining time on the timer and up to three lives to reach the goal.  When the player runs out of time, they are shot by a missile which can't be avoided.  After every successful raid, the player restarts the three screens, but enemies move faster and the timers are reduced.</p>",

In the first part, Richard the Lionheart is building his forces for the Third Crusade.  His men are scattered throughout the forest of medieval England, and Prince John's army is tracking Richard down.  Lettered squares on the screen represent Richard's men, while green areas represent thick forests.  King John's men will constantly move towards the player, and will burn down any forest or men they encounter.  The goal is to collect at least 450 men and escape out the bottom right of the screen.  King John's men always start in the bottom right of the screen, and will reappear there after burning down 10 forest squares.  If his men catch Richard, it's game over.</p>\n<p>In the second part, the player explores the Holy Lands from a top-down perspective.  The player has limited food and strength which are depleted with movement.  The player can visit different sites marked on the map, which can increase the player's strength or food, or can offer puzzles which, if solved correctly,will strengthen Richard's party.  The player also engages in combat with roving bands, and the party with the highest strength will win.  Once the player is strong enough, they must attack Saladin's fortress, where they need a high power level to defeat the enemy.  The player can run from most combats, but not the final battle.  It's game over if strength falls to 0.</p>",

The player starts with a mine detector and 10 percussion grenades.  </p>\n<p>Played from a top-down perspective, the player tries to cross the screen from the bottom to top. The mine detector will detect mines ahead, to the left, and right.  Grenades can be used to knock out enemy bases, and these bases have wire-guided missiles to knock out patrolling helicopters.  Extra grenades can be seized by passing through a minefield and surprising patrolling guards.  There's a limited amount of daylight, and during night the player must maneuver using the metal detector and lights from the bases and patrolling guards.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Death Mines of Sirus is a combination arcade and text adventure for the Dragon 32/64.</p>\n<p>The year is 2112, and the planet has been fighting the intergalactic wars for the past 70 years.  Strontium 98, a rocket fuel vital for the war effort, is mined from the moons of Sirus, a star system discovered in the 21st Century.  Originally the Humans had good relations with the Siruns, but it appears the Siruns are now negotiating with the enemies of Earth.  The player has been selected to assist Captain Phoenix as he attempts to confirm or refute these reports.  </p>\n<p>The game is divided into two parts.  First is an arcade component where the player controls a landing ship, and must safely land on the four landing pads on each screen while avoiding asteroids that move horizontally across the screen.  After doing this, the player must return to the waiting command ship located at the top.  The player must achieve a sufficiently high score to obtain the passcode for the text adventure.</p>\n<p>In the first part of the text adventure component, the player's ship has been invaded by a deadly fungus.  The player must seek help to defeat the invading fungus.  All commands are via multiple choice, and the player must proceed through the adventure by choosing the correct gameplay options.</p>\n<p>In the second part, the player has now entered the base on the surface of Sirus.  In this sequence the player moves a small dot representing their character around schematic pictures of the base.  The player can enter a number of different rooms, where they can interact with items and consoles.</p>",

The buggy can shoot vertically upwards, jump, and roll along the ground, speeding up and slowing down.  The player must jump over mines and holes on the ground, while also avoiding or shooting down enemy spaceships that descend from the sky.  The player must refuel by jumping into fueling blocks.  As the player jumps, their vehicle's stability decreases, and too many jumps or hits from alien vseesls will cause the moon vehicle to explode.  The player must pass a total of 40 zones to receive the password for the next section.</p>\n<p>This allows the player to enter the text adventure component.  In this section the player must solve the mystery of the moonbase where Strontium-98 is stabilized.  All commands here are via VERB NOUN entry.  During this section the player must also pilot a spaceship by typing commands, and engage in combat with dangers from the sky.</p>",

The player and Captain Phoenix must show they are up to the task.</p>\n<p>In the first arcade section, the player controls a spaceship that moves laterally, and fires directly forwards.  The player has limited fuel, and must survive enemy ships, space mines, and power barriers.  The player must visit three of the first five planets to receive a password to start the first adventure.  </p>\n<p>In the text adventure component, the player has been tasked by the Central Computer to prove they are worthy to kill the Emperor.  They are dropped in an unknown land, and must find the transporter disc to return.   A map helps guide the player's movement on the planet's surface, and the player must scavenge for weapons to fight off attacking monsters.   All commands are via VERB NOUN entry.  </p>\n<p>By completing the adventure, the player is given a password to access further action sequences, which will ultimately provide the passcode to access the final adventure sequence.</p>",

The player starts each level with 45 bullets, and if a duck does off the edge of the screen on the third row five bullets are lost.  If the player hits a bonus target, then all rabbits are turned to ducks, and the player loses their bonus score.  The goal is to shoot all objects except for the bonuses.  If the player runs out of bullets it's game over.  Between rounds, the player shoots at Tommy Tank, which reverses direction on the screen whenever shot.</p>",

Setting out to make it their own, the player finds themselves running the island, now christened Zotoka. The island is not easy to run.  Food is needed all the time on the developing island.  If people get restless then soldiers are called in to invade the island.  If they set up more than two enemy bases, then the player is deposed.  The island is also ripe for hurricanes, which can ruin all the player's work.  The goal is the rule the island for 5 to 20 years. There are multiple skill levels, and the people must be provided with housing.  There are numerous improvements for the island, including: hospitals, factories, fishing, housing, defensive bases, which are placed on a 10 x 10 grid.  The player must also maintain a standing army to defend against invaders that can destroy the nation.</p>",

Played from a side perspective, Dickie can move in all directions and fire forwards, but is always pulled down by gravity when not using his thruster pack.  The planets are inhabited by numerous aggressive species that will attack Dickie.  </p>\n<p>Every five levels, Dickie upgrades his spaceship, but as a result of steering, he will crash land on the next planet.  On these levels the player must reassemble his spaceship before refueling.  Items can be picked up, and are automatically dropped in place when the player flies above their landing site.  After fully refueling their ship, the player has 30 seconds to reach the ship and safety.  There are six levels of difficulty, and the player can start with 5 or 10 lives.</p>",

During the voyage the crew must remain fed. </p>\n<p>To engage in combat, the player must move their galleon on the same square as their enemy. The ship with the most fighting crew is the winner. Pieces of eight are used to buy crew and gamble at the islands. Food, men, and treasure can be purchased by visiting the different ports. Treasures and gold can be stored at the home port so it can't be plundered or lost. The player with the most treasure at the end of the game is the winner.</p>\n<p><em>Tombstone</em> is a re-release of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/204688/deadwood/\">Deadwood</a>: Welcome to the Western town of Tombstone.

The player can gamble if they land on the casino, and owe money if they land on pot luck, the taxman, general store, or trading post. If any player goes into a negative balance they are charged a 10% bank fee each turn, The time for each game is selected at the beginning, but this can be extended.</p>",

This world was rich with nature and enlightenment, the power for which came from the Great White Crystal.  But, darkness came to the land in the form of the Scard Lord of Night.  He transformed the crystal from white to black, and enslaved the world for 1,000 years.  The player is the last of the Karn, and it is their quest to climb the tower, find the crystal sword, and strike the black crystal to free the land from Scard's power.</p>\n<p>The player controls a wizard that moves laterally, and can climb up and down ladders.  The goal is to climb higher in the tower.  The Scard Lord appears randomly, and fires to the left and right.  They must avoid other dangers including spiders.  The player must pick up food, and if they run out of energy they will die.  The player picks up a sword at the bottom of the tower, but this can only be used on the White Crystal.  If the wizard gets hit, it's game over.</p>",

The player is the Offshore Installation Manager for the rig, and is responsible for coordinating rig activity to maximize oil production.  The player controls a workforce of 200 men, and a weekly budget of $1,000,000. The goal is to drill a total of 100 million dollars of oil from the North Sea.</p>\n<p>Each turn begins with allocating the weekly budget to drilling consumables, maintenance spares, food, and charter berths.  This gear is loaded into a supply vessel, and player must travel from Aberdeen, Scotland to the Dragon Delta located 260 nautical miles away.  The player must control for wind and tides in their navigation.  The more attempts it takes to reach the destination, the more supplies that are swept overboard on arrival.</p>\n<p>Once supplies are safely aboard the Dragon Delta, workforce must be apportioned to drilling, maintenance and services.  The Dragon Delta is then positioned on the North Sea to initiate drilling.  A number appears above each location drilled, and the closer to the center of oil that turn, the higher the oil return.  The player has several drilling attempts to locate this.  At the end of each turn a balance sheet demonstrates current oil production.</p>",

Their fighter escort is close at hand.  They outnumber the British 4:1.  The player must control their Spitfire to shoot down incoming German aircraft.</p>\n<p>Played from a first-person perspective, the player's Spitfire can deliver 16 short bursts of machine gun fire.  The player can swerve left or right to avoid Messerschmitt 109 sweeping frontal and rear attacks.  When the Heinkel opens fire, the player needs to dive to avoid being hit.  If the player is hit twice, or sometimes even hit once, their plane is destroyed.  Enemy aircraft can take 1 or 2 hits to destroy. The goal is to destroy nine enemy aircraft in a single flight to reach the rank of Ace.</p>",

To prevent Time Ship building, they are destroying British industry.  The player has been recruited as a time pilot in the local barracks at Bilston.  Bilston is usually swarming with military Time Police, especially in times of rebellion and war.  The player can travel through time from 1945 to 1076, otherwise there is evidence they will materialize into a lake or a wall.   The player must find the Time Police computer, which exists for one year during this time.</p>\n<p>Played from their time machine, the player has numerous menu options to travel through time and search for wayward machines.  The player can also exit their machine to do battle with Time Police, firing their blaster.  From their time machine, the player can use their limited fuel to travel to different time zones.  The player will encounter trivia questions as they appear in different time zones by turning on Mind Probe mode. Fuel can be refilled by discovering the 40 missing time machines. For limited gold, the player can also detect booby-trapped ships, remove a booby trap, locate target century, or use their arm blaster.  </p>\n<p>The time traveler is also in danger of encountering a deadly serpent.  While they have a limited number of antidotes, the snake can also be avoided by re-entering the time machine.</p>",

The craft can move left and right, and must avoid red, white, and blue debris.  The player can color shift between red and white, allowing passage through similar colored debris.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Chessboard Tracker</em>: The goal is to trap the computer controlled runner using 2 - 4 player controlled trackers.  The runner tries to reach the bottom of the board, while the tracker tries to surround them or force them against a wall.  All pieces move diagonally, but the runner can move forwards or backwards.  Home squares randomly transport runners and trackers to another corner, while blockouts either allow no movement or only the runner to pass. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Masterbrain</em>: A Mastermind game, where the player must solve a 6 or 7 color code in a total of 7 guesses.  Each turn they're told if their guesses are the correct color, correct location, or both.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Mushroom Muncher</em>: The player tries to destroy all the blue mushrooms on the screen.  The player can move in all directions, but only fires vertically forwards.  The player must avoid the mushroom guardian, and pick up power pellets to move faster and replenish ammunition.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Nad the Necromancer</em>: Sol the Sorcerer's spell book has been stolen by Nad the Necromancer.  The player travels on a numbered grid to chase Nad.  Squares can contain snakes and trolls. The player casts energy fields to block a single exit.  When the player encounters Nad, he will flee to an adjacent room, but not a room containing an energy field, dead end, snake, or troll.  The goal is to trap Nad so that he can't escape.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Pepper's Breakout</em>: The player controls a horizontally moving paddle at the bottom of the screen as they attempt to bounce a ball to destroy the blocks above.  There are 7 levels of difficulty.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

The vessel is controlled by rotating and applying thrust.  The ship is armed with phasers that are used to destroy enemy ships.  Taking damage from Klingon vessels and firing phasers depletes energy. The player manages shield control and photon torpedoes.

Status reports allows evaluation of ship damage. When ship sections become damaged they are inoperable until sufficient time has passed to enact repairs. </p>\n<p>Sectors can contain starbases which allow the player to replenish energy, stars which are unnavigable, black holes which instantly move the ship to another sector, and planets which can be landed on for mining.  Radio pulsars make sectors unscannable from a distance, while sectors with a nova constantly deplete shields.

The base is defended by two pairs of guns and alien spaceships that appear and vanish randomly. The player controls a flying saucer which automatically flies back and forth over the alien base. </p>\n<p>The player is armed with phasers that can destroy yellow alien space ships, lasers that destroy green alien space ships and force fields, and bombs that disable enemy guns, enemy blocks, or destroy the base.  </p>\n<p>The ship starts with 100 percent energy, which is decreased by movement, firing weapons, or hit by alien fire. When energy reaches zero, the player's ship must land to refuel while the enemy regenerates.  There are a total five difficulty levels.  Final score is based upon how many shots are required to defeat the enemy.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Lazerbyx / Thermo Nuclear War</em> are two action games for the Dragon 32/64 packaged together. </p>\n<p><em>Laserbyx</em> is a 2-player light cycle game.  Each player controls a thin line representing a light cycle, which leaves a permanent trail streaking behind them as they move through a maze.  The goal is to force the opponent to hit a wall, an obstacle, or the trail of another cycle.  Each cycle starts at a home base represented on the screen.  There are a total of 15 rounds per game, and each round is worth progressively 1 more point to the surviving cycle.</p>\n<p><em>Thermo Nuclear War</em> is a 1-player game versus the computer, where the player must stop the computer from taking over the world.</p>",
