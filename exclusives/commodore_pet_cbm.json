In this whimsical take on the artillery duel, two human players assume control of two rustic shacks, one on each side of the screen.  Across the top wanders a lonely cloud, innocuous but full of hostile potential.  Apparently the denizens of the houses are mad scientists with fully-functional weather-controlling apparatus, since each turn one player gets to select a variety of weather -- Hail, Rain, Tornado or Lightning -- to inflict upon his or her opponent.  Selecting a \"charge\" to assign the attack, based on the cloud's shifting location and a variable wind speed, the aggressor hopes to land a damaging strike upon their neighbour.  The game is won when one side has successfully harnessed the forces of nature to completely dismantle the other's residence.</p>",

However the player must be careful of mines that are not visible but can be detected when they are nearby. The player has shields which can withstand only a limited number of explosions. The goal is to earn as much money before the player dies.</p>\n<p>There are also walls which can block the player. Walls can be destroyed by using the disruptor weapon. The weapon has limited ammo which is increased by collecting crystals or completing a level by moving to the exit marked by the letter A. The disruptor also disables nearby mines.</p>",

The player can also fall a certain distance from time to time. Getting caught in a blizzard, like moving itself costs energy. When all energy is depleted the game is over.

In this version you don't have to find solid ground, but you must make sure to not crash into the surface. In the game the lander starts at 52,800 feet above the surface and the player must make sure to land at a reasonable falling speed, to make sure the lander doesn't crash. The player can perform thrust in nine different quantities using the numeric keypad to reduce falling speed. There is only limited fuel, meaning the player can't simply go down in a leisurely pace.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Star Force</em> is very similar to the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Star+Fire\">Star Fire</a>. The player must shoot TIE Fighters from a first-person perspective. Using the numeric keys the player can rotate the view into any directions. Each time the player hits a TIE Fighter it will explode and the player will receive points. If the player holds the targeting reticule on a TIE Fighter for a while it will lock-on, any hit after that will automatically hit. The TIEs also shoot back. Although the player cannot die from hits, it does reset the score multiplier. The game is over when the player is out of fuel.</p>\n<p>The player must be conservative with lasers as each shot will build up heat, if the player fires too many lasers in a row the firing mechanism will overheat, leaving the player vulnerable for a while. The player can also control the speed of his spacecraft to either slow or fast. In the HUD a small radar view is visible which shows where TIE Fighters are about.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Blockade Special!</em> is an action game that bears similarities with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Snake\">Snake</a>. In the game the player has to escape from a maximum security prison.</p>\n<p>The game uses a top-down view and the player can move in eight directions. The avatar uses a trail that automatically keeps moving. If the player maneuvers the avatar to a space it has already been the player dies. Unlike in <em>Snake</em> where the length of the trail is finite, here the trail keeps in place until the next level. The player can opt for a hard mode to make the trail invisible. In this case the player must remember exactly where he or she has threaded.</p>\n<p>Like in <em>Snake</em> the player can collect items to score points, in addition the player earns points for each step the avatar makes. After sixty seconds robots will set electric fences on random positions of the game field, these have to be avoided. If the player lasts out for a while longer, he or she advances to the next level.</p>\n<p>The player can switch between nine different difficulties. Higher difficulties result in a higher movement speed, meaning the player runs out of space to walk on quicker.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the player is rewarded with a bonus stage where quick reflexes can earn additional points.</p>",

The player must fire on ever-moving asteroids who break up into smaller pieces when shot. When in trouble the player can use hyperspace to escape to another random location on the screen.</p>\n<p>In this version the ship instantly brakes when the player lets go of the thruster and everything (including bullets) can only strictly move in eight directions.</p>",

The ball can only travel at eight different angles, so it doesn't move very realistically when colliding with round objects. Bumpers score points as well as the spade, diamond, club and heart in the middle of the field. Collecting all four of those grants an extra ball on top of the five balls the player starts with.</p>\n<p>There are no paddles until the player hits a button, so good timing is required.</p>",

The goal is to slay a dragon with a spear. Each turn the player may throw his spear in one of ten caves. If the dragon is in the chosen cave he dies, if he's in an adjacent cave he'll snort. The dragon can also change cave. Between each throw the player must retrieve the spear. If the dragon in the mean time moved into the cave, the player dies. The player also dies if he or she fails to kill the dragon before the clock strikes eight.</p>",

Players can determine for themselves both the amount of eligible numbers and the length of the code. There is no limit to the amount of guesses the player makes. It is also possible to give shorter guesses. For example, if the code consists of six letters, guess a code of only three to see if you have the first three right. Or even guess for longer codes to see if certain numbers are in the code.</p>\n<p>After each guess the player is shown the \"blacks\" and \"whites\", respectively correct numbers in the right position and correct numbers in the wrong position. When the player has guessed the correct code, he or she is shown the total number of guesses it took and is asked to continue a new game with the set rules or redefine the rules.</p>",

In the game the player must position a see-saw in order to keep an acrobat in the air. The player scores points by popping balloons that are placed near the ceiling of the circus. In addition the player scores points for each jump and can score various bonus points. If the acrobat touches the floor the game is over and he's carried off in an ambulance.</p>",

When an exit is found the game notifies the player how many seconds it took him or her and then generates a new maze.</p>\n<p>When moving around, the game actually scrolls the maze, instead of moving the player's character. The game loops horizontally and vertically, so that the entire maze can be seen at any given moment, but when near the edges it will be broken up for added difficulty.</p>",

The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen and must prevent a ball from hitting the floor and at the same time destroy bricks at the top of the screen by hitting them with said ball. Each destroyed brick scores points.</p>\n<p>There are some subtle differences compared to the original game. The paddle is controlled slightly differently. Pressing either the left or right direction with Keypad 4 or 6 respectively moves the paddle in that direction, and the paddle keeps moving until it hits the side or the player presses 5. The game can also be played with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/3373/creative-software-inc/\">Creative Software's</a> joysticks.</p>\n<p>When the ball hits a corner of a brick it will not bounce back and instead break through multiple rows, this makes it easier to get the ball above the rows of bricks. Because the game is written in BASIC the ball can only travel at a 45 degree angle, causing it to leave quickly as well. </p>\n<p>The player starts with 10 lives with which to score points. There's no keeping of high-scores.</p>",

At this point the computer presents an equation and the player must predict the incorrect outcome the computer will give.</p>\n<p>The player starts with 100 points and with each equation or try points are subtracted from the total.

Each sample costs a start-up sum and one additional dollar per tree in the sample. The idea is to estimate the diseased percentage as closely as possible. Every percentage away from the actual amount will cost the player additional money. Once an estimation is made, the game will also show the player what the computer would have guessed using its methods and what the costs would have been.

The game world consists of a 10x10 grid and both players start in an opposite corner. Each turn a player can let all ships move one tile in any direction and fire on an enemy ship. The different ship classes have different hull strengths and ranges within which they can fire. The destroyers also carry two torpedoes which can be fired in addition to the normal attack. Ships also have limited ammunition meaning the player shouldn't waste anything on shots that are bound to miss.</p>",

The player and the computer take turns by entering a coordinate. The game then announces if the shot was a hit or a miss. The goal is to sink all enemy ships. Ships take up three tiles in this game and to sink a tile all three tiles must be hit. Ships can be placed by the player and the player may do so at any location on the board, both horizontally and vertically as long as ships don't overlap or partially fall off the grid.</p>\n<p>A later release of the game featured different length ships and different views for either player.</p>",

Targets come from four different directions and the player must shoot them by pressing the respective direction on the key pad. The player has only limited energy and shields. Each shot costs energy and each missed target loses a shield point. When either runs out the game is over. The game keeps track of the best score the player received. Points are gained for each target shot. The player cannot move the avatar at the center of the screen.</p>\n<p>The player can choose from nine different difficulty levels which determine the number of shields and energy available to the player.</p>",

The game will refer to the player as Popeye and simulate the most absurd environments including monsters eating the enemy ships and the player being demoted to deck scrubber. There don't seem to be any tactics that'll prevent the player from failing horribly. Like the original game, the player controls a submarine and will be asked to perform a command each turn, which are selected by the numeric keypad. Commands include maneuvering, shooting, diving, etc.</p>",

Enemies also roam the maze and will kill you when they come in contact. They do not know where the player is unless they have line of sight. The player is given the general coordinate of the treasure, but must still look around in that vicinity. When the player finds the treasure more points can be scored by solving an anagram puzzle. Finally the player must find the exit, which is again at a random location of which only a general coordinate is known. When the player escapes the game is over and his or her score is shown.</p>",

All the player has to do is say how much money he or she will bet, the slots will then turn and if the player is lucky a prize winning combination will pop up. When there's a price the player receives a number of times his or her bet in return.</p>\n<p>The player can bet anything between 1 and 5000 per round and keep going forever. The game keeps track of how much money the player is ahead or behind. Unlike real slot machines this one is calibrated to break even.</p>",

It is up to the player to scoop them all back up and drop them in their four specific containers again. The player can collect as much chemicals on the scoop as he or she wants, but when different chemicals come in contact with each other they will react and disappear. The four chemicals are represented by hearts, spades, clubs and diamonds and must be dropped off at the four corners of the screen. To make it more difficult the player's scoop cannot keep still. It'll continuously keep moving, so the player has to dodge chemicals that are not identical to the current chemical on the scoop.</p>\n<p>The player scores points for chemicals brought to the correct container. The amount of points rises exponentially depending on the amount of chemicals that are dropped off at each drop. The goal is to earn as many points as possible.

In the game up to four players are presented by a grid of eight by eight tiles. As usual in their turn players can pick two tiles which are then unveiled. If a pair of selected tiles is identical, they are removed from the grid and count as points for that player. If the cards don't match they are hidden again. The game ends when all pairs are found. The player with most pairs found wins the game.</p>",

In the first, the police agent must find the perpetrator. After that, in the second, the agent must try to capture him.</p>\n<p>The game is presented as a top-down road map of the city. The police agent can move along the streets at will. From time to time the perpetrator will commit crimes which will be indicated such as \"Freeway accident\" or \"Bank robbery\". The location will remain unknown, but using the map the player can try to devise whereabout the perpetrator is. Once the perpetrator is spotted by the agent he will become and remain visible. It's up to the player to capture the perpetrator by strategically placing roadblocks, which only come in a limited supply. The game is over when the perpetrator is caught.</p>",

Both players have a button for true and false and earn points depending on how quickly they gave the right answer. They can lose points when they give the wrong answer. The maximum number of points that can be received from a correct answer is thirteen, the minimum is one. After about ten seconds the game automatically switches to the next question and players who didn't answer yet receive no points at all. Questions range from addition, subtraction, multiplication and division examples. Players can easily change the frequency of each type of question changing a data array in the BASIC code.</p>\n<p>The game ends when a predefined number of points is reached.</p>",

The attackers will tear down walls to make it easier for future waves, but the player has the option to rebuild walls as long as they are not completely destroyed.

All game modes are for two players and require the players to bounce a ball back and forth. There are four different difficulty settings that determine the size of the paddles and the speed of the ball. The first player that earns fifteen points wins any of the games, or when the space-bar is pressed the game ends when the next point is made.</p>\n<p>Tennis functions as the original <em>Pong</em> game, while Squash has players standing on the same side of the field bouncing a ball towards each other via a wall. In Hockey both players have two paddles, an offensive and defensive one. The ball must also be played towards a goal instead of a general side of the screen.</p>",

The player controls a tank at the bottom of the screen which can move left, right and fire. The Cosmiads fly at the top of the screen and have to be shot down. Once in a while one of the Cosmiads will dive down shooting at the player. The player earns points for shooting the Cosmiads and triple as much while they are diving. Once all Cosmiads are dead a huge Zylon will appear and move down the screen <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a> style. The Zylon opens and closes its mouth continuously and if the player manages to fire inside it, it dies.</p>\n<p>One twist in this game is the inclusion of fuel. Shooting costs fuel, so if the player misses too often the fuel will run out and the game is over. When the Zylon is dead the tank is refueled and a new wave of Cosmiads appears. The goal is to score as many points as possible.</p>",

The ship can fire a laser with a single and double blast in alternation.</p>\n<p>The game has infinite levels with each five stages. Each stage is different from the others. In three of the stages the player must shoot enemies, each with different movement and attack patterns and points earned for destroying them. In the other two stages the player must simply avoid indestructible scenery. Each level has the same stages, but the difficulty goes up slightly.</p>\n<p>When playing with two players, the players take turns which last until the ship is hit and explodes.

Each 10 second interval the player must give the command of how much thrust to use. Depending on the chosen difficulty level the player has a certain amount of fuel. Fuel also contributes to the weight of the lander causing thrust to have more effect later in the journey. The goal of the game is to land with a safe speed (less than 10 meters a second).</p>",

The player can give a coordinate and the computer will highlight the coordinate on the grid in the right area coding. The game is over when the player has found the intersection point of the two lines. The fewer guesses the player made the better.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Hartenjagen</em> is a card game (hearts) that can be played by a single player against three AI players. Unlike the version included with most Windows releases this version features a slightly different rule set, but the core mechanics remain the same.</p>\n<p>Each player is dealt thirteen cards and must play a card each round in clockwise order. The first player determines the suit and the other must match suit if they can. The person who plays the highest card of the same suit wins the four cards played. The initial goal is to earn as little points as possible. There are multiple cards that score points if they are won:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each card of hearts is worth one point</li>\n<li>The jack of clubs is worth two points</li>\n<li>The queen of spades is worth five points</li>\n<li>The ten of diamonds is worth ten points</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a player manages to win all 30 points in a game, all other players get 30 points instead.</p>\n<p>Once one of the players has reached 75 or more points, the rules are reversed. It is now the goal of the game to earn points and each point detracts points from your total. The first player to reach 0 wins the game. The number must be met exactly, e.g. a player with 2 points which scores 12 points is set back to 10.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Labyrinth</em> is an exploration game in which the player is placed in an ever changing labyrinth. The game plays in turns and each turn the player can move in one of eight directions. Additionally each turn all monsters on the current floor may move and more walls will spawn. So the longer the player stays on a certain floor, the harder it becomes to navigate that floor. The goal for the player is to defeat a number of monsters and collect an amount of gold. When the required number is acquired the player must still move to the exit at a given floor.</p>\n<p>Aside from gold, walls and monsters there are also jump pads which will launch the player to a different part of the current level, ladders which can be used as launch pads or to travel a level up or down and doors which can uncover monsters, gold or ladders behind them.</p>\n<p>If players find themselves stuck, they can press the panic button. Panicking allows them to either jump to a new location (at random) in the current level or to move to another level. Making use of this will increase the requirement to finish the game (number of monsters killed and gold found).</p>\n<p>Defeating monsters is done through games of reflex and chance, such as guessing the right letter of the alphabet within a fixed time-frame or playing a form of Russian roulette.</p>",

Once all bases are destroyed the player goes game over. The game is divided in levels, which determine the amount of meteorites that come hurling towards the ground and the number of points received for shooting them down. Meteorites that hit the ground, but not a base don't make the player go game over, but can no longer be shot down for points. After each level, one of the bases that is destroyed (if any) is rebuilt.

        "description": "<p><em>Microstring</em> is an action game about timing and perception, that has little to do with a certain type of women's underwear. The player controls a symbol in the middle of the screen. At the top and bottom a scrolling string with beads is displayed. The goal of the game is to touch all beads on both strings as quickly as possible. The catch is that the player can only move up and down and that the symbol re-centers as soon as it hits the string or when the player lets go of the cursor keys. Thus the player must try to time his or her actions correctly so that the symbol arrives at the string just as the desired bead scrolls past. Beads must be touched alternatively from the top and bottom string. Once all beads are touched the game is over and the player is informed about how long it took.</p>",

Any 2 requires the opponent to draw 2 cards and skip a turn, a joker requires the opponent to draw five cards, an 8 requires the opponent to skip a turn. A Jack can be played at any time and afterwards the player may decide which suit should be played afterwards.</p>\n<p>In this computer game adaptation the player takes on a single AI opponent and two decks of cards are used.</p>",

The player can target a position on the screen where the missiles should explode, but must guess the trajectory of the bombs and estimate the travelling time of their missiles to make a hit. Once one of the bombs hits the cannon or a city it's game over.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Vanishing Maze</em> is a randomly generated maze game with a twist. The game is played from a top down view and the goal for the player is to escape a maze. The player can choose from three different maze sizes, the largest of which fills an entire screen. The twist in this game is the fact that the player gets to view the maze while it's being randomly generated, but then the whole maze disappears and the player must navigate on a blank screen. The player must try to remember the path he needed to go. If the player manages to reach the end without hitting a wall the player earns the full 1000 points. The player loses points if walls are hit. Halls that are hit are also drawn again on the screen.</p>",

Whoever is closer to 21 points wins. Having 21 points exactly is an automatic win.</p>",

Monsters charge the player when they get near and the player uses a sword and bow to fight them off. Monsters become visible once they are four spaces away from the player and can move three spaces each turn. During the player's turn the player can move, shoot, slash or change weapon, more tactical options allow the player to brace themselves for combat advantage or waiting for monsters to move into position. The goal is to retrieve jewels and a holy sword from a haunted tomb of a long-dead wizard.</p>",
