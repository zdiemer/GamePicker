        "description": "<p><em>Golden Abyss</em> is the fourth game in the <em>Uncharted</em> series and the first one for a handheld device. The story is set before the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/31220/uncharted-drakes-fortune/\">Uncharted</a>, when Nathan Drake did not yet get acquainted with Elena, but works together with his old pal Victor Sullivan from previous <em>Uncharted</em> games.</p>\n<p>The story follows Drake to the ancient temples somewhere in Central America in search for gold. His partner in this endeavor is Jason Dante, a crook, perhaps, but Nathan has no reason to doubt him even though they aren't closest of friends. Nathan is an expert in this kind of stuff, and Dante needs him to find the lost treasure. After some climbing and trespassing, the two of them meet up with Dante's partner Marisa Chase. She is in it for more than just gold... her grandfather went missing while searching for this treasure and she is hoping to find him still alive, or at least find out what's happened to him. But this is a dangerous jungle swarming with the local guerrilla led by Roberto Guerro. This general is also eager to find out the treasure as he believes it will fund his army and help him in his fight. As such, he sees our heroes only as a means to an end, and if they're not useful in search for the gold, he won't hesitate to execute them.</p>\n<p>While the overall gameplay is similar to the previous titles, <em>Golden Abyss</em> introduces some PS Vita-specific features. While climbing or descending, you can tap the nearby ledge or draw a path to see Nathan do all the jumping on his own. A similar mechanic is used during hand-to-hand combat and quick-time events where you need to swipe the screen in the designated direction to perform a certain move. Aside from the touch screen, the PlayStation Vita's camera can also be used to photograph and identify various locales. The image of locales in each area can be found in Nathan's diary.</p>\n<p>Each area contains various treasures, some which cannot be found unless you cut down dense jungle in front of it. Nathan keeps track of all the collected treasure in his diary, as well as the list of all still missing ones. Certain tablets or markings won't be pickable, but you'll be able to make their impression of the paper by using screen swiping technique. While some gems and stones are simply collectibles, there are certain items that provide an insight into what happened to Marisa's grandfather or the path he took.</p>",

This is the first time the Chimera, dreadful abhorrent-looking beings coming from another world, are invading America; which places the events in a time in-between <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/25088/resistance-fall-of-man/\">Resistance: Fall of Man</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/39157/resistance-2/\">Resistance 2</a>. Enemies can be destroyed by gunshots (from a range of assorted weaponry totaling to eight weapons) and melee attacks; there are also different bullets, some are able to break through walls for instance.</p>\n<p>In addition to dual sticks and shoulder buttons, it is possible to make use of the front touch screen (to melee, interact with the environment, lock Tom's aim on one of the foes, utilize weapons at the fullest of their possibilities in a secondary firing mode) and the rear touch pad (Tom will run if that's dabbed twice), thus employing PS Vita's distinct control system possibilities.</p>\n<p><em>Resistance: Burning Skies</em> is divided into two unlinked game modes: the single-player adventure and the online multiplayer game, the latter \nof which is unrelated to the plot of the game, relying on three game modes (deathmatch, deathmatch team, survival) which can take place in six maps.

It is a game for all audiences, where serious violence have been replaced by funny attacks and outlandish fighters. Instead of using 3D scenes for combat arenas, the game uses the augmented reality technology as environment. Aside from the face detection technology fighters can be fully customized through over 400 pieces of clothing, 15 fighting styles and over 50 weapons. Combinations of those three make available combos or moves that damage or modify armor or specific body parts. The game has dual control options, using the regular buttons or both front and rear touch.</p>\n<p>The gameplay takes the classic fighting game mechanics one-on-one, against AI or against other players around the world in the Online Versus mode. In the Story mode, players fight against Mr. Miyagi disciples across the world to become a true reality fighter. Players can share their fighters with other players across network and show friends using social networks. Other game modes include Survivor, Time Attack and Quick Fight.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The introduction video about progress in racing vehicles in history ends displaying the unforethought abilities of new antigravity floating cars, or rather ships, which move not touching the ground, thus freely from friction and able to perform and reach otherwise-impossible moves and speeds. It is the year 2048. Antigravity racing run by pilots driving racers that hover over the ground is at its outset, in New York City. <em>WipeOut 2048</em> is a futuristic racing game, part of the launch software for the PS Vita, whose temporal setting places it in the beginning of the <em>WipeOut</em> chronology.</p>\n<p>Success is achieved by both eliminating the rival drivers and preceding them to the goal, the gameplay essentially consisting in both ultra-speed racing (displayed at 30 frames per second, although the PS3 instalment of the series previous to this had graphics running at 60fps) and using weapons against the other racers. Tracks are wider, having been planned to simplify a gaming behaviour focusing on attacking the opponents.\nAs racers float, the lack of friction with the ground makes the physical behaviour of these different with that of ground-touching racing vehicles, particularly increasing sensitivity to steering, which lays stress on gameplay's trickiness.</p>\n<p>The single-player campaign consists of a succession of events of four varieties: Race, Time trial, Combat and Zone event. For each of them, there are 2 requirements (a standard and an elite pass one) which, if fulfilled, disclose one or more than one new events. Each event belongs to a speed class, that expresses its degree of difficulty; each Zone event, however, can be played in all speed classes (a new harder one everytime the earlier is cleared).\nEvents are visualized in a honeycomb-like grid: success in one mission opens the way to one or several new ones; besides, the choice to go past an event is given to they who fail it for a certain number of times. Race events principally revolve around driving fast: requirements are usually to rank in the first three or first. Courses for race events are designed to ease sheer speed. In combat events, succeeding requires a bellicose playing style and a determined damage to be done to the rivals, which is measured by points. Courses for combat events are designed to encourage a bellicose, offensive playing style. Time trials events requirements exact the goal to be reached in a time under the given one. In Zone events, the vehicle is accelerated permanently: the task is to reach the end of the course safely, being allowed to nothing but to steer; these events are played in 8-bit-styled versions of the racetracks. Direct and indirect weapons, as well as other power-up items \u2014 an auto-pilot aid that, for a few seconds, deals with braking in place of the player, and a turbo boost\u2014, are distributed along tracks together with speed boost pads. Newly for the series, the glowing pick-up icons representing all mentioned items are now of 2 colours, green (those that give a power-up) and yellow (those giving a weapon).</p>\n<p>Racetracks are 10 in total, some of which ported from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/38330/wipeout-hd/\">WipeOut HD</a>. Racing vehicles a total of 20. Some of them are prototypes, experimental racers obtained by success in prototype events. 30 trophies, bracketed into bronze silver gold and platinum ones, are obtained by achieving assorted objectives and reward the player in different ways. Ships are assorted in 4 categories: Speed ships are the expedient choice for time trial racing and fastest driving generically. Agility ships suit the Zone mode. Fighters have the strongest bodies together with the most powerful weapons, being the choice for combat events and combat play generically. Finally, Prototype ships are peculiar, experimental vehicles obtained through success in prototype events: these see the player driving a prototype racer: if requirements are met, that will be able to be used in any event.</p>\n<p>As it is habitual for the series, musical tracks are licensed pieces of electronic, techno dance, dubstep music composed or performed by groups such as The Chemical Brothers, The Prodigy, Kraftwerk, many of whom have all provided sound tracks to other games of the series. The main sound effect is that of engines; at higher speeds, it comes to the foreground. Game controls are designed to on the one hand make it possible to play in the traditional manner and on the other one implement PS Vita characteristic capabilities: front and rear touch controls, motion controls, vocal commands controls are used to respectively accelerate, activate weapons and shields, fire weapons, motion sensors allow tilt controls, meaning that steering is possible by rotating the device on an axis perpendicular to the plan of the screen and passing on the centre of it. The front camera is used to take a shot of the player and show it to all opponents they have just beaten.</p>\n<p>Multiplayer gaming is available both via local ad-hoc local and online play, up to 8 players. Online multiplayer, which exacts an online pass, is parted into a multiplayer campaign, whose design faithfully iterates that of the single-player one, and Cross-Platform Play, enabling challenges involving players on the PS Vita and on the PS3 on four courses from the PS3 game <em>WipeOut HD</em>. Online play is a straight succession of events over which players are left no power of decision except opting for one of two options after a race: it does not give the players choice over which track to race on, event type, speed class. If less than 8 players participate in the race, there are no cpu-controlled ships to make the amount of contenders be 8.\nAnother Cross-Play feature is that who already owns PS3 <em>WipeOut HD</em> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=WipEout+HD:+Fury\">WipEout HD: Fury</a> will be gifted with free download of the games on their availability as DLC for the PS Vita.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Shinobido 2: Revenge of Zen</em> is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/30436/shinobido-way-of-the-ninja/\">Shinobido: Way of the Ninja</a> and just like the original game it is an action stealth game similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/414/tenchu-series/\">Tenchu series</a>.</p>\n<p>The game sees titular hero Zen caught amidst an ongoing struggle for power in the Utakata-Province in ancient Japan six months after the events of the previous game. There are three concurring factions, lead by the Daimyos Ichijo, Lady Kihan and Kazama. Zen himself is on a personal quest for revenge, searching for Shu the Cypress, who not only killed his girlfriend but also threatens to open the gates of hell by assembling all of the Tenma Mirrors. Zen tries to find them before Shu and therefore also has to put up with the ongoing conflict. At some point, he gets help by Kaede, literally the living mirror picture of his girlfriend. From then on she is a playable character as well except for the main story missions.</p>\n<p>The game consists largely of semi-random missions the player can carry out for either of the warlords to change the balance of power in the Utakata-Province. There are a bunch of different types of missions: escort ox-carts, attack ox-carts, theft missions of varying types, abduction missions as well as rescue missions, bodyguard missions, elimination etc. Successfully carrying out missions can lead to weakening one warlord (e.g his food-supply or military strength) and help another (e.g. by increasing food supplies or military intelligence). It also can lead to a change in your standing with the involved warlords. If the military strength of one warlord is very low, the player will have the option to either do a mission to protect the warlord from attacks or to kill him. As long as there is more than one warlord left, there will be a steady stream of new missions, which theoretically can prolong the came indefinitely. Real progress in the game is made by completing story missions which usually unlock as you do missions for the warlords. Gameplay-wise there is no real difference to the warlord-missions other than the inclusion of boss-fights.</p>\n<p>All missions take place on a set number of relatively large, open maps that include palaces and cities as well as mountainous regions and villages.\nLike its predecessor this is mainly a stealth game, Zen is pretty weak in combat, but can get around the levels fast and silent with high and far jumps and, later on in the game, also a glide ability. There is also a crafting system in place that lets you produce different kinds of items: potions to increase health etc., trap items like poisoned sushi, bombs and mines. A different way of acquiring items is by just buying them or picking them up within the levels (e.g. as loot drops from fallen guards). Another RPG-aspect is added to the game by the way of a stat-leveling system that lets you increase your health, strength etc when leveling up, since completed missions not only net you money but also XP.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Chronovolt</em> is a 3D puzzle-platformer marble game in which the player has to guide his Chrono Sphere through the twists, turns and traps and hazards of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/329366/m-c-escher/\">Escher</a>-like arenas. You must perfect your control of speed and dexterity to guide the Chrono Sphere to the exit on each of the many levels. The player is able to control time in various fashions, stopping it for selected objects, rewinding it and creating time warps. This increases the complexity of the puzzles. Time is controlled through the front and back touch panels.</p>\n<p>During the 19th Century, a great experimental scientist Dr Horatio Chase discovered Chronovolts, a rare form of electricity generated from anti-matter. He found that machines powered by this energy could split the space-time continuum and make time jumps. Dr Harvey and his laboratory assistant Scabious Claw spent years building a Chrono Sphere, a free-rolling bathysphere that could travel over any surface and draw in Chronovolts to maintain power. Claw saw the power as a way to quick riches, stole the blueprints and disappeared back in time in the Chrono Sphere. Dr Harvey by this point too frail to take chase was left with just a small early prototype to pursue Claw in. Without the time to adapt the device, he called upon his young grand-daughter Jessica to hunt down Scabious, recover the blueprints and destroy his missing Chrono Sphere for fear of it falling into the wrong hands. Jessica Chase is an 18 year old bright and feisty girl who spent many years watching and learning from her Grandfather in his laboratory. It is she who will pilot the Chrono Sphere through time and guide the ball through each level. Claws aim is to travel from the past through into the future harnessing as much of the world\u2019s Anti-matter as possible to become the master of Time and controlling his autonomous agents secure all sources of Chronovolts for his exclusive use.</p>\n<p>Apart from the classic marble game mechanics (tilt the device to give the ball a direction) the player is also allowed to play with time. By collecting chronovolts he is able to power the time controls. Each of them will have a different cost in term of chronovolts.* Rewind time: this is the classic time modifier that allows the player to rewind the game if he fell from a ledge or did something wrong.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Stop time: the player will be able to touch the objects he wants to stop. For example to try and traverse a bridge made of rotating platforms he will be able to stop them for a certain amount of time each and synchronize them so that they align.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Time warp: time warp is more of a weapon that the player can use against Scabious\u2019 chronospheres sending them to a different time dimension.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The player, controlling Jessica, follows Claw in his time travelling. Claw travels through time in search of mysterious powers linked to the supposed end of the world in 2012. First he travels to an ancient Mayan period, looking for the Tortuguero site. One inscription of the site, now defaced, is supposed to talk about b\u2019ak\u2019tun 13, the period in the Mayan calendar that corresponds to the end of 2012. Then the adventure moves on to China, 1000 BC. Here the nasty Claw is searching for the Book of Changes. Again to find out more about the end of the world predicted by the Chinese. The final chapter of Chronovolt takes place in the future, on Nibiru, the planet that is supposed to hit planet Earth.</p>",

Most levels require the Katamari to be as large as possible within the time given, but some levels have specific goals such as making the Katamari as 'rich' as possible by rolling up expensive things or there is a maximum number of items to roll up.</p>\n<p>New to this Vita-specific title is the option to stretch or squeeze the Katamari by using the rear TouchPad so that the Katamari can roll through very narrow spaces that can't be reached with a ball-shaped Katamari. After each succesfully completed level, the player is rewarded for the size and content of the Katamari, both by the King and the person who requested the Katamari.

        "description": "<p><em>Lumines: Electronic Symphony</em> continues the stylish music puzzle game series. This title retains the same base gameplay of the previous games: there are 2x2 square stacked blocks vertically descending that are either of one color or another. The player's goal is to match the four segmented blocks to make up a square stack of the same color, however it is possible to match more than four blocks. Stacked blocks do not disappear until a timeline moving horizontally from the left side of the screen sweeps over them, so it is possible to match more blocks of the same color until then. The larger amount matched will increase the amount of points received.</p>\n<p>The 2x2 square blocks can be controlled via the traditional method with the d-pad or by using the touch screen, and the player can rotate the blocks as they descend. Once a block hits a stack on the playing field it will break into two columns if the stack is uneven, otherwise it will it simply stop as it hits a stack or the bottom of the field. If the blocks stack up to the point where new blocks will not fit in the field the game will end. Also returning is the changing skins as you play, which will completely change the graphics, sound effects, and music as you progress. These skins also change the speed of the timeline moving over the field. </p>\n<p>Another major gameplay feature of <em>Lumines</em> are the special block segments. There is a chain block that will allow any segments of the same color connected to disappear with the next sweep of the timeline. A new block introduced in <em>Electronic Symphony</em> is the shuffle block, which randomly rearranges the layout of the stack it touches. Another new feature is the avatar power, which is activated by simply tapping the avatar on the bottom left of the screen. There are various avatars that can be chosen for both single-player and multi-player modes and they each do something different. </p>\n<p><em>Electronic Symphony</em> has several different modes to play in. The main mode is called Voyage where the player keeps going until they reach the end or a game over. The others include Playlist, Stopwatch, Master, along with the multiplayer only Duel mode. Experience points are gained from all game modes which will allow the player to unlock new skins and avatars.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Chizuru Yukimura is currently beginning her first year of high school at Haku\u014d Academy. She enrolls at the suggestion of her childhood friend and neighbor, Heisuke T\u014dd\u014d, a second year at the school who has attended since it was an all-boys' school. However, despite opening its doors to co-education, Chizuru remains the only female in attendance at Haku\u014d Academy. A spin-off of the <em>Hakuoki series</em>, <em>Sweet School Life</em> replaces the typical historical setting of previous entries with a modern high school setting. With a greater focus on romance, dramatic battles and historical events are replaced in favor of a calm, \"slice of life\" environment. Endings can be obtained for all previous love interests in the series, albeit with modern twists to accommodate their ages: homeroom teacher and disciplinarian adviser Toshiz\u014d Hijikata, health and physical education teacher Sanosuke Harada, third year student Chikage Kazama, and second year students S\u014dji Okita, Hajime Sait\u014d, and Heisuke T\u014dd\u014d. Additional, non-romantic endings may also be unlocked for side characters.</p>\n<p>Aside from the branching routes typical of a visual novel, <em>Haku\u014dki SSL: Sweet School Life</em> features mini-games as an integral part of gameplay. Appearing occasionally throughout the story, Chizuru may perform various tasks such as answering questions in a classroom or taking on the role of a waitress which leads into a simple mini-game. Obtaining high scores on these games gives the player points, allowing them to purchase items such as pictures and short stories at the shop. Another prominent feature, introduced to accentuate the modern setting, is Chizuru's cellphone. The player is given complete access to it during the story, and is able to reply to mail sent by other characters in an attempt to increase their affection.</p>",

Set in the Horn of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and South Asia, the game features an arcade-like scoring system that encourages bite-sized play sessions across 45 unique missions. Players are scored on how well they perform during each scenario: from the various ways they can take out opponents to their mission completion time to their ability to maintain stealth.</p>\n<p><em>Unit 13</em> also allows players to select one of six different operatives that best fits their play style: from the shotgun-wielding pointman, Zeus, to the expert U.S. Marine Scout Sniper, Alabama. Completing solo missions with each character earns experience, gains access to additional guns and explosives, and unlocks weapon upgrades and skills. Other features include personalized leaderboards, an in-game event feed, special \"High Value Target\" missions, ever-changing \"Daily Challenges,\" and two-person co-op over WiFi.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Murasaki Baby</em> is a 2D side-scrolling puzzle platformer played as a baby's girl nightmarish journey through her imagination. Visually it draws inspiration of the 80's movies of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tim+Burton\">Tim Burton</a>. The girl wakes up at night and enters a door that takes her into a fantasy world. The main goal of the game is to reunite the baby with her mommy. She is constantly scared and in order to progress the player has to help her avoid danger.</p>\n<p>The baby cannot be controlled directly. Instead, using touch, you lead her by pulling her forward by her arm, by holding your finger on the screen. The amount of pull can be adjusted and if you do it too fast she trips and falls. She also carries a purple, heart-shaped balloon she clings to. If it is lost or pops, the game restarts at the latest checkpoint. You can swipe it back to her when she loses it, but you also need to get rid of bugs shaped as safety pins (by tapping them) and thorns to avoid popping. In some sections an umbrella can be used to protect her against objects and enemies. All control is based on touch. When she is scared of the dark for instance, you pick up light sources and move them to dark areas so she can pass.</p>\n<p>During her journey she discovers different types of balloons usually carried by characters she meets. When they are popped, the back touch panel of the Vita can be swiped to move to an alternate dimension and use new abilities. Switching scenery can make a jack-in-the-box pop, enables wind, makes the baby shrink (allowing her to float), turns the screen upside-down, flips gravity, summons a creature, and can turn the balloon into stone. Some objects are also only visible in a specific scenery. Different abilities often need to be used in succession to solve the environment based puzzles. There are four worlds in total.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Uta Kumi 575</em> (aka Song Builder 575) is part of Sega's Project 575 which utilizes vocaloid voice synthesizers and allows users to control the input of the song lyrics. The story follows two high-school students, Azuki Masaoka and Matcha Kobayashi, who got bored of daily school life and decided to perform songs in haiku-like style and share them across the net. The game consists of story elements which progress through unlockable months that feature anime-style dialogues like a visual novel with full voice-acting where the player can only proceed through the dialogue. That in turn unlocks new songs for the month which can then be played in order to unlock newer and longer songs.</p>\n<p>Songs come in three sizes: short, medium and long. Short and medium sizes are unlocked as you play new songs, while long ones need to be bought with the points you gather by performing various songs. The song's size also affects the difficulty level. Unlike a typical vocaloid games such as those from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Hatsune+Miku\">Hatsune Miku</a> series where you have to press the right button as the notes appear, this game jumbles lyrics making you input the words before they can be sung. Game lyrics are sometimes broken apart so you have to insert them in a correct order to maximize the efficiency of gathering points, but even if you switch the words in an illogical order, they will still be played and you'll be able to get points on properly mashing buttons through those (i.e. words might be entered as \"sam-ple\" or \"ple-sam\", with all words in the game being in kana). Sometimes there is only single word selected which requires you to select it quickly before it disappears. Other times, multiple words are offered where only one can be entered, so you decide the lyrics. Often, part of the selectable words are entered (only one kana character) which helps you decide which word to use more quickly. Building lyrics and hitting the right touch screen (front or rear) for the upcoming song notes happens simultaneously.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ciel nosurge</em> is the first game in the Surge Concerto series, which shares a universe and themes with the Ar tonelico games while sharing little in terms of plot and setting. The game is divided into 12 main episodes, an epilogue, and 3 additional episodes that focus on side characters. Gameplay itself is split between the simulation segments in which the player interacts with Ion and develops their friendship, and visual novel segments that explore Ion's memories.</p>\n<p>Ion is an amnesiac girl who lives in a sealed world, where her only companion is a shopkeeper named Nelico. One day, a strange terminal appears in her room, and though she cannot receive any sound or visuals through it, it does give her a mental connection to the person on the other side. The player is that person, and their Playstation Vita is the tool they use to communicate with Ion. Though she lives on her own schedule and may not always be available to talk to, the more the game is played, the more Ion will try to synchronize her schedule with the player's. The player is able to talk to Ion, ask her to synthesize new items such as clothes, go on dates with her, and dive into her dream world to try recovering her lost memories.</p>\n<p>Ion's dream world is heavily damaged, and the player must fix it by using the PS Vita's camera to read bar codes from the real world. Scanned bar codes will create fairy-like creatures called Sharls, which will then work to repair the damaged memories once the player has spent Hymmno Points to make a pact with them. The most efficient way to earn Hymmno Points is through online play, and other online options also exist that allow players to communicate with one another and interact with each others' Sharls.</p>\n<p>Once a memory is restored, the player can watch it play out in the form of an uninteractable visual novel. As the memories unfold throughout the game's 12 episodes, Ion and the player will learn more about the planet of Ra Ciela and the important role she had in its history.</p>\n<p><em>Ciel nosurge RE:Incarnation</em>, released a little under a year after the original release, came with the first four episodes and all patches up to that point already on the cartridge, and was also packaged with a voucher to download the fifth episode for free. A set of DLC costumes was also created exclusively for this release, and some user interface changes were made as well. A few months after that, the original version of the game was given a discounted rerelease under the Playstation Vita the Best range.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Silent Hill: Book of Memories</em> is a <em>Silent Hill</em> spin-off game exclusively for the Sony PlayStation Vita. It is the last <em>Silent Hill</em> game produced by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/229308/tomm-hulett/\">Tomm Hulett</a> before his departure from Konami. He joined WayForward Technologies, the game's developer, as a director afterwards.</p>\n<p>At the start of the game the player may customize the protagonist (which can be male or female) to his liking. This makes <em>Book of Memories</em> the first <em>Silent Hill</em> game without a set protagonist. The story revolves around a mysterious book the player receives on his birthday by an anonymous sender. All of the protagonist's memories are written there, and by altering the book, he finds that he can alter past events in his life. Before the changes take effect though, the character falls asleep and must survive a nightmare, explore the Otherworld and battle creatures from previous <em>Silent Hill</em> games on the way.</p>\n<p>The primary focus of the gameplay is on dungeon-crawling and cooperative multiplayer action, rather than the survival horror elements that the series is known for. There is a large focus on combat in <em>Book of Memories</em>, including the ability to harness special powers called Karma Abilities which can assist the player in combat.</p>\n<p>Monsters are separated into three categories: Blood, Light and Steel. Killing enemies of either the Blood or Light category will affect the Karma meter in different ways. This meter controls what powers are unlocked and usable at a given time. If the player is more inclined towards Blood (killing Light creatures), this will unlock destructive abilities, while Light (killing Blood creatures) unlocks powers focused on healing and protection. Steel creatures are neutral - killing them won't change the Karma. There are also Power Moves, which can be purchased in the shop of Howard Blackwood (of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/55316/silent-hill-downpour/\">Silent Hill: Downpour</a>). Like other games of the genre, the protagonist's abilities can be improved by leveling up and raising his stats in different categories, allowing for different character builds and combat specialization.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The year is 102014. The Earth's surface lay in ruins, no longer able to sustain human life. As such, humans have retreated underground and created civilization within cities known as Panopticons. Hope remains within the human race that they will one day be able to return to the surface, but for now, a new system to accommodate underground living has been established: Panopticons offer safety in exchange for service. Unfortunately, inequality between population and resources proves problematic; even newborns are considered criminals due to their consumption of valuable resources. The player assumes the role of a customizable male or female citizen faced with a sentence of 1,000,000 years for the crime of living. The player character must attempt to diminish their sentence by performing as a volunteer in war, primarily against monsters referred to as \"Abductors\" which are generally known to capture ordinary civilians. The player character is supposedly resigned to this unpleasant life until a chance meeting with Beatrice, a woman who comes from a mysterious city in the sky.</p>\n<p><em>Freedom Wars</em> is a third-person action game with an emphasis on combat. The player can switch between guns and swords in battle, and also has the ability to use their \"thorn\", a grappling whip which allows them faster travel and extra combat options. In battle, the player always has the assistance of their Accessory, an android who, like the player character, is fully-customizable. Players can order their Accessories to fight alongside them or rescue civilians from the battlefield. Missions usually consist of fighting against Abductors, but also vary between item retrieval and capture the flag-type objectives. Successfully clearing missions reduces the player's sentence, giving them more freedom and privileges such as more customization options and weapons. Online modes also exist, with competitive and cooperative modes for up to eight players. For competitive modes, players select a Panopticon to represent based on real-life cities and war with players in other regions.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>DRAMAtical Murder re:code</em> is a remake of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/159798/dramatical-murder/\">PC visual novel</a> that further popularized boys' love. The player character is Aoba Seragaki, a young adult who lives in the Old Residential District of the fictional island of Midorijima and spends his days working at a junk shop. Aoba's peaceful life is interrupted when he is unwillingly dragged into the world of Rhyme, a popular yet dangerous street game made up of virtual battles. Throughout the story, Aoba uncovers the mystery of the exclusive nearby resort, Platinum Jail, while navigating treacherous streets and pursuing a relationship with one of the men who ally themselves with him. Some changes have been made to appeal to a wider audience; scenes containing large amounts of nudity and blood are either replaced altogether or redrawn with censorship. The game's primary new feature is an original route for Mizuki, friend to Aoba and owner of a local tattoo studio, that explains plot holes and unanswered questions from the original game, with both a bad and a good end. Other features include trophies, new music, and at least 20 new scenes drawn by the original game's artist.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>IA/VT Colorful</em> is a rhythm game in a style similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/10484/hatsune-miku-games/\">Hatsune Miku series</a>, in which a fictional singer created through Vocaloid software takes a starring role. The game features 60 songs created by various producers that make use of the Vocaloid IA; all songs are unaltered from their original state, with many even retaining their original music videos. Gameplay consists of notes that flow along tracks, which may form lines as well as unique shapes and patterns. Notes are hit by tapping the corresponding button when they reach the end of the track, indicated by a light that shines on the note in a circle. Timing on notes is scored depending on accuracy in relation to the song's beat, with \"safe\" being least accurate and \"cool\" being most accurate. Missing the note altogether ends the chain; a chain that spans the song's length earns the distinction of a crown on the song select screen. Songs are scored depending on the aforementioned ratings, represented by a \"Colorful\" percentage, with a triple-S rating being the highest. </p>\n<p>Generally, songs are split by video type: \"real-time\" videos are original to the game and usually feature a 3D model of IA, \"game original\" videos are also original to the game but do not make use of IA's model, and \"original\" videos were taken from the source. Only real-time videos include a customization option in the form of IA's costume, with 21 costumes to choose from in total and 3 colors for each costume. The game's main mode is \"Free Play\", where all songs can be played across three difficulties: Easy, Normal, and Hard. As more songs are unlocked, they become progressively more difficult regardless of difficulty. Other game modes include \"Step Up Play\", a challenge mode where specific goals must be met in each song, \"Daily Play\", which allows the player to play a random locked song once a day, and \"My List\", which gives the player the opportunity to create a setlist \u00e0 la <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Guitar+Hero\">Guitar Hero</a> and play the chosen songs in succession.</p>",

As in previous entries in the series, the player's Sackboy or Sackgirl is fully-customizable using materials and accessories unlocked throughout levels in the main game. The creation mode also makes a return, allowing players to create their own levels and share them with others. The Vita's touchscreens are also usable in this iteration; the multi-touch function can be used for competitive mutliplayer games, while the rear touchscreen can be used to push objects toward the player, creating the illusion of an extra dimension.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Tearaway</em> in an action game set in a world where is everything is made out of paper. It is about a messenger, either the male character Iota or the female character Atoi, controlled by the player, who needs to deliver a message to the sun. The character is the message that needs to be delivered (the head is an envelope). At the same time, the player is also an actual character in the game, referred to as \"the You\". It is represented by the sun showing the player's face in the centre using the Vita camera, similar to the way it is shown in the <em>Teletubbies</em> TV show. The sun appears in many parts of the game and always shows a direct, real-time video capture of the front camera.</p>\n<p>The core gameplay is similar to a traditional third-person action platformer where the character needs to explore, complete environment based puzzles and defeat enemies known as Scraps who shadow the sky and attempt to obstruct the delivery of the message. The game uses a large amount of other interaction in different ways. Using the rear touch pad, the player can interfere with the game world as it matches the movement of the fingers as they are shown pushing through the bottom of the game world, for instance to defeat enemies. This technique, also available on the front touch pad, can be used to make tears into the world, create hills, move objects, launch the messenger using drumskin-covered platforms, unroll paper bridges, or to poke through paper walls. Objects have a specific pattern that show the player whether the touchpad requires drumming or tickling, or pulling or peeling, to interact. By blowing into the microphone strong gusts of wind can be created that influence the game world. The character can also pick up objects and throw them. Certain enemies need to be dodged and can only be picked up and be thrown when they are stunned after dodging an attack. Other enemies are defeated by jumping on their bellies. Each area has different types of items to collect. Many abilities are unlocked gradually, such as the Weaponized Squeezebox to suck in things and blow them out, riding a pig, shaking the entire world using the gyroscope function or rolling into a ball form.</p>\n<p>Along the way confetti can be collected. It is used to unlock decorations to customize the messenger. There are many characters to meet that provide quests for rewards. In some of them new items need to be designed. This is done in a separate screen showing a pencil and a peace of paper. Using the front touch pad the player draws a design (with multiple layers possible) and then uses scissors to cut it out, for instance to create a crown. There are pieces of paper in different colours available. This mechanic is used to customize many items and characters in the game world. There is also a camera to take pictures of characters in the game or selfies of the messenger or the player, with different types of filters and lenses available, unlockable through confetti. Along the way papercraft plans can be collected. They are accessed through a profile on the tearaway.me website where photographs are also stored. The papercraft plans, with different skins, can be printed out to create items from the <em>Tearaway</em> world in real life. The rear camera sometimes uses the real world environment as a layer for the bottom of the game world and it also possible to take pictures of real life items and use them as skins for objects in the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Uta no Prince-sama: Music 3</em> is the third in a series of spin-offs in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Uta+no+Prince-sama\">Uta no Prince-sama franchise</a>. As the title suggests, it focuses on the music throughout the series in a rhythm game format. The story is centered around Haruka Nanase as she attends Saotome Gakuen, a prestigious school for aspiring young musicians. Haruka happens to have a natural gift for composing, gaining the attention of a group of fellow students looking to become idols and, ideally, sing the songs that she writes. Haruka devises a solution in which she can compose music for the whole group, and they form a successful idol unit called STARISH. However, as a means to have STARISH reach their full potential, the head of Saotome Gakuen recruits a veteran idol unit to train them, called QUARTET NIGHT. Together, the songs of the two idol units comprise the game's music. </p>\n<p>Gameplay consists of a track that imitates sheet music (as per the protagonist's occupation), with a marker that moves along the screen horizontally. Notes must be hit by pressing the face buttons or d-pad with correct timing as the marker passes by. Once the marker reaches the end of the track, it moves down to the one under it and continues from the left to the right of the screen, repeating the pattern. Notes are graded depending on their accuracy in timing the button presses to the rhythm of the music, with cool being most accurate, good being enough to maintain a combo, and poor being a miss. Music Points, the game's currency, are rewarded depending on how well the song is performed, graded by letter ranks, with bonuses rewarded on the basis of a full combo. Music Points are also rewarded depending on the song's difficulty, which ranges from three levels of easy to three levels of hard to one level of pro (with difficulty indicated by stars). Obtaining an A rank on each difficulty of a song unlocks an \"episode\" in which the idols involved in the song interact with each other (or, in the case of a solo song, interact with the heroine). Additionally, costumes and accessories for the idols can be purchased by using the Music Points obtained from performances, along with customization options for the interface of the main gameplay mode.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Squares</em> is a puzzle game that tests your reflexes and perception. As the name implies, the entire game focuses on squares... tapping them, double-tapping them, sliding them, and turning them into certain color. The game features dozens of levels as well as the level editor for creating one's own level, all of which center around the same goal which is turning all the blue squares into gray ones. Each level has to be solved quickly, and the game is over if either time bar depletes or you accidentally tap the red square which is a big no-no. There are different types of squares, some of which need to be swiped or done something else to before they turn gray, while others may simple requiring a tap or double-tap. Not all squares are present on the screen at the beginning of the level, some become visible as you clear those before, but all are on the single screen. While there is no scrolling-screen levels, many levels consist of multiple screens, but each has its own separate time limit, time is not shared between different areas of the same level.</p>",

But directing your sun light directly onto the flower will scorch it. Instead, you need to aim at the passing clouds which in turn will make them pour rain on the ground. Several such drops will yield a new flower. Flowers vary based on how quickly you water them, if you accidentally scorch them, based on the season and time of day, as well as the setting such as garden flowers or tropical islands. The game uses fixed screen where you control the sun on top of the screen which can be moved horizontally only. You fire sun rays downwards until you either hit the passing cloud or the ground. The game features couple of hundred different flowers, which can be collected and sent to your friends. The entire game plays sideways so you have to hold the PlayStation Vita in a way it was not designed to be played.</p>",

It is a top-down sci-fi game where you control a drone by launching it and trying to collect all the awards to earn more score and pass the level. The drone itself, once launched, cannot alter its trajectory, and if left to drift too far into the space, a black hole will appear to engulf it. Instead, you can use various trajectory beams and gravitational spheres to steer the drone in the right direction and keep it within the level. The drone itself will bounce around from solid objects which can also be used to steer it toward the wanted path or hidden objects to collect.</p>\n<p><em>Extreme</em> version for PlayStation Vita features same levels as the original PlayStation 3 game version, with 10 new levels designed specifically for PlayStation Vita. The game features two difficulty levels, and scoreboards can be shared between PS3 and PS Vita. While the new controls are suited for gameplay on PlayStation Vita, the original PS3 version controls have support for PlayStation Move.</p>",

The protagonist is a young boy who undertook the task of Hanasaka-jiisan to help cherry (sakura) trees blossom throughout various lands. Each land or a level has a time limit where you need to make certain percentage of area blossom by simply jumping around and touching sakura petals. Certain trees have glowing areas which when touched make entire tree or at least a big portion of it immediately blossom. Certain animals like birds or monkeys may try to pluck the petals in trees you have only partially made blossom which will decrease the accomplished percentage of your task. However, once fully blossomed trees cannot lose their petals and animals cannot hinder you by climbing on such trees.</p>",

Not too long ago, as a redevelopment project for the district, the experimental educational system has been introduced where the students would teach and govern themselves in the new Sakumodai Academy. There, the student who are capable would work hard and study, hopefully showing progress and results that the new educational system is working. To award top student, various benefits are being awarded to them. Ren Saijou (\u624d\u57ce \u84ee), who has been away for some time, has returned to the district and transferred to Skumodai Academy, reuniting with his younger sister, Karin, and many of his childhood friends. On his first day in new school, he found himself lending a hand to a girl in trouble. In return for helping her, she invites him to join her club and help her change the school. With a surprised stance, he agrees, seeing this as something to bring excitement in his life.</p>\n<p>While the fanservice is present, <em>Alia's Carnival!: Sacrament</em> is a non-adult port of a PC (Windows) game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/203732/alias-carnival/\">Alia's Carnival!</a>.

Additionally, it supports online ranking. Earning enough scores lets you proceed to the next level, while missing to detonate a couple of fireworks will result in game over and force you to retry the level. As with other AR games, the game supports AR cards which can be placed and scanned with your PlayStation Vita's camera to make an actual location the backdrop for your fireworks.</p>",

You need to use AR cards to set the distance and create stadium after which you tune the surrounding by zooming in on each card so the camera perspective works when the game starts. There are several national teams available for selection, and the entire game is played using touch screen where you can move players and kick the ball. The players themselves are not animated and have a stand attached to their legs which makes them look like an actual figurines.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Hanayamata: Yosakoi Live!</em> is a school-themed comedy visual novel adventure game with a rhythm based elements. The game is based on the original <em>Hanayamata</em> manga series which first came out in 2011. The story unfolds during the course of 10 days, and follows five different protagonists who are members of Yosakoi school club. The school festival is approaching, and with all the mishaps and problems occurring in school they are practicing their dance performance until the day of the festival. While the most of the game is a visual novel style which follows the story and allows certain choices which branch the taken path, the rhythm based element occurs during the practice time, using about a dozen different songs. The dancing element requires pressing the right button at the right time to earn the maximum score. Flowchart of the story is available for each and every of the character which displays which paths you did or could have taken. At the end of each day, the score is given for both the story and rhythm modes, while the rhythm is rated on your success at timing actions, the story is rated based on taken paths, telling you how much of the actual story you have uncovered or strayed from based on your actions.</p>\n<p>The game features five female protagonists, and story can be played with each and every one of them through every of the ten days, featuring full voice-acting for all the included heroines and side characters. There are no text-only descriptive segments in the game, even characters' thoughts are voice-acted. While the story is the same throughout all ten days of gameplay, perspectives are different as different protagonists are in different places doing different things and talking to different people. Even though most of the choices fit experiencing the same story from different point of view, choices can be selected which kind-of alter the story slightly depending with which character you played it (i.e. when playing as Naru you go look for your team members alone, but when playing as Yaya you can select to go look for your team members together with Naru).</p>\n<p>Most of the game is animated to the most visual novels animate, which means blinking eyes, lots of different poses, and lip-syncing. Occasionally, a detailed animation of a character's expression across half of the screen is rendered to emphasize certain scene or event, otherwise, the posture and voice tone depict the right reaction or disposition of a character at the right moment during the dialogue. Message log shows identical icons for characters without their poses, and serves to re-listen certain lines or quick jump back to that point in the game.</p>\n<p>The five protagonists of the story include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Naru Sekiya (\u95a2\u8c37 \u306a\u308b) -- an ordinary girl with a timid personality, slowly growing mentally after meeting Hana</li>\n<li>Hana N. Fountainstand -- transfer student from the US, bright personality with a knack for stirring trouble</li>\n<li>Yaya Sasame (\u7b39\u76ee \u30e4\u30e4) -- a close friend of Naru, beautiful and intelligent, but not showing her feeling lightly</li>\n<li>Tami Nishimikado (\u897f\u5fa1\u9580 \u591a\u7f8e) -- Naru's childhood friend, student council vice-president, gentle personality</li>\n<li>Machi Tokiwa (\u5e38\u76e4 \u771f\u667a) -- close friend of Tami, student council president, serious and strict</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The game also features a bonus menu which includes various unlockables:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rhythm Games - all unlockable songs during the story mode can be played onn three different difficulty levels</li>\n<li>Photo Album - contains unlocked CG art from the story mode where protagonists comment on it as if reminiscing</li>\n<li>BGM Player - in-game tracks heard in the story mode get unlocked here for free play</li>\n<li>Movie Player - lets you replay all the unlocked movies, including the intro opening movie</li>\n<li>Bonus Scenarios - several of the bonus character-themed short stories can be played here when unlocked</li>\n</ul>",

Each with a different background, coming from a different sort of family with only common thing being that they are extremely rich. Now, while he is focused on performing his duties to the best of his abilities to successfully graduate with honors, his focus just may end up getting swayed to one way or another as he meets these five girls... Amelia, Yura, Saya, Maki, and Veronica.</p>\n<p>All the visual novel elements are there featuring full voice-acting. On-screen text can be toggled off with ability to use analogue sticks to zoom and scroll the clear background image with characters.

        "description": "<p><em>Metrico</em> is a puzzle platformer set in abstract worlds based on infographics. The player guides a character using a side view through an environment that reacts to actions, movement and input. Most of the times the character does not need to touch anything in the environment for it to react. Shapes start to move, numbers appear, platforms appear or disappear and so on. To get through the puzzle sequences the player always needs to experiment with the effects of input and then find a way to move platforms or overcome obstacles. Initially all reactions are based on movement and jumping, but later on several Vita-specific types of input are used, such as the touchpad, camera and motion functionality.</p>\n<p>There are about 60 puzzle sequences divided over six worlds each with a different theme. The game never provides hints, but often there are clues in the environment, such as numbers adding up to show how shapes can move or percentages changing based on movement. In later levels sequences sometimes have multiple types of checkpoints that can be used to respawn at a further position than when initially starting the sequence. In some levels projectiles can be shot to reveal or hide platforms, or alter parts of the environment. The back camera is for instance used to capture certain colours in the real world to solve puzzles in the game. At the end of each world there is a choice between two doors to progress and the choices by players worldwide are compared.</p>",

There are three modes - Timed Mode asks you how many points you can make in three minutes, Zen Mode asks you to hang out and make your own challenges (try clearing all eighty tiles in one action), and Endless Mode.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In a series of space colonies at the edge of the galaxy a mysterious disease drives people to uncontrollable rage. Only the healing power of song by the idol group Walk\u00fcre can calm them, with the mercenary soldier force Delta Flight of Chaos defending them during concerts. At the same time the Aerial Knights of Windermere Kingdom exploit the disease to establish their rule over the colonies and their control over ancient Protoculture. Across many skies the two forces will clash to determine the fate of the cluster.</p>\n<p><em>Macross Delta Scramble</em> is an action game set during the first season of the <em>Macross Delta</em> anime. In storyline missions the player takes control of two pairs of pilots: Fan Vernalotte and Hans Schwalm of Chaos, and Victor Harmstadt and Domenic Udetto of the Windermere Kingdom. Both pairs are original characters created for this game who fight alongside the original anime characters of their respective sides, and their names and callsigns can be changed by the player. The player switches back and forth between the factions while playing to see the full story. Outside of the storyline are Extra missions which function as both training missions as well as fanservice events where the heroes of past <em>Macross</em> shows cameo and can be fought.</p>\n<p>Completing missions rewards currency and unlocks new pilots, mecha, and support characters in the shop. Purchased units can only be used by their respective force in Windemere and Chaos storyline missions, but all units, including cameo units, can be used interchangeably in Extra missions. Before missions the player selects a pilot and mecha, a co-pilot and their mecha, and up to five support characters. Mecha accumulate TP while being used in stages, which can then be spent to tune up its stats, such as higher top speed or more weapon ammunition. Each mecha has additional paint jobs, and may have selectable option parts like boosters or armor plating. Pilots gain XP from completing stages, and leveling up increases their base stats and passive skills. The lead support character determines the effect of the Support Skill, such as unlimited ammunition or healing, as well as which song plays for the skill. The remaining four support characters provide passive stat boosts, and if the characters are related, such as selecting all five members of Walk\u00fcre or a pilot and their co-pilot, there will be an additional set bonus.</p>\n<p>During a stage the three forms of a Variable Fighter can be swapped between at will: Fighter mode has the highest speed, but limited maneuverability and no ability to defend or auto-target incoming missiles. Gerwalk mode offers the highest maneuverability and ranged offensive options, while Battroid mode trades off flight mode for access to melee attacks, defending, and the most effective anti-missile defense. Weapons have unlimited ammunition, but finite magazines, and will be unavailable while reloading. Successfully hitting opponents builds the SP gauge which can be spent on either the special ability of the equipped Support Skill, or a very powerful Special Attack which is unique to each pilot. Cutscenes and radio chatter play during missions, both of which are voiced by the original cast members.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Nisekoi Yomeiri!?</em> is a romantic visual novel based on <em>Nisekoi</em> manga and animated TV series. The game features an original story in the series that takes off right after the animated TV series ended. The protagonists controls Raku, son of a Yakuza family leader, who refuses to follow in his father's steps due to his kind personality and prefers to find a decent job. In his adventures he will meet many heroines from the franchise with whom he can get romantically entangled. Gameplay is that of a typical visual novel with characters and on-screen dialogue box over background image. Making choices leads to branching in the story which can lead to one of several different endings.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The game is mainly a visual novel, requiring little player involvement as the story is told and its progress is mostly told through its text. The player will use many different roles varying from Daichi Manatsu, Hana Mutou, Teppei Arashi, Akari Yomatsuri, Amara, Moco and the rest of the Planetary Gears, and can communicate with the other roles in a typical slice of life environment across various paths, aside from the darker and more battle-oriented style of the main game. </p>\n<p>The game contains several outcomes for each player, leading to probable several very odd partnerships including Daichi and Moco being together. Such ends also have gay romantic interactions such as Moco with Ai, or Baku with Amara.</p>\n<p>Certain game modes include \"Touch Mode\", where players may communicate with characters by \"touching\" them with the controller of the screen, and a minigame named \"Mind Puzzle\", where the player is forced to play through the different characters to complete. The mind puzzle will use and combine items from different characters to further progress through the puzzle.</p>",

It features a cast of more than 55 playable characters, each with their own unique ability. As players win rounds, they gain points that can be used to power up characters' abilities. Players also have the choice to play with abilities turned off, at which point the game becomes a more traditional mahjong simulation.</p>\n<p>This edition, <em>Plus</em>, folds in a few enhancements that had been previously released as updates for the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/160555/saki-zengoku-hen/\">original game</a>.</p>",
