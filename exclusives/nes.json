        "description": "<p><em>Dragon Warrior III</em> is the concluding game of the first Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior trilogy, and its story takes us back to the time period of the legendary Erdrick (also known as Loto), the ancestor of the first game's hero. You are the son of a powerful warrior Ortega, skillful in physical combat and spellcasting. Your father went out to fight the evil Baramos, who is responsible for the appearance of monsters in your region, and never returned. You are sent by the king on a quest to continue your father's brave deeds and to defeat Baramos.</p>\n<p><em>Dragon Warrior III</em> is a top-down role-playing game where you travel around the overworld, caves, castles, cities and other locations while battling random encounters, buying equipment, and talking to people. You and your party members receive experience when they beat up monsters and level up with enough experience, increasing their stats. The game features a day/night cycle - as you travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa; shops are typically closed at night. </p>\n<p>You begin with control of just the main character but can quickly recruit three more members to your party. During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard.</p>\n<p>The game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters' classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all of the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight effectively.</p>",

The Tiny Toons are kid versions of the famous Warner Bros. cartoon characters.</p>\n<p>After (once again) losing an animation festival at Acme Looniversity to Buster Bunny, Montana Max has taken his revenge by kidnapping Babs Bunny and locking her up in his mansion. Now, a single player controlling Buster or any one of his three friends Plucky Duck, Dizzy Devil, and Furball must embark on a rescue mission to save her. There are six side-scrolling platform levels, comprised of three stages each (except for Wackyland which has only one stage). Before each level begins, Shirley the Loon will ask the player which of Buster's three partners should join them on that level. Once the player makes a selection, it cannot be changed. Each of the four available characters have different abilities, so it's important to choose the right partner.</p>\n<p>Buster begins the game with three lives, but more can be collected by visiting Hamton J. Pig and cashing out 30 carrots each. The game is over when all remaining lives are gone or when Montana Max has been defeated.</p>",

Using the robot you need to locate your quota of crystals while avoiding the many dangers present in the mines, including lava, rock slides, and unfriendly creatures. The robot is equipped with explosives to help reach remote locations in the mine, or destroy any creatures getting in the way (be careful with explosives, you could set off a rock slide and crush the robot!) Once your crystal quota is met, quickly locate the exit and move on to the next, more challenging mine. Crystal Mines is part action and part strategy. There is a time limit to locate the crystals in each mine, plus avoiding falling rocks and monsters will keep you on your toes, but before long you will need to figure out how to locate crystals by properly removing obstructions and navigating tricky mazes.</p>",

Three years has passed since the Outer Heaven incident. FOX-HOUND has gained intelligence that an unknown terrorist group has seized a remote facility containing mass-produced Metal Gear tanks, as well as a new Metal Gear prototype which was under development. The newly-promoted Lt. Solid Snake is called back into action to infiltrate the terrorists' base with the help of two FOX-HOUND rookies, former marine Nick Myer and navy intelligence agent John Turner.</p>\n<p>The player once again assume the role of Snake. The objective is similar to the previous game, as the player must avoid any kind of visual contact (even moreso than the first game), while collecting weapons and equipment on-site. There is a greater variety of areas such as a jungle, a warehouse, a train, a couple of prisons and even a cargo ship containing the mass-produced Metal Gears. The player must also overcome new traps such as searchlights, soldiers in gyrocopters, door-sealing devices and even suicide bombers. The player must also interrogate captured enemy officers by injecting them with a truth serum to increase their rank, in addition to saving hostages like in the first game. Side-scrolling areas are also included in addition to the main overhead game, where the game takes a more action-oriented route (while still maintaining the stealth premise).</p>",

        "description": "<p>In a movie released in the 1980s, a group of youngsters formed a special gang and called themselves The Goonies. Nintendo banked upon the movie\u2019s popularity by releasing several games using the characters and music from it, including the theme song by Cyndi Lauper. This is their second game on NES, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=The+Goonies\">The Goonies</a> being released only for the Famicom system outside the United States.</p>\n<p>You play Mikie, one of the gang members, whose friends have been kidnapped by the gang\u2019s arch enemy \u2013 the Fratelli family. Your buddies and Annie the Mermaid must be rescued, but it won\u2019t be easy sneaking into the dark and creepy underground hideout where they are being held. You must find a way to destroy their master computer and keep your friends from becoming road kill. If Ma Fratelli or crazy Cousin Pipsqueak doesn\u2019t stop you, one of her two crazy sons will!</p>\n<p>Upon starting the game, Mikie is armed only with a yo-yo and the ability to jump. As the game progresses, he will find boomerangs, a gun, bombs, molotave cocktails and even scuba gear to help him. Fight snakes, spiders, skeletons, man-eating fish while exploring the huge world full of cellars, secret caverns and elaborate mazes.</p>\n<p>There is more than typical side-scrolling action, although there\u2019s certainly a multitude of that. Seventeen magic implements and many secret messages await you. When Mikie enters a room he can talk to NPCs and try to find hidden items and doors by hitting the walls. A password lets you keep your possessions for the next game.</p>",

But before he got there, Leroy the Lizardman knocked out Big Nose and stole his savings. When Big Nose woke up and realized his savings were gone, he freaked out! Now he created a wheel with a platform on it and is out to get Leroy. Big Nose Freaks Out is a side scrolling platform action game. There are five sections of gameplay each with four levels to clear. At the end of each section Leroy will be waiting with a large monster. To fight back Big Nose has his trusty club with him. Also, rocks can be found along the way and the club used to bat them at enemies. There are many hidden treasures, hidden levels, and even some level warps to search for.</p>\n<p>The game also features two different two player modes. The <em>Two Player Relay</em> mode has two players taking turns on the normal single player game, Once one player dies in a level, the other player continues where the first player left off. In the <em>Two Player Challenge</em> mode players take turns and each player is given sixty seconds to collect as many bones as they can in five different rounds. The player who collects the most bones wins.</p>",

When that alarm goes off, it means Jason has entered a cabin and you must find him.</p>\n<p>To save time, you can switch between all six counselors, depending on where you are. Once you enter the house that Jason is in, the game switches to a 3D-esque maze in which you have to hurt Jason with the items you collected. Once he's been damaged enough, he'll run away, only to sound another alarm later and enter another house.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In Shockwave you need to retrieve powerful crystals left behind by the Tarian race. The Rastons are after the crystals also, which places a short time limit on the mission. You are armed only with a spacesuit and a shockwave pistol. To retrieve the crystals, you will need to find your way through numerous mazes. Blocks in the maze can be moved with the shockwave pistol. When you hit a block with the pistol, this will move blocks adjacent to the block hit rather than the block itself. If numerous blocks are lined up, the shockwave will continue to travel through the blocks until the path is clear and a block can be moved. Some blocks are indestructable and immovable, while others can be moved, and some completely destroyed. Teleportation doors, force fields and other special items can be found in some mazes. To complete most of the levels the blocks will need to be moved about in the proper order to avoid leaving a critical path permanently blocked. If you do get stuck, there is an option to restart a maze (this feature becomes more and more useful as the game progresses.) Wandering about many of the levels are FireStars which will weaken your spacesuit and eventually destroy it. Each level has a time limit in which to solve the maze and retrieve all of the crystals.</p>",

Now he is back, and Victar must use the sword to defeat him once again.  The game is an arcade style platform game. You begin with just part of the demon sword, and after defeating a large monster at the end of each level an additional section of the sword is restored. After all six missing parts of the sword are found, you can attempt the final level to defeat the Dark Fiend. In addition to the sword pieces, there are other items which can be found during the levels to help out; these include keys to open mystic doors, spheres to restore life, and different types of weapons.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Tiles Of Fate</em> the object of the game is to clear the screen of all the tiles within the given time limit. This is done by selecting two tiles with matching symbols which will cause them to disappear due to the force of symmetry. However, the force of symmetry can only make two right angles at most, and can not pass through other tiles. To clear all the tiles, you will need to plan your moves carefully. To help out, you may discover one of three forces of fate under a tile which can be saved and used when you're stuck. The forces are The Flash of Chance (allows symmetry to affect any matching tiles on the board, even those surrounded by other tiles), The Force of Balance (will eliminate brick walls that block the path of symmetry) and The Flag of Knowledge (this will make your next move for you in case you can't spot what the best move is.) Also included is a level editor which lets you create your own tile challenges.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Rock 'N' Ball is a pinball game with several gameplay options. The first is regular pinball game for one to four players. The second option is called nineball and the object is to shoot the balls into the playfield and have them land in the holes to form a bingo pattern (i.e. a vertical line, a horizontal line, etc.) This game is also for one to four players. Next is battle flipper. There is a set of flippers at both the top and bottom of the table, and two players try to knock the pinball past their opponents flippers. Lastly is sports pinball. In this game the pinball table is set up to look like a soccer or hockey field. Similar to battle flipper, each player tries to knock the pinball past their opponents goalie. There is only one flipper in this game, however you have a goalie to block shots and the flipper can be moved from side to side.</p>",

Throughout the levels there are five diamonds you must collect which are needed to complete the final level and rescue Jennifer, with plenty of obstacles and enemies to get in the way. During the game Mr. Stevenson continuously walks to the right and you have to use the light gun to save him from any obstacles blocking his path. Some obstacles can be destroyed with the light gun, others Mr. Stevenson will need to jump over (shooting him with the light gun will cause him to jump.) You have a limited amount of ammo, but more can be obtained by popping the balloons which are scattered throughout the levels.</p>",

It's a suit of flight armor that allows the guardian to survive any environment.  It's a good thing too, because a giant space station is spotted on a collision course with Earth.</p>\n<p>You take the role of the guardian.  Your mission is to activate the station's self-destruct and destroy it before it collides with Earth.  As you travel through the station NAJU, you'll find increased armor and better weapons to help you defeat waves of enemies.  You'll battle through the station in a human form and also as a jet in certain areas.</p>\n<p>There's also a hidden mode that allows you to play the game in Arcade fashion - only autoscrolling overhead shooting levels, without the on-foot part. New weapons and upgrades are automatically awarded after each level depending on the player's total score. Dying resets the score to zero.</p>",

The game recreates the pinball table and gameplay from the arcade version and also adds some video game features, such as lightning bombs, attacking enemies, magnetic helicopters, and rust balls which dissolve your flipper. The bottom part of the screen remains on the bottom set of flippers, while the top half scrolls over the whole pinball table to follow the action. Gameplay is for one to four players alternating.</p>",

There are even entire planets dedicated to manufacturing new robots. But then an alien race captured one of the robot manufacturing planets and reprogrammed the robots to destroy humans! Now it's up to you to go in and take back the planet. Using a low gravity backpack, you have the ability to jump higher than normally possible. You also have a wide variety of weapons to help battle the robots guarding the planet, and additional weapons can be found by destroying certain robots.  Some robots will be riding in vehicles. If you destroy the driver, you can capture the vehicle to help you out on your mission.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dragon Warrior IV</em> is the fourth game in the <em>Dragon Quest</em> series. The game utilizes a chapter system, where each chapter is dedicated to the personal stories of one or several main characters. The first four chapters tell the stories of the soldier Ragnar (Ryan in the original Japanese version), who sets off to investigate the disappearance of children in a nearby village; Alena, the princess of Santeem Kingdom, who dreams to become a martial artist; Cristo and Brei (Klift and Burai), a priest from the Santeem Castle and a magician who watched over the princess when she was younger; the weapon dealer Taloon (Torneko), who wants to become the best in business; and the two sisters Mara and Nara (Minea and Manya), who search for the person who murdered their father. In the fifth (and by far the longest) chapter, the Hero (or the Heroine) of the game finally appears on the stage to tie all the loose ends together and lead the party to the ultimate battle against their adversary.</p>\n<p>The rest of the game is played fairly similarly to the previous installments of the series. The party roams the top-down world in a relatively non-linear fashion, though certain events must be triggered in order to advance the story and access some of the important areas. A ship and a balloon are among the transportation methods that the heroes acquire over the course of the game. Randomly appearing enemies must be dispatched in turn-based combat, using familiar attacks and spells common to the entire series. Characters deal more or less damage depending on their position in the party lineup. They can also be swapped during battles. With the exception of the current main protagonist, the characters in the party are controlled by the AI; the player is only able to assign general tactics to them.</p>",

Critters of all sorts will fill up the game board and you need to move them around to line up creatures of the same type before the entire board becomes filled. Depending on the type of creature, you will need to line up 3, 4, 5, or 6 of the same type of creature for them to disappear. After you have cleared a certain number of creatures, the board will stop filling up and you have a limited amount of time to try to clear as many creatures as possible for bonus points. As the levels progress the game board changes shape and will fill up faster and faster with different creatures.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The evil space wizard Krohn has mastered the power to control a black hole, and plans on using this power to control the universe. You are an explorer on assignment in a remote corner of the universe. You have just been reassigned to fight Krohn since your ship, the Millennium Orb, is the only space craft cabable of withstanding Krohn's black hole. To defeat Krohn, you must get past 30 different chambers blocking the path. On the left and right side of each chamber are force fields which you must maneuver to keep the Millennium orb within the chamber. Each chamber contains a plane in the center with various targets, around which the Orb will travel. You can make the Orb dive out of it's orbital path into the plane and hit the targets. To complete each chamber you need to complete a goal with the targets (often you will need to figure out a way to clear them all.) The Millenium Orb has a limited amount of feul, however, which will be used up over time and in even greater quantities should you miss the Orb with the force fields. When fuel is low, you can head to Vern's Orb-O-Rama and use earned credits to refuel your Orb. </p>\n<p>Included with the game is a pair of 3-D glasses which can give the game a more 3 dimensional appearance, though they aren't required for gameplay.</p>\n<p>Due to gameplay similarities this game is often considered a follow-up of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/669/beyond-the-black-hole/\">Beyond the Black Hole</a>.</p>",

You will need to pilot your ship, The Tempest, to the planets Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Earth in order to retrieve certain minerals which can be used to fight the Raggosians. The Raggosians will be trying to stop you from reaching these destinations, though, so you need to use the Nintendo zapper to fight back. Numerous (and very fast!) enemy ships will fly by on the screen and attempt to destroy your ship. You need to shoot the ships and incoming missiles before your ship takes too much damage. From time to time a comet will fly by, and if you shoot this a temporary barrier will be formed that protects your ship from enemy fire. Occasionally you can also earn a smart bomb which appears in the bottom of the screen and destroys all enemies if shot. Each level ends with a large boss which will take multiple hits to destroy.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Anticipation</em> is a video board game for one to four players (both computer and human). The object of the game is to be the first to collect a card for each of the four colors on the game board. During each turn the computer will display seemingly random dots, then a pencil starts connecting the dots to form a picture. The first player to correctly identify the picture will earn a card for the color of the picture being drawn. As the picture draws, a dice on the screen will count down from 6 to 1. Whatever value is showing when a player successfully identifies the picture is the number of spaces that players game piece will move on the game board for the next turn. The color of the space the game piece lands on will dictate the category for the next picture to be drawn. </p>\n<p>Each game will choose four categories from the various options, which include: tools, man made, clothing, food, math, office, travel, music, things, natural, leisure, and many others. After you've mastered the easier skill levels, the difficulty can be increased which will present more complicated pictures, remove some of the dots from the picture, or eliminate the dots entirely. </p>\n<p>The game supports one to four players, however the NES satellite is not supported. If three or four players are competing, then two players will need to share a single controller. The control pad or A/B buttons would ring in a player who knew the answer for the picture being drawn, then the controller would have to be handed to that player in order to enter in the answer.</p>",

A party is formed by selecting up to five officers from a huge pool, many of whom would only join you after be bribed or defeated in combat. Officers in turn each have a certain amount of soldiers, which essentially acted as hit points (i.e. Sima Ye leads 40000 men, and when he is hit by Zhang Bao, he loses 5000 men, so his manpower is now at 35000).</p>",

        "description": "<p>Just like in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/36808/top-gun/\">the first game</a>, you fly an F-14 Tomcat in combat against the enemy equipped with Soviet equipment, although there is no direct reference to the Soviet Union anywhere. The only plot of this game is to destroy everything you see, excluding the aircraft carrier to which you must land at the end of each level.</p>\n<p>In addition to the basic game mode with anti-ship, ground attack and space battle levels, similar to the first game, the second mission adds two extra modes. In the first extra mode you can fight against top enemy aces flying a MiG-25 Foxbat, one at a time. The second extra mode is two-player game with split screen, in which you can fight against your friend, both flying Tomcats.</p>\n<p>You will have to fight against interesting level bosses such as a giant Tu-160 Blackjack bomber, a Mi-24 Hind attack chopper and an armed space shuttle.</p>\n<p>Another interesting detail about the game is that between fighting the aircraft and surface opponents you have to dodge between giant trees (yes, you read correctly!!), lightnings and laser attacks.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the year 2XXX A.D., Earth is under attack from the aliens of Planet X. Armed with monsters of terrible destructive force, the invaders establish bases on every planet of the solar system. These monsters include the foes Gezora, Moguera, Baragon, Varan, Hedorah, Gigan, Mecha-Godzilla and King Ghidora. To combat the menace, Earth sends two of it's own monsters, Godzilla and Mothra, in order to drive back the invaders of Planet X.</p>\n<p><em>Godzilla</em> is a game of alternating turns between the player and the AI. On each turn, the player may select either Godzilla or Mothra and move them across a hex field map taking place on one of the planets of the solar system. Any tiles of the hex field that are crossed must be battled through by the selected monster during an action sequence with side-scrolling gameplay: dodging obstacles or destroying them, battling smaller enemies and evading projectiles. Enemies and obstacles encountered depend on the terrain type, which include mountainous, jungle, volcano, alien city, underwater and special. Encounters against enemy monsters on the map may also take place. These boss battles last 90 seconds, with either one side's monster being defeated or the turn ending.</p>\n<p>Mothra can move four tiles each turn and has additional mobility through her flying. She fires red laser bolts from her eyes and can unleash special pollen bombs that she drops at an angle downwards. Godzilla can only move two tiles each turn but is the stronger creature. He can punch, kick, swipe with his tail, jump and unleash radioactive breath on everything in front of him.</p>",

Because Godzilla is such a ferocious monster, this is no easy task... in fact, your attacks to Godzilla don't actually do any damage to him at all. Strategy instead becomes the main point of play as you must position forces in strategic points to route Godzilla away from important buildings and into other areas where his movement will be less destructive to the city. Actual success of these routing attacks is imperfect, if one is not careful, the whole offensive will fall apart over a single missed attack.\nBeware Godzilla!</p>",

Stuck in the world of espionage among such groups as the FBI and the CIA, Golgo is constantly in mortal danger, and a lethal weapon in his own right. </p>\n<p><em>The Mafat Conspiracy</em> is the sequel to the NES game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10244/golgo-13-top-secret-episode/\">Top Secret Episode</a>. In this chapter, Golgo must track down a missing satellite from the SDI laser defense system, as well as rescue a top scientist and stop those who would use the satellite for blackmail and terror on the world's nations. </p>\n<p>While Golgo is outdoors, the game is a side-scrolling romp where the player can fire and jump. This changes when Golgo enters a building, at which point the game switches to a first person 3D maze. Navigating past soldiers and between floors, Golgo collects various clues to advance the storyline. There is also a driving sequence, and several sniper sequences in which precision aiming is required.</p>",

Faced with extinction at the hands of a temporal paradox, Marty must find a way to reunite his future parents and make it back to his own time.</p>\n<p>LJN's game differs completely from the computer versions, and plays as a literal race against time broken up by brief arcade minigames. In the main game, the player controls Marty in an overhead view as he runs down the streets of 1950s Hill Valley. A collection of period-appropriate bad guys block his path, including bullies, hula hoop girls, bumblebees, and park benches. The camera scrolls forward at a fixed speed, so the player must keep Marty on the move and away from obstacles. Hitting one causes Marty to fall and lose a life. The player must also collect clocks scattered on the street to stop Marty's photograph from fading away. If it fades completely, Marty is erased from existence.</p>\n<p>Street running sections lead to three minigames. In these, Marty must sling milkshakes at oncoming bullies, deflect kisses (shown as hearts) from his mother, and collect notes to rock out on stage at the high school dance. The final stage resembles the street sections, as the player must control the DeLorean time machine and collect enough energy to travel through time (shown as lightning bolts instead of clocks).</p>",

The game has two leagues - the Ultra and Super leagues - with 12 teams that represent major league cities which use fictional team and player names. There are several modes to choose from at the start of the game. You can play a One Player tournament versus the computer: pick a team and play against every other team once. Or, you can play a three-game series against a friend. There's also an all-star mode, which enables you to build a 23-player team from the rosters of one of the leagues. And if you want to watch a game, there's a spectator mode.</p>",

And when you step up to the plate in this cart you'll find the wackiest bunch of players to ever hit a softball diamond!</p>\n<p>Play seven inning fast or slow-pitch games. In One Player mode, you face the computer in a five-game elimination tournament. Win them all, and you earn the right to challenge the awesome Amazons - All-Star Softball's all-time championship team. Of course, you and a friend can play each other in a head-to-head contest.</p>\n<p>There are no preset ball clubs so you recruit 10-member squad from a roster of 60 weird players. Look for players who have strong basic baseball skills such as arm strength and speed. But to win on some of the tricky fields you'll also need players with more unusual skills - such as climbing fences, diving into water, and flying at night</p>\n<p>In fast pitch, you hurl that baby in three speeds. But stay alert, base runners steal and batters bunt. In slow pitch, you can lob the ball short or long. You can also make your pitches curve right or left.Fielding the ball takes practice, but your guys can also dive for hard grounders and leap up to snare line shots. For quick double plays, infielders can tag a base then throw the ball.</p>\n<p>With six softball fields to choose from, including the Sandlot, the Cliff, and a Professional field, there's some great action. Get ready to take yourself out to the softball park.</p>",

You can play a one player \"Ranking\" mode, where you can build your boxer's stats up while climbing the ladder to eventually challenge for a championship in one of the four weight classes. There is also a two player vs. mode where you and a friend can square off. A tournament mode allows up to 8 players participate in a bracketed tournament.</p>\n<p>Gameplay consists of each boxer moving around the ring trying to land jabs, hooks, and uppercuts.

This game is mostly a platform game with some overhead driving to get to the different buildings in search of clues.</p>\n<p>There are five different weapons in the game: hand gun, tommy gun, super punch, tear gas and Tracy's plain fists. There are also medical kits that can be found. Enemies can be armed or unarmed. If Tracy shoots an unarmed thug, he loses health.</p>\n<p>The main goal of the game is to collect five clues; enough to be able to arrest the culprit. Clues are scattered all over town in various buildings, usually full of Tracy-hating thugs. You start by viewing the mug shots of known criminals, going to there last whereabouts and interrogating them.</p>",

In One-Player mode you play the computer in an international tournament. For Two Players, you each have a squad in the tourney. All games are seven innings long.</p>\n<p>To help you pick a team, Power Analysis screen enables you to see how teams rate on hitting, pitching, overall defense, and running.</p>\n<p>When you're up to bat you can move around in the box, control your swing, and bunt. Pitcher's have a choice of fastball and changeup, and curving the ball left and right. On defense, all players can dive for balls or jump up to snare line drives. A great defensive plus here is the ability to move players into pre-set defensive shifts, for example, to defend against pull hitters or bunts</p>\n<p>The game was originally released in Japan as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/55242/koshien/\">K\u014dshien</a> which only featured Japanese teams.</p>",

But you can also upgrade your engine and tires - if you can afford it, which means you'll have to think seriously about gathering those dollar signs scattered on the track. The tracks themselves have more variety, some have unusual enemies (little planes bombing you from above), and more kinds of obstacles. You also have several lives and don't die immediately if you arrived last.</p>",

Check your score card to see how you're doing. The card tells you the distance in yards and par for each hole. The computer gives you a bird's-eye view and cross-sectional view of each hole, as well as close-ups of the green. You select the right club for each shot. Control your shot to get the power, distance, and hook or slice you want on the ball. After you've made your shot the computer tells you what kind of lie you have as well as the remaining distance to the hole.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>WWF Wrestlemania</em> is a wrestling game using the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) license. The game features six popular WWF wrestlers: Hulk Hogan, Andr\u00e9 the Giant, \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage, The Honky Tonk Man, Bam Bam Bigelow, and \"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase.</p>\n<p>All the wrestlers can execute basic punches, kicks, and headbutts; turnbuckle moves and bodyslams can only be performed by particular wrestlers. Different wrestlers may use different moves with varying frequency, reflecting the preferences of their real-life counterparts. Wrestlers might also become angry (turning red on the screen), entering a rage state during which their attack power improves. Character-specific health power-ups will sometimes appear on the ring, and can be collected by corresponding wrestlers.</p>\n<p>The two gameplay modes include a single exhibition match (one player versus the computer or two players against each other), and a tournament. In a single player tournament, the player chooses one wrestler and must defeat the other five in a series of matches to win the championship. In a tournament with up to six player-controlled wrestlers, each wrestler faces every other wrestler one time, for a total of fifteen matches.</p>",

The motive is that his wife, Jessica Rabbit had been photographed playing patty-cake with him. Obviously this kind of affair is enough to drive a man, or rabbit, into killing. But he didn't do it and now there seems to be some kind of mystery surrounding Marvin Acme's last will and testament... and with it, ownership of Toontown. In order to clear his name, Roger has  enlisted the help of Eddie Valliant, no-nonsense detective. Together they'll need to search through Hollywood, Toontown, the Wilderness and Toontown in an effort to find the pieces to Marvin's original will and stop the evil Judge Doom and his henchmen, the Weasels.</p>\n<p>You play this game as the Private Investigator, Eddie Valliant, while Roger Rabbit wanders around the scenery behind you. Your job is to search the city for clues, items and punchlines to jokes which will be your only defense should the Weasels catch up to poor Roger. Except for these Weasels (and birds flying overhead), Roger is more or less invincible as a toon. That means for most of the gameplay, he will be ignored. Should the Weasels appear in an area with you however (with an alarm sounding as they get close), Roger will go bug-eyed and try to run away. It is then up to Eddie to keep the Weasels away from Roger or engage in knock-knock jokes should they happen to catch him.</p>\n<p>The bulk of the gameplay takes place on side-scrolling areas that represent city blocks, caves and room interiors. There is also a top-view world map where you navigate between areas on foot or via Benny the Cab.</p>",

Only he's not a man, he is a lycanthrope, a person able to transform into a terrible werewolf to let loose his anger.</p>\n<p>You start the game in human form. The human can punch, jump, move and shoot a powered up shot which moves horizontally across the screen.  By finding a Red \"W\" icon, the human is able to transform into a mighty werewolf creature. Accidentally grabbing a blue \"W\" icon or losing too much energy will change you back into a mere human being. The werewolf form offers higher jumps, quicker speed, greater strength, a shockwave attack and the ability to climb walls, so naturally you'll want this form whenever possible.  Additionally the werewolf form has an anger meter that is augmented by collecting orbs. After 5 such orbs, the werewolf will transform yet again into a SUPER werewolf with even greater strength, speed and partial invincibility.</p>\n<p>There are 5 stages in all. Each with a boss who moves in a distinct pattern.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Ghoul School</em> the player is cast as Spike O'Hara, a senior at Cool School High in a small American town. Spike is a rebel and an outcast, but is a good kid. While taking a shortcut through the graveyard home one day, he comes across a glowing skull. Intrigued, he takes it to Dr. Femur, his anatomy teacher, the next day, which happens to be the day before Halloween. Dr. Femur wants to keep it for an overnight study, and Spike reluctantly agrees, noticing that the skull appeared bigger than the day before.</p>\n<p>During the night, the skull begins transmitting a message to the realm of the dead. On Halloween, the dead begin their assault. The teachers and students inside are turned into zombies and demons under the control of whatever intelligence has taken over the school. Samantha Pom-Pom, the head cheerleader, is captured by the dead and held somewhere inside the school. Paranormal eliminators and members of the football team have ventured inside to find her, but have not returned. When Spike learns of the mess from the TV news, he rushes to the school and decides to rescue her himself.</p>\n<p>Spike ventures inside. The doors shut and lock behind him. There's no turning back now.</p>\n<p>Spike begins his quest with only his trusty baseball bat and battered sneakers, but can collect better weapons and shoes along the way. Among them are the straightforward sickle, embalming fluid, towel and almighty gamma gun, the strange Deweytron and taserlike Spinal Zap, and a sandwich (if it can be used as a weapon, they should have fired the cafeteria workers a LONG time ago), among other weapons. Useful items include the spring shoes, needed to reach high places, the suction shoes, which allow you to walk on the ceiling, and the Golden Apple, needed to bypass the Medusa head guarding the way to the second half of the school.</p>\n<p>Get going! You have 129 rooms to explore and Samantha is counting on you. Good luck.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Dr. Chaos was your typical mad scientist. He owned an extensive mansion and spent his time experimenting within it on things that mankind was never meant to know. His latest invention is an Interdimensional Warpgate which allows access to worlds beyond our own. As the doctor's younger brother, Michael, you arrive at Dr.Chaos' mansion one day to find the place crawling with strange mutant creatures. To make matters worse, the mansion itself isn't looking too good. Strange \"holes\" into other dimensions have opened up and made a mess of the architecture. Furthermore, Dr.Chaos himself is missing.</p>\n<p>The game takes place as a platform game where you must use various weapons (knife, pistol, machine pistol or grenade) to fight your way past mutants and into various rooms of the mansion. Once in these rooms, the view changes to a first person maze...  and you'll need to open various cabinets, doors and hit walls in special places to find access into a dimensional hole. Once you enter the dimensional hole, the game once again becomes a platform game, where you will need to fight your way to the end of the level and defeat a boss monster of some sort to obtain a piece of the Warpgate. Then you'll have to proceed BACK through the level and return to the mansion, where you'll explore to find the next dimensional hole.</p>",

As Amagon, you begin the game with only a machine gun and a limited amount of ammo to protect yourself from the inhabitants of the island. Gameplay is an arcade style platform game with six levels, each with a variety of creatures and a large boss at the end. When you destroy an enemy, a power up will sometimes be left behind. Collecting these can give you extra points, an extra life, more ammo, or a mega key. If you have enough points and collect a mega key, you then have the ability to transform into Megagon. In this form, you are larger in size, can jump further, and have increased strength. You start the transformation with an amount of mega points; each time a creature injures you, points are lost. When all of the mega points are gone you will transform back into your normal size.</p>",

But Black Bomberman knocked White Bomberman to the ground, and than left the money so that he would be framed. Now Bomberman has been taken to jail and must fight his way out of this place using the only method he knows: explosive bombs.</p>\n<p>Bomberman is the second Bomberman game in the series and plays similar to the first, only all gameplay has been reduced to a single screen. Your goal however remains the same on a smaller playing area. You are to destroy all enemies on a level and then find the exit to the next one. Bombing the exit is always a bad idea. The occasional power-up will increase your bomb blast, number of bombs on the screen at one time, player speed or give you the ability to walk through walls.</p>\n<p>In addition to the single Player game, Bomberman II introduces a Versus Mode for 2 players and a Battle Mode for 3. Your goal in these is to destroy the other players while staying alive yourself.</p>",

The player assumes the role of Willow, the chosen one who must restore human form to the benevolent sorceress Fin Raziel and destroy the evil sorceress, Bavmorda. While the game follows the movie's plot somewhat most of the time, it also expands on it and introduces characters, races and enemies not found in the movie.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is similar to other action RPGs and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=The+Legend+of+Zelda\">The Legend of Zelda</a>. Willow is seen from a top down perspective and all enemies are visible on screen. Slaying enemies will give Willow experience points, which will eventually lead to him increasing his stats automatically. New weapons, shields and magic items are found in various treasure chests scattered across the land or given to Willow as part of the plot. Aside from battling minor enemies Willow will also face off against several boss monsters as well as characters from the movie.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the 24th century, the game of Baseball is very different. Tired of paying huge players salaries, the team owners got together one weekend and came up with a bold new idea, Robots. Indeed they renamed their league the Cyber League and stocked it with four robot types; Cyborg, Tank, Floater or Motorcycle, to play.  On an orbital stadium in space, these robots all play a slightly different variation of the baseball rules. Hitting the ball and catching pop-flys and making home runs are all the same, but when the call of a play is in dispute, there are no base referees; the robots engage in a one-on-one battle using any weaponry they're carrying.  Of course to make things interesting, weaponry (and other robot parts and equipment) can only be purchased with team funds during a tournament game, and team funds can only be obtained by wins. Thus the series closer is always sure to be a sold out game.</p>",

After this qualification, you go into a side perspective head to head race, where you have to push left and right continuously. In this view there are all sorts of events, including Car Crush, Mud Race and Drag Race. Before these races, you can (read: must) also buy upgrades for your cars, with the money you collected in the qualify race.</p>\n<p>The game is supported to play 2 players.</p>",

He is given the task by Vice-Director Matic, of finding another captured strider, Kain. But rather than mount a rescue, Hiryu is told his assignment is to kill Kain. Hiryu questions these orders and travels to Kain's last known location to try to find him...</p>\n<p><em>Strider</em> is a platform game where Hiryu must fight his way past enemies and uncover keys, characters and data disks (which can be analysed aboard the Blue Dragon) to find out what's going on. His primary weapon is his jumping ability and sword, the Cypher, which he uses to strike with great speed. At some point in the game, the Cypher may be modified to shoot plasma arrows. Hiryu also has a various set of \"skills\" which he learns as he gains levels. Examples of skills are a healing ability (Medical), a jumping ability (Jump), some additional attacks (Spark, Fire, Sp-Ball) and the ability to leave an area (Warp).</p>",

When conventional defense tactics fail, the Federation looks to find a specially selected person, Hal Bailman and equip him with a special \"Lightship\". His mission will to be to fly through the defenses of the eight known Air Fortresses and dock at the airlock. Then he must travel through the fortress in only a spacesuit to find and destroy the central core. Once the central core is destroyed, Hal must then quickly find the emergency lightship and escape before the fortress explodes.</p>\n<p>The game is made up of two parts. The first part is a side-scrolling shooter on the surface of the air fortress where you must avoid various flying enemies and try to destroy as many waves as possible. This lasts until you dock with the airlock. Once docked, you walk the inside of the Air Fortress at your own pace. Hal is equipped with a jetpack rather than a jump as well as a blaster weapon and a more powerful bomb weapon. Any movement or firing you do consumes energy which is regenerated by standing still. Your goal is to blow up the core and find the escape ship before explosion.</p>\n<p>Power-ups to increase Energy or Bombs can be found in each part of the game. Additionally, Super-bombs (clear screen of enemies) and Invulnerability can be found while flying the lightship.</p>",

Gangreen from unleashing his Doomsday Tomato. With all the citizens of San Zucchini terrified of the fanged vegetables coming from the sewers, Chad will be on his own to take on the tomato scourge. The doctor doesn't take him lightly, however, and has sent his special tomato squad, Zoltan, Beefstake, Mummato, Fang, Ketchuck and Tomacho, to stop him.</p>\n<p>The game is a side-scrolling platform jumping game where the main method of stopping the killer tomatoes is to jump on them. From that they'll either splatter, run away or transform into smaller tomato bits. Energy Power-ups exist to refill Chad's health.</p>",

Using magnetic powers, he soon turns the people of the United States into zombies and exerts influence over various weapons and objects. Among the weapons Darc Seed claims is the legendary samurai sword, Shura. When the great head of the samurai, Namakubi hears about this, he sets out for the United States to defeat Darc Seed and reclaim the sword.</p>\n<p><em>Zombie Nation</em> is a side-scrolling shooter in which the player can control Namakubi's movement across the screen and the ability to shoot. The hero's designation as a \"great head of the samurai\" is to be taken literally: Namakubi is indeed a giant disembodied head. His main weapon is the ability to shoot projectiles from his eyes and bombs from his mouth which he fires at various enemies, objects and buildings. Furthermore, should a zombie hostage fall out a window he can rescue them to slowly power up his attacks. Enemies reduce health by varying amounts; health can be restored by increasing the player's score. The game features four distinct stages with two difficulty settings.</p>",

The ghostbusters quest, like in the movie, takes them to an underground river of slime, ghostly hauntings in the courthouse, an abandoned subway line. These action sequences are interspersed with driving sequences with the Ghostbusters car, Ecto-1A  Finally, the Ghostbusters must bring the Statue of Liberty to life through the New York Harbor and then navigate it through the city streets. This leads to a final confrontation with a painting come-to-life, Virgo the Carpathian in which all 4 ghostbuster members must fight their way into the museum.</p>\n<p>In the action sequences you control a single ghostbuster who can fire his slime weapon and jump. In driving sequences you move the Ecto-1A around the screen and your controls are also a slime gun and jumping. Additionally you must find speed arrows on the ground to jump over huge chasms. Finally, while controlling the Statue of Liberty you may fire her torch straight up into the air (find a power-up torch to shoot diagonally) or let loose the tablet that she carries to destroy all enemies on the screen.</p>\n<p>Find 20 \"Ghostbusters 2\" symbols in any of these levels to obtain an extra life.</p>",

The X-Men: Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm, Colossus, Iceman and Nightcrawler, are ready to fight Magneto.</p>\n<p><em>The Uncanny X-Men</em> is an over-head view action game. Players begin by choosing two X-Men from the roster (the second either controlled by another player or the computer) and select one of five levels including a practice level. The goal in each level is to reach the hidden 'command center' and destroy it. The X-Men all share similar abilities, being able to move in any direction, jump and attack. Half of the characters (Storm, Iceman, Cyclops) have long range attacks while the other half (Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Colossus) must get in close range to punch the enemies. Each X-men can only sustain a certain number of hits before being defeated. Should the two X-Men both fall in battle, players will be able to choose two more to attempt the level again until all of the X-Men are used up.</p>\n<p>Power-ups include an \"S\" which stops time, invincibility for a short time and a health restore. There is also a Magnet (symbol of Magneto) power-down which renders the X-men immobile for a short time.</p>",

Instead of Sonic, the player controls Somari, which can be described as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Mario+Licensees\">Mario</a> in Sonic's shoes, literally.</p>\n<p>Overall, the gameplay is quite faithful to the original game, though Somari can spindash (by pressing down and A or B), a feature fist introduced in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Sonic+the+Hedgehog+2\">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>. Somari has to collect rings, but unlike in <em>Sonic</em>, if he's hit by an enemy, only three rings will fly out of him, no matter how many rings he's currently carrying.</p>\n<p>The level sequence is faithful to the original game, with the exception of the Scrap Brain level, which wasn't finished and thus was removed from the final product. The level design ins't faithful to the original version, with constant changes throughout the game. The items and monsters are the same found in the original game, and the music is as faithfully translated to the NES as possible, with some <em>tempo</em> variations.</p>",

In the regular game, you have to stack up the colored discs as fast as possible and in a certain pattern and sequence. In memory mode you program an entire sequence of movements to move the discs and won't know if it actually works until you RUN the program. Finally there is a 1 or 2 player bingo mode in which you align different columns and rows to BINGO and activate rob commands. An opponent will also hop around activating commands.

By following their projected route, KITT and Michael must race across the roadways of the United States.</p>\n<p>Riding in KITT down the highways, you'll be trying to beat the clock to reach your destinations mostly. KITT, however is the car of the future and doesn't go about unarmed. A Gun weapon, Missiles, Laser and a Jumping ability will all help you. KITT absorbs damage in it's internal shielding and once that's gone, you lose a life. However Devon has contacted other agents of FLAG who will be on the same roadways and will drop power-ups to restore ammo and shields to KITT.</p>",

They want to sell it to the government's department of defense as it would pose a threat to the security of the nation if it is sold to a foreign country. They have asked the president, who is actually an alien from outer space, to consider their offer and respond in one week. The government takes this matter very seriously, and assigns Nova to destroy the Delta Foundation. Unfortunately, the government cannot be involved in the event that something might happen to him.</p>\n<p><em>Power Blade 2</em> has six stages which involve you running through the level, while killing off enemies and avoiding hazards. At the start, you can choose which stage to start at, but unlike <em>Power Blade</em>, once you have chosen a stage, you can't exit and choose another one until you have completed the current one first. Nearly each stage involves you using your wits, as you dodge spikes, jumping towards the top of the screen to avoid fire, and getting fans to lift you onto platforms. You can also slide your way through tight spots, as long as you slide in the right place.</p>\n<p>At the end of each stage, you fight a different boss. However, in the end, you must fight all the bosses you fought before you get to fight the alien leader.</p>",

In the adventure, you are in a small community called Elmood. You play as the hero in this game. Basically you are trying to keep skateboarding and your life as it was after the Mayor of the town bans skateboards. After dealing with this, you set out to build your own halfpipe, and you deal with whatever comes your way. In this game, you go through many obstacles, and other skateboarders shooting paint and throwing eggs at you, you also can shoot at them, and of course upgrade your board from Lester when you run into him on his skateboard, as well as Lester who will give you tricks (giving them whatever they want, whether that's fries, drinks, CD's, etc;).</p>",

The stranded people on the island are: Gilligan and the Skipper ( the crew of the ship), a millionaire and his wife, a professor, and Mariann who is a homely Midwest U.S.A. girl.</p>\n<p>Despite the name, you'll be playing as the Skipper. Gilligan follows you around as a comedic relief sidekick. The game is divided into four episodes; the goal is always to locate all crew members in a limited amount of time. To do so the two heroes have to navigate the maze-like island and collect items - every found character provides hints for the next step.</p>\n<p>There are also a lot of dangers which have to be faced: wild animals and headhunters can be fought with your bare hands and fallen rocks or obstacles on the ground have to be avoided. A common nuisance are holes in the ground which lead to the underground caves: Gilligan is likely to fall into these. If this happens Skipper has two minutes to get Gilligan back. There are three items which help Skipper on his quest: bananas replenish his health, hourglasses give extra time and the rope is used to get Gilligan back instantly.</p>",

Professor Imes was a famous archaeologist particularly interested in the old Mayan civilization. Having heard of a powerful artifact known as the Sun Key, which is apparently able to unlock the secrets of the Maya, professor assembled a team and traveled to the ruins of Chichen Itza. However, he and his team have mysterious disappeared; only his guide Jose was able to escape, delivering the news to the professor's daughter. </p>\n<p>Unlike in the original release, the player character travels to the Yucatan with the daughter of Professor Imes and the guide Jose. Both have special abilities which are sometimes needed to solve puzzles: the young woman is musically talented, and Jose is able to move heavy objects. Due to these changes, some of the locations and puzzles have been altered in this version.</p>\n<p>Another significant gameplay change is the introduction of role-playing elements. Solving puzzles and defeating demons in turn-based combat grants the protagonist experience points. Even though combat is very sparse in the game, taking on stronger foes can be futile if the player hasn't gathered enough experience by completing other tasks beforehand.</p>",

Your only defense is a candle weapon which you can throw to extinguish any of the enemy creatures.</li>\n<li><strong>Big Thunder Mountain Railroad</strong> - Travelling from the top of the screen downwards, you must navigate a minecart onto various tracks looking for the path that will lead to the third station and the key. Obstacles and dead ends can bring this ride to an end.</li>\n<li><strong>Pirates of the Caribbean</strong> - A side-scrolling platform game. Your objective is to sneak past a horde of pirates and rescue six captives, after that, light a signal fire to obtain the key. The only thing that will stop the pirates directly is the ability to roll barrels into them and knock them over.</li>\n<li><strong>Autopia</strong> - On the racetrack, Panhandle Pete will send all of his auto goons at you. Avoiding these cars as well as other obstacles and jumping over pits will bring you to the finish line to collect the key.</li>\n<li><strong>Space Mountain</strong> - Inside the Space Mountain Rollercoaster, follow the track from the cockpit and listen to Mickey's navigational aids regarding which directions it will turn. Try not to hit the walls and eventually you're reach section F and the key</li>\n<li><strong>Disney Trivia</strong> - The last key is hidden amongst Mickey Mouse's \"friends\" who will ask you to prove your comradery by answering several different trivia questions regarding the Walt Disney company and the company's productions.</li>\n</ul>",

You control Dino-Riki from a top-down perspective as the screen scrolls towards the top. Dino Riki must shoot the enemies in his way as well as leap over pits and avoid obstacles. His chances improve when he obtains weapon power-ups such as fireballs or boomerangs. Angel Wings also help and let Dino Riki fly above the ground. At the end of each level, Dino-Riki faces off against a boss creature.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Unlike its namesake, the IndyCar racer <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/355425/al-unser/\"> Al Unser Jr.</a>, this game depicts Formula 1 races. A season consists of sixteen races, each one consisting of unlimited practice, one qualifying lap and the real race (the starting position depends on the qualifying result). Of course the goal is to win the championship by having successful race results. Those results also change the amount of \"set-up points\", which represent the quality of the car, players can use before the next race. Besides the championship there is also a time trial mode available (with or without AI opponents).</p>\n<p>While the game features manual gear switching, it tends more to an action oriented gameplay than a simulation: pit stops (needed when the car gets nearly destroyed after accidents) stop the time for every driver and players can use a limited amount of turbo boosts. Players can start their own racing team or play as Al Unser Jr., which results in always having the best car possible.</p>",

It follows the events that occur after the evil Radditz tells Son Goku, the series' main hero, about his true origin as a Saiyajin, and suggests uniting their powers. As Son Goku refuses, a battle takes place, and the defeated Radditz threatens to harm Son Goku's son, Son Gohan. Many friends come to help Son Goku, and even his rival Piccolo joins forces with him. But the quest leads them much further - to the ultimate battle against the leader of Saiyajin...</p>\n<p>In this fighting/RPG game, you control multiple characters from the series: Son Goku, Piccolo, Krillin, Yamcha, Tienshinhan, Chao-Zu, and Son Gohan. You have to train each character by taking him to battles. All the movements in the game, in battle as well as on the field, occur by collecting and choosing cards of various strength. You move around by selecting a card, and can advance a certain amount of fields depending on its value. You train characters in special training stations before taking them to fights. Once you have trained your character and chose the cards, the battles flow automatically, as cinematic sequences that show Son Goku and his foes exchanging blows while flying.</p>",

Following the events depicted in the manga series those games are based on, \"Hot Battle\" picks up the story right where it ended in the previous game: in the ultimate battle, Son Goku defeated Freezer, the evil Planet Destroyer. However, Freezer's brother Cooler swears revenge. Son Goku and his friends have once again to fight the evil in order to keep the miraculous Dragon Balls.</p>\n<p>In this game, you control many characters from the anim\u00e9 series, including Son Goku, Son Gohan, Krillin, Piccolo, Yamcha, Trunk, and even the archrival Vegeta, who has now joined the team. In battles, you have three active characters, but you can switch and train them in between. The RPG system is similar to the one used in the first two games: your movements on the field and during battles are determined by the type of cards you choose from several available ones. The cinematic battle sequences are now more fast-paced, and there are many mini-games to speed up the leveling up.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The second in the Dragon Ball Z RPG series, \"Freezer the Planet Destroyer\", as it is often unofficially translated, follows closely the popular manga series and continues the story of the first Dragon Ball Z RPG, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Saiyajin\"> Assault of Saiyajins</a>. After the fight against the Saiyajin leader Vegeta, Son Goku, the series' main hero, is heavily wounded, while his ally Piccolo is dead. Son Goku's son Son Gohan and his friends go to the planet Namek to find the magical Dragon Balls that would bring Piccolo back to life. The trouble is, Vegeta is heading to the planet, and so does the evil Freezer, who is also after the Dragon Balls...</p>\n<p>You control both Son Gohan's and Son Goku's parties, including popular characters like Krillin, Yamcha, and others. The gameplay is pretty much the same as in the first game. Locations are composed of squares, and you move through them in a board-game-like fashion, drawing cards that will determine the amount of moves you can make. Random cards will also make you participate in battles, heal your party, add extra cards, etc. In battles you also depend on cards - your choice determines the strength of the move and the outcome of the automatic battle.</p>",

Son Goku's friend Krillin is found dead after a fighting tournament. A demon's symbol is engraved on a note left near the body. Master Roshi says that an evil demon named Piccolo Daimaou appeared on the Earth again. It is up to Son Goku to find Piccolo and to revive his friend.</p>\n<p>The game introduces the <em>card RPG</em> concept that was later used in Dragon Ball Z RPG series. All your movements in the game depend on your choices of cards that are shown at the bottom of the screen. You move around by choosing cards with appropriate numbers and talking steps on a line of squares. In battles, you choose offensive and defensive cards that will determine the outcome of the fight. You can train with the Master, visit various locations and explore the environments in \"Japanese adventure\"-fashion.</p>",

Carl moves through maze-like dungeons, finds keys, and then gets to the exit. After that, the dungeon disappears and makes it possible for the player to advance to the next one. Carl fights enemies with a bow; there is a limited supply of arrows, but it is possible to find quivers among other items in the dungeons.</p>",

As in the former, instead of the usual turn-based combat you fight your enemies in real time, parrying to avoid their blows and attacking physically or casting offensive magic to hurt them. As in the latter, you explore large outdoor areas, towns, and dungeons. </p>\n<p>You will specialize in five kinds of magic, but casting spells reduces your health points.

The game itself, however, features no story whatsoever, but a lot of platform action instead. You have to run quickly through the levels (there is a time limit), punching and kicking your enemies, causing them to fly away or to explode, occasionally meeting a boss, visiting secret areas behind doors and collecting various power-ups. </p>\n<p>There is also a VS. mode which lets the player fight against the first four stage bosses consecutively.</p>\n<p>This is in fact the second game in the series; the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/13412/hokuto-no-ken/\">first one</a> was never released outside of Japan.</p>",

He decides to investigate the matter and starts a dangerous journey, during which he teams up with some of the characters from the anim\u00e9 series.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is pretty similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dragon+Quest\"> Dragon Quest</a>: you interact with things and people by choosing commands from a menu, wander around the world map and fight random enemies from first-person perspective.

        "description": "<p>This is a sequel to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Goemon+Ougon\"> first</a> Ganbare Goemon Gaiden (side-story) RPG. Goemon, a cunning thief and an avid treasure hunting, has nothing to do and sits in his house, bored. But his trusty friend Ebisumaru has good news: there is a big treasure to find somewhere in a big city across the sea. Of course the treasure won't be just given to Goemon: he'll have to perform a dangerous mission before. The two friends board a ship and thus the journey begins...</p>\n<p>The game is very similar to its predecessor, as well as to most other console-style RPGs of the period. You talk to people in towns, buy various equipment, descend into dungeons, and fight random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat. The combat perspective is slightly changed in this sequel (over-the-shoulder view of the battle instead of semi-animated pictures).</p>",

        "description": "<p>In this second installment of \"Greek mythology\" RPG series, the main hero is not the legendary hero Herakles (Hercules), but a young boy from a town Nana, where he lives with his grandmother. The queen tells you that people are being tortured by Titans - an ancient god-like race controlled by the Lord of darkness. You must help to liberate people from the wrath of the Titans. Your first assignment is to go to Athens and to find the famous poet Homer who can tell you about the way to defeat the Titans. During your journey you meet many characters from the Greek mythology, including Daedalus, Cerberus, and Hephaestus, and recruit interesting creatures to fight at your side, such as the half-horse Centaur or the Woman Without Soul. You'll also encounter real people from the Greek history, like Homer the poet or Hippocrates the doctor.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dragon+Warrior\"> Dragon Warrior</a> style: you travel on the world map, visiting towns and dungeons, talking to people, and fighting random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. An interesting innovation is a full day/night cycle. Locations look different at night, and it is sometimes necessary to visit them at different times.</p>",

One day the queen tells you an evil demon is preparing to conquer the land of Villgust and to being death and destruction to all people. You are the only one who can save the world, but you need to be strong and to find comrades, such as cat-like fighters from a nearby town, to help you on your difficult quest. </p>\n<p>The game is a mixture of traditional RPG with side-scrolling action. Every time you encounter an enemy, you have two options: combat and auto-combat. Auto-combat makes you and the enemies attack in turn-based style, without you being able to interfere. If you choose the combat option, a side-view screen pops out, on which you and your enemies appear. Both your party and the foes can jump and attack in close combat and from a distance.</p>",

The white lion ran away and found a shelter in a dark cave near the town. Some years later, Maria's parents organize an expedition to the cave in order to find out what the white lion really is. But they never come back...</p>\n<p>Now Maria has to go to the cave and to search for her parents. Equipped with the famous spear the brave soldier Moja used to defeat the lion, she receives the village elder's permission to descend into the cave. But while wandering through the dark corridors, she falls into a river, and a strong current brings her to the Dream World. She no longer can return back, and the fairies who inhabit the Dream World tell her that the only way to defeat the lion is to travel to yet another world - the Dark World...</p>\n<p>In this game, you control Maria as she travels on the world maps, visits towns, and descends into dungeons. The battles are turn-based and are viewed from first-person perspective in Dragon Warrior style. Instead of party members you have ghosts you can summon to help you in battles, such as the soldier Moja and others. Hit points and magic points are called Courage and Dream, respectively. You gain levels only by finding special items, not from fighting random monsters.</p>",

He is the son of the famous swordsman Miyamoto Musashi and a skilled fighter himself. One day he hears of a rumor that the evil wizard Kojiro, his father's archenemy, has apparently reared up his ugly head once again! Kojiro's demons invade the land, and threaten death and destruction. \"I shall defeat Kojiro!\" - says Musashi, - \"and maybe even get laid\"...</p>\n<p><em>Musashi no B\u014dken</em> can be described as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dragon+Warrior\">Dragon Warrior</a> set in feudal Japan, as apart from the distinct classical Japanese flavor demonstrated here, the games are very similar. Musashi travels over the world map, visits towns, buys weapons and armor, descends into dungeons, and fights enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a first-person perspective.</p>",

In the fictional kingdom Littleland, the evil Zrool conspired against the royal family. He killed the king and the queen and usurped the throne, initiating a dark era of tyranny. But one of the king's guards, Radley, took the young heir of the throne and brought him securely to Damascus, where he grows up. Realizing he is the true prince of the Littleland dynasty, the young hero follows Radley's instructions and sets on a quest to find seven magical rainbow pieces, which alone will be able to destroy Zrool.</p>\n<p><em>Niji no Silkroad</em> is a Japanese-style RPG with first-person perspective, turn-based combat, and some less usual gameplay elements. You get neither experience points nor money from random enemies. Instead, by fighting a lot your popularity increases, and you are able to trade items by buying them in one town and selling in another. Trading is the only effective way of getting money in the game. You become stronger by buying and equipping better weapons and armor. Also, there is a thirst factor in the game. You have to drink water regularly, or else you'll be dried to death.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The game is based on the anime series <em>Saint Seiya</em> and follows the adventures of its main hero who bears the same name, although he is also known as the Bronze Saint Pegasus. Set in a modern world, and nevertheless being based on Greek mythology with some other influences (such as Scandinavian mythology), the anim\u00e9 and the game tell about three rivaling group of warriors (Saints): Bronze Saints, Silver Saints, and Gold Saints. The Gold Saints are the most powerful ones, but the hero Seiya is a Bronze Saint, and fights together with his comrades to protect the goddess Athena. Your first quest as Seiya will be to obtain the magic Pegasus Cloth and to bring your friends to a tournament before your rivals steel the valuable Sagittarius Cloth.</p>\n<p><em>Saint Seiya: \u014cgon Densetsu</em> is a mixture of side-scrolling action, fighting, and RPG. You travel through side-view levels, sometimes facing enemies and fighting them arcade style, jumping and punching. Boss battles are turn-based, but resemble fighting game battles: you have punching and kicking moves, and have to spend your special energy, called \"cosmo\", to perform them. When the enemy attack, you can choose between defending and avoiding the blows (which, naturally, doesn't always work).</p>",

The anim\u00e9 (and the game) tells the story of the noble Bronze Saints who have to save the goddess Athena, the only benevolent deity among the rivaling Greek gods. In the game, you control four Bronze Saints: Pegasus Seiya, Cygnus Hyoga, Dragon Shiryu, and Andromedus Shun. At specific parts of the game, you'll have to choose a specific character in order to trigger a story-related event. </p>\n<p>The gameplay is split into side-scrolling action and RPG-like turn-based fights. During the side-view sequences you travel through short levels, beating up goons who are trying to stop you, jumping and trying not to fall into the abyss. You accumulate experience points, called \"Seven Senses\", which you can then distribute to raise your HP or Cosmo Power. Cosmo is a kind of energy you need to perform an attack, and it decreases the more you fight. In the end of a level, a boss usually awaits you, whom you fight in turn-based style, performing punches and kicks.</p>",

You are told to defeat Geyla and to free the Fairy Land. But you are unsure about your motivation.

You have a special meter called Toku that will indicate exactly how much you are interested in saving the world, and how much in grabbing treasures. Your actions will influence the outcome of the story.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is predominantly side-scrolling action.

The famous painter Mamiya Ichirou lived many years in a secluded mansion, and rumor says there are some valuable frescos to find inside. Our investigators decide to take some pictures of the frescos. However, upon entering the mansion, a ghost-like figure of Mamiya appears and threatens them. After this, they find themselves trapped in the mansion. The heroes must now find a way out of the mansion, not forgetting the frescos they came there for, and the destiny of an earlier investigation group that has disappeared under mysterious circumstances.</p>\n<p>The game mixes role-playing with survival horror elements. The basic structure is that of a Japanese-style RPG: characters fight random monsters in turn-based battles, equip various weapons and level up. The player must form different teams from the five available characters, both for battles and for solving puzzles. Each character has his (or her) own item-based skill: Taro can take pictures, Emi can unlock almost any door, Kazuo has a lighter, Akiko uses a vacuum cleaner to remove dust and other obstacles, and Asuka has medical kits.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the anim\u00e9 series <em>Ushio &amp; Tora</em>, this game tells the story of a boy named Ushio. He lives in a modern-day Tokyo with his father, but his family line stretches back to the samurai days of Japan. Five hundred years ago a demon was terrorizing the land. Ushio's ancestor, wielding a magical spear from China, managed to bind the monster to a rock with an artifact. Unable to kill the demon, he built a temple around it and stayed there as a monk in order to make sure it won't escape. Ushio finds the demon still tied to the rock in the basement of one of the temple buildings. Unfortunately, by breaking the seal on the doors to the basement, Ushio has released the demon's evil energy, which attracts other monsters. Ushio calls the demon Tora, because it reminds him of a tiger (<em>Tora</em> is Japanese for <em>tiger</em>). Tora has to stick with Ushio, because he holds the magical spear, and to help him to defeat his own evil will!</p>\n<p>The game plays like a traditional Japanese-style RPG, with turn-based battles, where Ushio uses his family magic, and Tora his demonic abilities. You explore Tokyo by moving Ushio around from top-down perspective, and inside houses and dungeons the view switches to first-person, like in early \"interactive fiction\" adventures.</p>",

One day, before going to sleep, they notice a strange creature outside: it looks like a pink-white cat (<em>Final Fantasy</em> fans would immediately say: a <em>moogle</em>!), but talks like a human being. Before the mysterious creature disappears, it says only a short sentence: \"Children! Find the <em>Time Crown</em>!\". Without understanding what he meant by this, but realizing it must be something important, the two young heroes embark the next day on a dangerous journey - the quest for the power of the crown!</p>\n<p>\"Erika &amp; Satoru\" plays like a traditional Japanese adventure, although you can also move on the overworld, visiting locations by standing on them and pressing the A button. Upon visiting a location, you can interact with characters and objects you view from first-person perspective by selecting icons located in the corner of the screen: talk to characters, examine, manipulate items, etc. The unusual part is that you control <em>two</em> characters: you can (and should) switch between them and sometimes work together in order to fulfil your quest. There is also a two-players mode, where Erika and Satoru cooperate while being controlled each one by a different player.</p>",

Once upon a time, an old man went to the forest to cut some bamboo, and found a little baby girl. He took her to his house and named her Kaguya-hime. She grew up there, and soon became the most beautiful girl of Japan. Many young men, including the son of the emperor himself, tried to conquer her heart, but for no avail. One day Kaguya-hime confessed she was a moon angel, and returned back to the moon. In this game, you control the son of the emperor, and you'll do your best to reach Kaguya-hime and to protect her. You must overcome various obstacles and meet characters from Japanese folklore.</p>\n<p>The game is a traditional Japanese adventure: all the actions are performed by selecting commands from the menu, including moving from location to location. You view the locations from first-person perspective, but there are also parts where you navigate your character from a  top-down view. Beside the usual adventure commands such as \"look\", \"take\", or \"use\" (an inventory item) there are some more original actions available under \"extras\", such as \"kiss\", \"attack\", and even \"undress\".</p>",

        "description": "<p>The game is set in Congo, Africa, in 1870, and its main character is a historical figure. You play as Henry M. Stanley (1841-1904), a reporter for the New York City Newspaper, who was sent by his employers to chronicle the work of the famous Africa-explorer, Dr. Livingston. Unfortunately, the Doctor left without you, hating press and everything connected to it. Recently he disappeared somewhere in the jungle of Congo, leaving only a few notes. Apparently, he was on the trail of\nre-discovering the legendary lost temple of the Amut people, Am-Zutuk. You decide to follow his steps, to find the lost Dr. Livingston, and maybe to learn more about the mysterious people of Amut and the temple.</p>\n<p>The game takes you to Congo, where you can move from location to location on a \"world map\" with about a hundred accessible areas. You should make your way through platform levels populated with wild animals and other foes. Some of the levels are impassable or serve no purpose, others contain valuable clues and useful items. You can also visit town areas and talk to people. There is a variety of weapons to be found during your quest, including \"native\" ones such as blowpipe and spear.</p>",

Apparently, grandfather also knew who or what this figure was, since he called him by the name <em>Rosenkreuz</em>. Rosenkreuz explains that he has waited a hundred years, but now it is possible to bring back the God of Evil, and to control the world! But for an unknown reason, he needs Miu. Rosenkreuz strikes your grandfather, and kidnaps Miu! Before grandfather dies, he could only whisper: \"Save... Miu...\".

You control Kaneda, the leader of one of such guys, and the main character in the movie. Kaneda's childhood friend, Tetsuo, is injured during the highway chase, and taken by the military.

In many situations, some options will lead to Kaneda's death or imprisonment, which is Game Over. There are no real puzzles or anything of the sort, but if you choose the \"examine\" option which is available on most screens, you can move the cursor around the screen and choose what exactly you want to examine.</p>",

Using your Power Glove, you have to entirely break down a wall before being allowed to advance to the next room. </p>\n<p>While trying to progress through the maze, your character will be under attack by a range of creatures, and a wizard who wants to mess with your work. The object for the player is to find the way out of the maze and rescue the Commander.</p>",

It is not clear how it fits in the series' timeline, but it starts with Jennifer mourning over Rick's grave (her boyfriend). Lightning strikes his grave and he is resurrected. Before she can rejoice, another bolt strikes the grave next to him and a jack-o-lantern appears. This pumpkin king kidnaps Jennifer and Rick barely has the time to wipe off the dust from his clothes before he sets off to rescue his girlfriend.</p>\n<p>Although the game is not as gory as the other titles, there is still plenty of disturbing enemies such as headless chickens, severed hands and zombies. Through seven side-scrolling levels, including a graveyard, a mansion, a Japanese pagoda and an Egyptian pyramid, you chase the pumpkin king with your cleaver and a shotgun you can pick up along the road. Just like the other games in the series, there are lots of movie references. The game often needs good timing and pixel perfect jumps, as falling down from platforms will regenerate the enemies. You can pick up candy, hamburgers and cans of soda to restore your health.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Loosely based on the fourth movie \"Jaws: the Revenge\", players take control of a ship to sail the ocean in the search for the killer shark.  Along the way, the ship will stop to allow a diver to swim out and kill baby sharks, jellyfish and manta rays to find conch shells.  The conch shells are used to buy upgrades for the boat.  Extra conch shells can be earned in bonus rounds where a sea plane flies over the water to bomb jellyfish (think the bonus rounds of Galaga with reversed perspective).</p>\n<p>The diver will battle Jaws several times in an attempt to wear down his life meter.  If the player is lucky, they can find a submarine to increase their firepower and defense.</p>\n<p>If the diver manages to wear down Jaws' energy, they take back to the boat again, launching strobes into the water in an attempt to lure the shark out of the water.  If close enough, the player can use the boat to ram Jaws in an attempt to kill him and win the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Conflict is a turn-based, hex-grid wargame for the NES that can be played by one or two players.  It is not a strictly historical wargame in which battles of the past are recreated using real-world geography.  Instead, the two opposing sides (Blue vs. Red) fight it out across 16 imaginary scenarios with armies modeled on NATO and Warsaw Pact forces of the late 1980s. </p>\n<p>The game alternates between two modes of play: a strategic/operational scale, in which players move their units around the hex map; and a tactical combat module for resolving unit-to-unit combats.  In the tactical mode, human players have the choice of either issuing orders themselves or using the \"auto\" mode which delegates command to the AI.\nSplash graphics and text messages convey battle results.</p>\n<p>By capturing towns and winning battles, the player gains \"fame\" points that can be used to purchase more and better military hardware.  Every scenario ends only when the same, single victory condition is achieved by one of the two sides: destroy the opposing side's main battle tank unit in combat.</p>\n<p>Winning any one of the first 15 scenarios yields a letter of the alphabet; together, the letters spell out the password that must be entered in order to play the final scenario.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A simple, top-down driving game where you play a patrol officer in a city police force. You progressively take down bigger bad guys by chasing them down and shooting at them. The gameplay is a precursor to the first <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/417/grand-theft-auto/\">Grand Theft Auto</a> games, developed later.</p>\n<p>Gameplay consists of driving your squad car around the city, pulling over speeders, by flashing the siren, and stopping random robberies, by shooting the getaway car. Larger crimes will pop up, which lead to capturing whoever the current Public Enemy No. 1 is. The game ends when you fail in a mission, or when you total your police cruiser.</p>",

This war machine has been named the Red October. While on its trial run, the captain, Marko Ramius has hijacked the submarine along with it's crew. They plan to defect to the United States. Naturally, such a weapon must not be allowed to fall into American plans, and so orders are issued among the Soviet forces to destroy the Red October. </p>\n<p>You control the Red October during its run for freedom. The game plays as an underwater sidescroller. The Red October submarine can move in any of four directions. The A button fires torpedoes horizontally towards the right and the B button fires missiles vertically, upwards. Additionally, the Caterpillar drive (invisibility) may be activated for short periods of time. The player may also activate a ECM blast that will destroy all nearby offensive weapons. On the screen at all times are displays for Armor (health) and Power (fuel); should either run low, the Red October in danger of being destroyed. Power-Ups to increase or decrease the power of missiles and torpedoes may be found by destroying enemies.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Long ago the Crystal Palace was a thriving kingdom, however the evil war spirit Zaras appeared one day and brought destruction to the lands! The people of the Crystal Palace left as Zaras and his henchman took over, changing the kingdom into a maze of many dangers. You control Farron, the hero of the story who needs to enter the Crystal Palace and destroy the bad guys in order to restore peace. The game is an action platform game that scrolls both horizontally and vertically. On each of five stages you'll need to fight various enemies throughout the varied terrain, and finally defeat the boss at the end. You'll start with just a simple sword, but additional weapons can be found or bought in order to help you out. If you get into trouble, you can also call your dog Zap onto the screen; he'll jump around causing damage to the enemies giving you a chance to escape. You may also come across Kim's shops along your journey. Here you can buy various items, including additional  lives, replenish your health, more powerful weapons, and other useful items. To purchase items, you'll need money which can be collected after defeating enemies in battle.</p>",

While the Enterprise is investigating strange gravitational disturbances, it is drawn into a dimensional hole and ends up in unknown space with broken warp engines. Now, Captain Kirk and his crew must try to repair the ship and find a way home.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is divided into two parts, taking place on the ship's bridge and away missions. On the bridge, you can communicate with other ships, call up a map to navigate the ship (once the warp engines are fixed), enter battle mode to fight other ships (which does not happen very often), save the game or beam down to a planet's surface.  </p>\n<p>These away missions make up the major part of the game and play very much like other action adventures. You can talk to aliens find and use objects, solve puzzles and fight against hostile lifeforms. Battles with other ships or on away missions are handled in simple Shoot'em Up-fashion.</p>",

The game can be played against computer AI or human opponents (up to three). It is a board game in which the players' trains are positioned on the map of Japan, divided into sections with circles that determine the amount of moves. The latter is decided by a roll of a dice. There are special circles which take you to various locations in typically Japanese style, where you can gain some bonuses before you proceed with the \"train competition\".</p>",

However, Malkil did not perish, and has now taken the shape of the four elements: water, wind, air and fire. Kuros is summoned to the land of Sindarin to destroy Malkil again. In order to accomplish that, he will have to collect the shattered pieces of the legendary Ironsword with the help of the four animal kings, and defeat the elementals who protect Malkil's essence.</p>\n<p>Like its predecessor, <em>Ironsword: Wizards &amp; Warriors II</em> is a side-scrolling action game with platform elements. Kuros uses swords and spells to fight the enemies in his path. He can also jump and crouch, which is often necessary to move through a stage and avoid taking damage. The game world consists of four domains; in each of those, Kuros must find a golden artifact and bring it back to the animal king residing there. This opens the path to the elemental boss guarding the domain, which must be defeated with spells.</p>\n<p>Magic spells can be bought in special locations or found during exploration. They have a variety of functions, e.g. turning enemies into money or food, slowing down enemies, granting Kuros temporary invincibility, or creating fountains that help him reach high areas. Some of these spells disappear after one use, while others consume magic points. Weapon and armor upgrades can also be bought in shops. Kuros can restore his health by eating; food is either scattered throughout the stages or offered at inns.</p>",

        "description": "<p>John McClain decides to visit his wife Holly in Nakatomi Plaza, only to discover that she is taken hostage on the 30th floor, along with a bunch of other hostages. The main terrorist, Hans, is after the money locked away in a safe on the 30th floor. His hacker, Theo, is slowly breaking the locks into the vault. It's up to McClain to stop them. <em>Die Hard</em> for the Nintendo Entertainment System is very different from its other counterparts. The game is played from a top-down perspective, rather than the 1st-/3rd-person perspective.</p>\n<p>There are 40 terrorists scattered throughout the building, and the task is to clear each floor of terrorists. The stairwell, air duct or the express elevator is used to travel only to Floors 31-35. These are freely accessible at any time, doing away with linearity, and more floors are unlocked in \"Advanced\" mode. At the start of the game, John can only use his fists to deal with foes, but after bringing down some terrorists, several weapons become available, including the pistol, machine gun, C-4 explosives, rocket launcher, and flashbangs, using their weapons against them. When hit by these terrorists, John loses some life, but it can be restored by collecting soda cans and medkits. The game ends when all life is lost. </p>\n<p>One interesting aspect of the game allows the player to listen to Hans shouting orders to his guards through a two-way radio. Also notable is the \"foot meter\". It starts out full, but will eventually decrease if John steps on shattered glass or runs around at a faster speed. If the meter is empty, he will walk much slower than with a full meter. This may have been added in tune with the film, where the main character John McClain's feet end up in pretty bad shape near the end. Parts of the environments are destructible, most notably vending machines (receive free soda), glass walls and windows. Not all parts of the environment are shown on the screen all the time - a fog of war appears to shroud nearby areas in darkness.</p>\n<p>The missions are time limited. There about four minutes before one of the six locks are opened (shown in the status screen), but more time can be gained by destroying the main computer on the fourth level.

When they steal a spaceship and start to expand their wars across the solar systems, you are trained by the elders to halt their dominance and destroy the home planet with a secret weapon known as \"Thunderbolt\".</p>\n<p>Using the typical thrust movement from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Asteroids\">Asteroids</a> games, you roam space with your starship to return the peace by force. Starting as a rookie, many enemy ships need to be destroyed to earn credits that can be exchanged for fuel, armor, weapons, shields and warp drives. The commander instructs you with specific missions, such as destroying outposts or freeing alien groups. However, your ultimate goal is to find the Toson Drive, the only device powerful enough to reach P'radikus. To spice things up, there are many weapons such as shock waves, mines, missiles, cloaking devices and atomic cannons. As your fuel constantly depletes, you often need to orbit new planets to refuel and stock weapons.</p>",

With his trusty hammer, Kernel needs to clear the levels by slamming all loose bugs. You will be haunted by spiders, ants, fireflies, worms, sharks, jellyfish and mutants.</p>\n<p>The nine levels are pretty straightforward side-scrolling platform stages, with a nice twist in level 5, 7 and 8.1 (a helicopter, underwater and moon surface level respectively). While playing, you can view a status report with the remaining bugs to be found. Some defeated enemies leave behind hearts (extra lives) and the final level introduces an adventure element when you have to find a key card to open the door to Ronnie's lair.</p>",

It's up to you to stop them!  Strap on your jet pack, and get ready to become the ultimate Burai Fighter.</p>\n<p>Burai Fighter is an arcade shooter with two modes of play.  Most levels are side- and vertical-scrolling with pre-designed layouts.  A few levels are different, though: top-down perspective, with a randomized layout.  Either way, you'll be armed with a variety of weapons, including different guns (laser, missile, ring) and the powerful cobalt bomb which kills everything onscreen.</p>\n<p>Burai Fighter uses a slightly different gameplay mechanic when compared to other shooters. You can shoot in 8 directions, and when you hold down the fire button you keep shooting in that direction.</p>",

The people lived in harmony with one another and with their surroundings, thanks to the benevolent influence of the native wizards and their magical arts. All was calm until one ambitious wizard named Abadon began to lust for power. Abadon overwhelmed the other wizards, brought evil upon the land, and made himself its master. Only Paul, a young magician's apprentice, was left to oppose him. Can you guide Paul to victory, or will Abadon rule Merlwood forever?</p>\n<p><em>Magician</em> is a 2D, side-scrolling action RPG. As Paul, you must travel through towns, have conversations with non-player characters, acquire and manage inventory (food, water, weapons, potions, etc.), learn magic spells, fight battles, and solve puzzles. Your ultimate goal: collect each of the four elemental vials -- earth, air, fire, and water -- and combine them to create the Ultimate Potion. Only then can you hope to vanquish the evil wizard Abadon!</p>",

However, NFL is also a very strategic, coaching-oriented take on the sport, featuring large playbooks (team plays are included on a separate fold-out sheet bundled with the game manual, but not onscreen in the game itself), limited customization of team skills, and penalties.</p>",

There is no challenge in the game: the only thing you have to do is to provide information about yourself (like when you were born, in which place you grew up, etc.). Then you enter the current date. After this, you can access a large menu, where you can learn various things about yourself by talking to Ai Sensei. Those things include general horoscope, your destiny depending on the planets, your future love life, etc. The explanations can be quite detailed and are often accompanied by pictures, which vary depending on the character you have created.</p>",

You play a young detective who investigates a strange case: eight people have disappeared, and rumors are heard about a mysterious Ghost Train. You head to a remote village to learn more about those events. In this adventure game, you can move your hero from third-person perspective, but you can leave a screen only via a menu command. The menu is unique to each location; in some of them, you'll be able to investigate a room by moving around a cursor and clicking on objects, while in others you'll talk to people about various topics.</p>",

Will Armadillo be able to rescue the girl and to defeat his enemies?</p>\n<p>In this game, you move Armadillo around an area map composed of squares. Some of them are empty, while others represent locations. Once you enter a location, you find yourself on a platform level, that often contains several sub-levels. There are sometimes branching ways on the area map, and you are not obliged to access all the locations to clear an area. On the platform levels, Armadillo can either walk and jump in his normal form (dies from single enemy hit), or turn into a ball, which is invulnerable to enemies' attacks, but is hard to control: the ball follows realistic physics, bounces of walls, and takes time to stop rolling. During the game, Armadillo will also be able to find upgrades that will allow him to take an animal's form for a short time.</p>",

This determines the personality and the abilities of your characters (their intelligence level, physical condition, etc.). You then guide your teenager characters through a series of typical events. For example, at the beginning you'll be in school and will have to solve simple mathematical exercises. After that, you are presented with a calendar, which is your board in the game. You cannot control the actions of the characters, but depending on the way you have created them, and on the day the game will randomly choose for you, events will occur in their life, some of which are completely ordinary (like going out and meeting someone), while others will grant your characters more intelligence, physical condition, or let them earn or spend money. The game will also determine what personal relationship the characters will have with each other, and whether a romantic involvement is possible.</p>",

A roll of dice determines how many moves the character will make. Depending on the circle the character steps on, different things will occur. Random circles will take you to a journey or depict a simple day spent with your family. Others will add money to the character, or make him train and raise his physical condition, etc. The characters move over the entire board, living their lives, visiting school, meeting with each other, etc.</p>",

        "description": "<p>\"Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou 2\" is a board game, during which you follow the lives of up to 4 characters. The game is best played as multiplayer, but you can also allow the computer to play for other characters, or create all of them on your own. In the game, you are presented with a board which is composed of tiles. A roll of dice determines the amount of steps a character will take on the board. Depending on the tile he steps on, different events will occur. If the tile is empty, a random event will happen. Other tiles are connected to a certain aspect of a person's life. For example, \"learning\" tiles will trigger an event that will make the character more intelligent (like studying for the school), and a tile with a \"love\" icon will lead to a romantic encounter and raise the love level of the character.</p>",

You can create all the characters on your own, let the computer AI handle them, or play with other players. You move your character(s) through the game world (it doesn't look like a board, like in the first two games, but still works the same way). The amount of steps is determined randomly: a spinning indicator will eventually stop on one of the numbers, from 1 to 6, similar to a dice roll. Unlike the first two games, there are no special icons on the board, all you see is a usual neighborhood with houses, streets, etc. Random events will happen to your characters during their life. Most of those events will modify your character's parameters. For example, a school event will increase their knowledge, sports will raise their physical condition, etc. You'll earn or lose money depending on the event. Your characters will also meet up with each other, fall in love, and experience other events, good or bad.</p>",

        "description": "<p>It's the year 2777. Due to nuclear wars and natural disasters, Earth's population has decreased dramatically and only five island are left, forming the nation of Xexyz. In Xexyz, humans, spirits and faeries have lived peacefully for centuries under the reign of King Xeu Star. One day, Xexyz is attacked by Goruza who murders the king, builds mechanical castles on each island and captures the queen of each island. You take on the role of a soldier named Apollo who wants to put an end to Goruza's reign.</p>\n<p>Controlling Apollo, it is your task to free all five islands. Freeing an island is done in several different phases that feature 'Jump'n Shoot' as well as 'Shooter' levels (called \"Action Mode\" and \"Shooting Mode\"). The first level of each island is a Jump'n Shoot level that contains many doors to shops, bonus games, friendly NPCs or mid-bosses. NPCs will sometimes give you important hints, items or weapons; bonus games can be played to win some money (\"Balls\"); defeating mid-bosses (and thereby freeing a Fairy) will get you a cash reward and shops also offer weapons and items. Weapons differ largely in attack power and range. Items have temporary effects such as invincibility or improved jumping abilities. In an island's first level, you will have to find a secret room and defeat a boss, for which you will receive a Force Star that is needed to gain access to a mechanical castle. Mechanical castles look similar to other Jump'n Shoot levels but are more complex.</p>\n<p>Once you have made your way to a \"Cyborg Rider\", a self-scrolling Shooter sequence starts in which you have to shoot your way through lots of enemies while picking up speed and weapon power-ups.\nAt the end of this sequence you will leave the Cyborg Rider, and step onto a floating platform for a boss fight. After the boss is defeated, another Shooter sequence with another boss at the end awaits, but this time, the boss if fought from the Cyborg Rider. After defeating this boss, you start the process over with a Jump'n Shoot level. </p>",

Three races - Angels, Demons, and Talismans - co-existed in the world, protected by the Holy Goddess Nadia. One day, Nadia sent her twin children into the world. Jura, the head of the Demons, abducted one of the children and devoured it. The other child took refuge by the Angels and soon became their leader, known as Super Zeus. He led the Angels to a victory over the Demons. But Nadia, seeing how her world is being torn apart by the war, split it in two. Years have passed. You are a young hero named Yamato Ouji, raised in the world of the Angels. Super Zeus sends you on a quest to find other Holy Warriors, to re-unite the worlds, and to bring everlasting peace to all the races.</p>\n<p>This is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. You navigate your hero from a top-down view on the world map, in towns, and dungeons. The enemies are random and the combat is turn-based, viewed from first-person perspective. You start alone but later you find other heroes who join your party and help you on your quest.</p>",

        "description": "<p>\"Mermaids of Atlantis\" is basically a non-adult version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/17927/bubble-bath-babes/\"> Bubble Bath Babes</a>. Only instead of a naked girl there is a mermaid who is wearing a bra. This mermaid lies on the bottom of the play field and sends colored bubbles into the air. What you must do is arrange the bubbles in such a way that they build a row of 4 or more of the same color. The game uses the same graphics (except the mermaid) and gameplay mechanics as the original, adding three difficulty settings, the possibility to begin from any stage, and a background story: the evil underwater emperor O-Dinten has sealed all the games (yes, that's right!) into bubbles, and you must complete the game to unlock them and to bring entertainment back to the sea people.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Mr. Gimmick is a little doll with a life of its own, that's given to a girl for her birthday. The girl's other toys quickly become jealous of the attention given to Mr. Gimmick, and they decide to carry her away to a mystical land. Mr. Gimmick goes after them to bring his owner back. </p>\n<p>The game Mr. Gimmick is a platform game where you take control of Mr. Gimmick over the course of six levels. You defend yourself by throwing bouncing stars that take a second to form and are then thrown downward. You can also ride the stars thrown to gain access to higher platforms. The inventory you have allows you to store bombs, potions, and fireballs.</p>\n<p>The game has two endings. The easier way is to just run through all of the levels. Each level has a treasure hidden that can be a bit difficult to get, and finding all of these gives access to an extra level. But if you lose all of your lives and have to continue, the game will take all of your treasures away, and not allow you to get to the final level.</p>",

        "description": "<p>One of Mickey's friends is in trouble, and Mickey and Minnie Mouse are on a rescue mission! <em>Mickey Mousecapade</em> is an action platform game. In order to reach your goal (and find out which of Mickey's friends is in trouble), you'll need to jump and climb your way through various levels which take place in different locations (including a fun house, a treacherous sea side, a pirate ship, and a castle). Each screen has numerous obstacles and enemies which will drain your energy if you come in contact; lose all of your energy, and a life is lost and the game ends when you have no lives left. You control Mickey Mouse and Minnie follows along. You'll need to make sure Minnie stays safe as you make your way through the levels (for example, if you mistime a jump and Mickey lands safely but Minnie doesn't a life will be lost). In addition to avoiding obstacles, there is also some occasional puzzle solving (such as locating a key to open locked doors, or finding your way out of the woods).</p>\n<p>There are some differences between the US and Japanese versions of this game. Most enemies are different in each version, specially the bosses. While the Japanese version has most of its bosses based on Alice in Wonderland (the Cheshire Cat in stage one, the Dodo in stage two, the Caterpillar in stage three and the Queen of Heats in stage five), the US version has enemies from several other Disney movies. Captain Hook from Peter Pan appears in the Japanese version as the boss for the fourth level, while in the US version he's replaced by Peg-Leg Pete. The other bosses in the US version are Witch Hazel (stage one), the Crocodile from Peter Pan (stage two), Kaa from The Jungle Book (stage three) and Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty (stage five). There is also a gameplay difference: in the Japanese version Mickey sometimes finds hidden keys which lead him and Minnie to a secret room. In that room, he must pick 4 fairies in the right order; doing so, he earns an 1-Up.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Super Team Games</em> is a side scrolling game where two players compete in races on an obstacle course. The game utilizes the Nintendo Power Pad; to control your on screen character you will need to run in place on the Power Pad to make your character run, and actually jump to make him jump. In the basic game you need to run and jump your way to the finish line as fast as possible. Some additional game variations are available, such as the belly bump ball (you need to roll a giant ball through the obstacle course by running into it), the crab walk (make it to the finish line walking like a crab!), the water cross (water is found on the track; if you mistime your jump and land in the water you need to swim to get out costing you valuable time), the bubble run (racing through the course inside a giant bubble), or the skateboard race. Several cooperative games are included as well, including a tug of war, relay race, and six legged race.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>T&amp;C Surf Designs</em> features both skateboarding and surfing games. The skating section (called Street Skate Session) is a side scrolling action game where you need to navigate through an obstacle course within the given time limit. Ideally you want to earn as many points as possible by performing tricks, jumping over items, and collecting bonuses. If you crash too many times (or fall into a hole, run out of time, etc...) then the game will be over. In the surfing section (called Big Wave Encounter) you need to surf a giant wave all the way to the beach. As with skating, you can earn points by performing tricks and collecting bonuses; likewise the game ends if you crash too many times. You can choose to play either game individually, or alternate between the two (the Wood &amp; Water Rage option). You can select several T&amp;C Surf Designs characters to play as, including Thrilla Gorilla, Kool Kat, Joe Cool, and Tiki Man.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Silver Surfer roams throughout space as herald to Galactus, looking for new planets for him to feed on. However his mission is interrupted by a summon from Galactus. Silver Surfer learns that creatures from the Magick Dimension are trying to break through into the universe and their coming will end all life. Vowing to stop them, Silver Surfer must assemble the pieces of a mysterious Cosmic Device and use it to push them back. The pieces of the Device are currently in the hands of some malicious creatures: Reptyl, Mephisto, Skrull Emperor, Possessor and Firelord. Silver Surfer must travel to their domains and defeat them in order to obtain pieces of the device.</p>\n<p>Silver Surfer is a shooter game, with some levels taking place vertically and some horizontally. The Surfer's only ability is to move around on the screen and to shoot directly in front of him. Power-ups that can be picked up include: the letter \"F\" (Firepower) which will increase the number and power of his projectiles, Smart bombs which destroy everything on the screen, the letter \"S\" (Speedup) which increases the surfer's movement and Orbs which will also fire the Surfer's weapon. Orbs are special in that two can be obtained (only 1 is shown on horizontal scrolling levels) and they can be positioned to fire forwards, backwards or sideways.</p>",

When you beat the computer in the single player mode, you move on to a faster opponent. The AI opponents are (slowest to fastest): Turtle, Bear, Horse, Rabbit, Bobcat and Cheetah. With each defeated opponent, you earn a medal or a trophy - the harder the opponent, the better the award.</p>\n<p>Olympics is a 1-6 player event in which you will do all four events in a row.

Upon collecting the 50th coin, the \"finished the castle\" music will play and a score will be displayed.</p>\n<p>The second game played is Course 1 of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7765/rad-racer/\">Rad Racer</a>, using the 328 Twin Turbo vehicle. The player must finish the course as quickly as possible. No clock is shown in the game but the cartridge keeps track internally. After finishing Rad Racer, its score is displayed, multiplied by 10 and added to the previous Super Mario Bros. score.</p>\n<p>Last up is Nintendo's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tetris\">Tetris</a> in A-type mode. All remaining time for the Championship is played out here. The player's objective is simply to get the best score. The Tetris score is multiplied by 25 and added to the previous Super Mario Bros. and Rad Racer scores.</p>\n<p>After all the time runs out, a screen will display \"Time!\" and display the final score, a sum of the previous scores and their multipliers.</p>",

Only one hero, Captain Commando remains to defeat the alien armada by entering Balangool and fighting through the various sections until reaching Section-Z.</p>\n<p><em>Section-Z</em> is a side-scrolling shooter where the player must travel through the maze that is Balangool. Typically this consists of traveling through a scrolling corridor and reaching the end where a new direction must be chosen. Captain Commando's abilities are shooting directly left or directly right while moving around the screen. Power-ups can be collected by defeated enemies and include; improved lasers, a 3-way cannon and shield, these can be stored until needed. There are also SMS (Special Transmission Shell) power-ups, which require energy to use Energy units, are used to absorb enemy fire. Loss of all energy or running into an enemy or a wall causes death.</p>\n<p>Certain sections of Balangool are blocked until a generator can be found and destroyed.

The action isn't frantic, but the game is still somewhat difficult due to tight enemy attack waves and the possibility of being shot in the back. For this reason, you should not let enemies pass unscathed, since they may shoot back at you from off-screen. At some points, power up capsules will materialize in space. They will grant you not only greater firepower, but also serve as a reconfigurable armor, which is SDF's main selling point. The armor may be moved from your front to your back, and while it is moved in a large arc, it will destroy any enemies it happens to ram. When fastened to your rear, it will also grant a small speed boost. Learning to use the armor is the key to surviving in this game.</p>",

A division of the CIA builds itself a hi-tech helicopter in secrecy and codenames it \"AirWolf\". Armed with advanced weaponry, it is able to stand up to most types of enemy resistance. Given missions by intelligence agent Archangel, Airwolf is sent around to world on top-secret missions to quell trouble.</p>\n<p>Before each mission, the player is briefed and allowed to choose a primary and secondary weapon for Airwolf's firing buttons. From this, Airwolf then fires at enemies that appear on the screen and approaches a boss weapon. The game then switches to first-person, where the boss must be targeted in different locations.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</em> differs from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/21730/indiana-jones-and-the-last-crusade/\">the two other games with the same name</a> as it is a hybrid of various genres such as platform action, motorcycle racing, puzzle solving and even some adventure elements.</p>\n<p>In <em>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</em> you play Indy's role in his search for the Holy Grail, but this time it is you who chooses which step he will take at each part of his quest. For example, in the very beginning you receive a diary about the Grail from Indy's father, who is in Venice. At the same time, you receive a telegram from Marcus saying that the Cross of Coronado is in Portugal on a ship called Coronado, and that he'll meet Indy there. So you have to choose what you'll do first: go to Venice and check about the Grail and your father, or go to Portugal to find Marcus and the Cross of Coronado.</p>\n<p>In the entire game you'll be prompted with these choices, each one leading to different stages throughout the game. Each stage presents different game genres. For example, in Venice you find a scrambled picture of the Grail, and you have to try to put it back together, just like you'd do with the pieces of a puzzle. Besides, in the platform stages, Indy has plenty of movements, as he can punch, kick, walk, run, jump and use his whip.</p>\n<p>The game presents bitmapped pictures of the real movie actors, such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/25947/harrison-ford/\">Harrison Ford</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Sean+Connery\">Sean Connery</a>.</p>",

The boy had extraordinary talents for martial arts, and for that reason the god Tai Yi gave him three powerful artifacts. One day he went to swim in the sea and disturbed the prince of dragons. The prince became angry and went out of the water to fight Ne Zha. Unaware of the power of the artifacts, Ne Zha unintentionally killed the prince. The Dragon Lord could not China if Ne Zha stays alive. Ne Zha killed himself to protect his land, and Tai Yi, touched by his sacrifice, revived him and made him more powerful than ever before. Now Ne Zha is strong enough to find three other legendary warriors and to defeat the evil king Zhou, the last one of Shang-Yin dynasty, and to put a just ruler on the throne instead.</p>\n<p><em>Fengshenbang</em> is a traditional Asian-style RPG. Most of the game is spent fighting random enemies and gain experience points to level up. The turn-based combat is viewed mostly from first-person perspective, although you can see your characters on the screen when they are attacking. The simple battle system allows you to use physical attacks or cast magic. The interface of the game requires you to select actions from a menu, in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dragon+Quest\"> Dragon Quest</a> style.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Unlike its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/882/dragonstrike/\">namesake on computers</a>, this version of <em>DragonStrike</em> is a straight action game with a top-down perspective. Set during the War of the Lance in the <em>Dragonlance</em> world of Krynn, the player controls dragons in missions against the forces of evil.</p>\n<p>At the start of the game, one of three dragons can be selected (Bronze, Silver and Gold), each with different attributes in speed and armor and two different breath attacks. In each of the more than 12 missions, several objectives must be completed: enemy dragons must be hunted down, ships sunk and fortresses destroyed. The dragon can change between low and high altitudes to avoid obstacles and enemy fire and to attack certain types of enemies: ground troops can only be destroyed from the lower altitude, dragons only from the higher one. Killed enemy dragons leave power-ups that grant temporary protection, speed, or let the dragon regain health. Some of the missions include boss battles against large enemies like a giant kraken or a powerful dark wizard.</p>\n<p>In two-player mode, the second player (who can select a different dragon) can continue in the mission where the previous player failed.</p>",

However dangerous enemies lurk all over the battlefield. Helicopters, minefields and other tanks wait to block your moves. These enemies can move off-screen and strafe around the tank, leading to difficulties. </p>\n<p>However, many strategic elements are involved. The first-person mode offers a limited view of the battlefield, and if players push the tank into overdrive it can miss the target and rush into a nest of tanks or a minefield. Turret angle, ammunition, and tank fuel remaining must all be taken into account by the player. To add to this, certain guns on the tank (there's 4 of them) will only hurt certain enemies. But don't expect any help here! Six hits and your tank is cooked!</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Stealth ATF</em> is a flight simulator in which you pilot a F-117A, a.k.a. Nighthawk in several missions.</p>\n<p>In every mission's beginning and ending the player has to take off and land the plane respectively, from a side view. Failing to land after completing the target objectives means failing to succeed in mission and thus having to replay it.</p>\n<p>The view during the flight is from inside the cockpit, and the gameplay offers total freedom of movement on flight. The terrain is infinite, and the enemies will re-appear on the radar every time they fly out of range. The player flies in different locations, such as the Middle East, Alaska, the Pacific, etc. During flight, the player can also turn off the music and play with only the flight sounds.</p>\n<p>The mission is to defeat a fixed number of enemies each mission. The targets will always be aerial ones. The weapons available are a cannon (which ammunition is unlimited) and missiles (8 per mission). If an enemy shoots a missile, the player can try to avoid it using the stealth mode (pressing the start button) once per mission. The stealth mode will automatically turn off once the player passes out of the danger. If players manage to accomplish the mission perfectly, a bonus round is offered, and they have to try to take down as many enemies as they can.</p>\n<p>The game can be played by one or two player taking turns. A second player can also take control of the aircraft closest to the center of the radar, either in one or two player mode.</p>",

This game is a side scroller, somewhat reminiscent of <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/bionic-commando\">Bionic Commando</a> in which you fight through a level then move to an overhead map to decide where to go next. In between levels, Wasp gives you hints.</p>\n<p>Captain America's attacks are: when he is standing, shield throw; when he is crouching, punch and when he is jumping, kick. Also, if you push twice in a direction, Cap can do a powerful forward charge with his shield for a short distance.</p>\n<p>Hawkeye's attacks are all arrow shots. He can shoot left, right, up, upper-left or upper-right.</p>\n<p>If you complete an area with one character then complete it with the other character right away, you can press start to switch between Cap or Hawkeye. This has the advantage that Cap's forward charge is powerful and by grabbing poles, he can then jump to areas Hawkeye cannot.</p>\n<p>Hawkeye can shoot enemies or targets too high for Cap to jump up and kick.</p>\n<p>In the battle mode, this is a two player, one-on-one battle. Player one chooses from Captain America or Hawkeye (the good guys) and player two chooses from Wizard, Ultron or Crossbones (the bad guys).</p>\n<p>You fight each other until one player has won three rounds.</p>",

To do so, Dirk will throw weapons such as knives, axes, or fire balls at various enemies, including dragons, bats, snakes, the Lizard King (who will steal gold from him), etc. He will also do a lot of jumping and ducking to avoid threats along his way, such as falling bridges, presses, spikes and holes on the floor. To complete a stage, all he has to do is to get to the end of it alive.</p>\n<p>At the end of some stages, Dirk will take an elevator that will lead him to other stages. The elevator makes short stops at some platforms, and you have to decide if Dirk will jump onto that platform or another. If he takes the wrong platform, he may go back to a previous stage and go through it all over again. From the elevator, Dirk can also get to a bonus level, the Lizard King's throne room, where he can try to recover the gold the King has stolen from him.</p>\n<p>Although Dirk has a life bar, he will instantly die when taking damage from most of the threats. He also has a \"candle bar\", which is used (by pressing the start button) to light up dark places and to discover hidden items at specific locations.</p>\n<p>The game can be played by two players taking turns. The PAL version has faster gameplay, additional enemies (including level bosses), death animations and splash screens in between the levels.</p>",

This would not be so bad except for two burglars, Harry and Marv, aka the Wet Bandits, have decided to burglarize his house. However, Kevin is too smart to play victim and will use the items he has available to make traps for the burglars.</p>\n<p><em>Home Alone</em> is a side scroller. Controlling Kevin, the player must wander around Kevin's house picking up icons representing different kinds of traps. He then drops these icons onto the ground, in the path of one of the burglars, stunning them and earning a score. Once stunned, Kevin can walk past them and continue collecting trap icons.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Flintstones and the Rubbles were enjoying a fine day when suddenly, someone from the future called Dr. Butler arrived and stole their pets, Dino and Hoppy! Butler plans to feature the pets in his intergalactic zoo, and what's worse, he's destroyed the Great Gazoo's time machine so that no-one could stop him! It's up to everyone's favourite caveman, Fred Flintstone, to find the pieces to the time machine and repair it, so that they can travel to the future and confront Dr. Butler once and for all!</p>\n<p><em>The Flintstones: The Rescue of Dino &amp; Hoppy</em> is a side-scrolling platformer for the NES. In it, you control Fred Flintstone through various locations such as Bedrock, Reef Rock, the Jungle and more as he searches for the missing pieces of Gazoo's time machine. Fred has his trusty club which he can use to attack with, or charge up it's power by holding B for a more deadly attack. Fred can collect coins after defeating enemies, which are used to pay for secondary weapons like slingshots and tomahawks, as well as special abilities such as flying and diving.</p>\n<p>After completing the first level, the player is presented with an overworld map that allows you to choose which level you'd like to go to. There are also basketball courts on the map - if you beat your opponent in a game of basketball, you can earn one of the special abilities which are required for use later.</p>",

Like the original game, you are equipped with a mallet, which can be used to smash enemies. You can then pick these enemies up and toss them at others. When you do this, they leave behind a gem that can be collected for points. During your travels, you can break open chests that contain goodies such as scrolls, extra energy, and more weapons. </p>\n<p>You exit an area by entering through an open doorway, but some doors are locked and must be opened with a key.

Ginji, Penko's current boyfriend, sends his goons out to stop you by throwing food at you! So you must avoid or destroy his goons, collect Fat-B-Gone, and make it to the end of the level in time not to mention you must be thin enough.</p>\n<p><em>Yume Penguin Monogatari</em> is a platform game in which you must help Penta lose weight. As Penta, you can move faster and jump higher when you're thinner, you also have different attacks at every level... er... shape. When you're chubby, you jump into the air and belly-flop your opponents, when you're normal, you kick things, and when you're thin, you shoot things.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Attack Animal Gakuen</em> is inspired by Sega's popular <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1434/space-harrier/\">Space Harrier</a>, but with a cuter setting. As in its role model, you fly towards the screen or run on the ground, rendered in a checkered 3D field. The hero has been replaced with a uniform-clad schoolgirl, who must shoot down enemies which come flying, jumping or crawling towards her. The enemies are no longer spaceships, asteroids or dragons. Instead, they are various cute and furry animals, such as kangaroos, cacti with sweatbands, turtles and flies. The end-of-level dragons are also decidedly cuter, with the first level boss being a fluffy koala. <em>Attack Animal Gakuen</em> is one of few Famicom games to support the 3D glasses (like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/15879/space-harrier-3-d/\">Space Harrier 3-D</a> for the Master System), though it is perfectly playable without glasses.</p>",

In order to save a baby, Tokoro-san must traverse Tokyo, armed only with a water pistol. Cute nasties which look like fantasy creatures run at him and must be shot down. Others come out of holes in the ground beneath collapsing platforms, and certain monsters will, when shot, run away from Tokoro-san and run down all monsters in their path. Shooting the pistol will use up the water reserve, which will decrease the range of the shots. Leaving enemies alone when possible is therefor a good strategy. When Tokoro-san enters a house, a boss battle must be run through before he can choose a path to other districts in the town. When the player is hit too many times by monsters, or the water pistol runs out of water, the game is over.</p>",

The king is sick and Kool must gather the seven magical herbs to cure him within three days.</p>\n<p>Unlike most platformers, momentum is very important in Kid Kool. He takes several steps to get up to full speed when running and cannot stop on a dime. There is no air control, so how far he is able to jump depends entirely on how fast he was going when he left the ground.</p>\n<p>Kool faces a variety of enemies. They can be defeated by jumping on their heads. The first jump drives them into the ground and the second eliminates them. They also can be beaten with a furry companion that Kool can pick up by running fast enough past the appropriate spots. He can be thrown with the B button, then retrieved by standing near him. He also affords some protection as if Kool is hit while holding him, he will only lose his companion, not a life.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Big Bird's Hide and Speak</em> is an edutainment title for based on the <em>Sesame Street</em> license. It is designed to teach early recognition, memorization and reading skills to young children. It is one of the few NES games to use digitized speech thanks to a special chip included in the cartridge.</p>\n<p>There are six modes divided into three groups of two. In all modes, Big Bird stands outside an apartment building with four windows. Little Bird sits on top of one of the windows and acts a cursor. Players use the D-pad to move Little Bird to the correct window and press the A-button when they find it.</p>\n<p>The first group of modes teaches simple name-recognition skills. Four Sesame Street characters walk into the building and appear at the windows. Big Bird calls out their name and the player must choose the character whose name is called. The windows can be left open or shut to teach memorization.</p>\n<p>The second group of modes teaches kids to recognize letters. As before, four Sesame Street characters enter the building. Now, letters appear in the windows along with the characters. Big Bird says the name of a letter, which you must then find. This mode also can have the windows left open or shut.</p>\n<p>The third group of modes teaches basic spelling. Letters appear with the characters as in the previous mode. In the first version of this mode, Big Bird calls out a three-letter word to spell. You must then select the letters in the correct order. The final mode is timed. The sun starts at the top of the screen and play continues until it drops below the fence. There are groups of four letters again, however Big Bird does not instruct you what to spell this time. You must pick out words from the list yourself. After each word, a new batch of letters is revealed. The object is to see how many words you can spell before the sun sets.</p>",

This time, some unknown force is causing havoc throughout the island. And what's worse is that Higgins's 5 dinosaur pals are kidnapped. Naturally, it is up to our straw-skirt-wearing prehistoric hero to save the day.</p>\n<p><em>Takahashi Meijin no B\u014dkenjima IV</em> is Famicom's final installment of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=hudson\">Adventure Island series</a>. Many familiar elements from the previous titles are present like Higgins's girlfriend, the island itself and his skateboard. But in addition to his usual tomahawk and boomerang, Higgin's will also get to use various new items like the parasol and the water-bubble gun.</p>\n<p>Higgins starts off the game outside his hut with his girlfriend waving him goodbye. He's armed only with bones to throw at enemies. </p>\n<p>Instead of the conventional \"stages\" Higgins has the whole island to explore. The only problem is some areas are blocked off until bosses are defeated while other is inaccessible until Higgins obtained the necessary item.</p>\n<p>These items can be obtained by either defeating bosses or winning mini-games. Scattered throughout the island are critters who challenges you to a certain mini-game. The first one you will encounter is the whack-a-mole game but there is also a shooting gallery and races to compete in.</p>\n<p>When a dinosaur is saved, you can ride it and use its powers (i.e. flying or flame-shooting). To make traveling from one area to the next easier, you are given the warp-egg. By placing it on a special mantle that's located throughout the island, you can warp to where the egg is at any time.</p>\n<p>The select screen acts as an inventory for all of your obtained items. When you receive the compass, selecting it will show you a map of the area in which you are currently located. </p>\n<p>There is no save in the game, instead you can receive a password by taking a break in your hut. The password will act as a way to continue from where you left off.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The NES version of <em>The Punisher</em> is an on-rails shooter. It puts the player in control of Frank Castle from behind, as he trades fire with the gangs of some of his classic enemies. Aside from being one of the few NES rail shooters, the game features an uncommon amount of destructible items in its levels. You also have the ability to move Frank to the left or right of the screen to dodge incoming fire, or to hold down the fire button to lock him in place and move the aiming cursor.</p>\n<p>The game features six \"missions\" with a number of varying environments and levels within them. Standard pickups of armour and increased firepower are present, as well as grenades which can be launched with the B button. Earning a 100% kill rating (as The Punisher would surely try to do) gives an unlimited \"Super Gun\" upgrade for the next stage.</p>",

They find a planet high in minerals, and they name it Selim.</p>\n<p>But soon they discover that there is someone watching, spying on them; it's some kind of alien race. These aliens find a hole in the humans' main computer and get inside it. The computer, programmed to self-destruct in case of a failure, starts its countdown.</p>\n<p>There is only one way to avoid self-destruction, which is entering a 14 digit code into the machine; but these digits are hidden in the walls of the corridors in the complex. Your mission is to find these letters and avoid self-destruction, aboard the \"Red Warrior\", and using your only weapon, an energy ball.</p>\n<p>Crackout is an <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Arkanoid\">Arkanoid</a> clone for the NES, but it's probably one of the most singular clones. You'll have to destroy all blocks but also the walls surrounding them, as the 14 letters are spread inside them, apart from killing the alien bosses here and there. In your way, you will find a bizarre mixture of enemies, from alien forms to parts of the body (eyes, lips, skulls...), who will make your game tougher by changing the direction of your ball; but also happier by dropping a sweet variety of power-ups such as the cherries (extra life), the clock (the enemies freeze), a rocket (to throw into the blocks), a fire device (the ball fires missiles), a parachute (slows the ball) an extra ball, or the weirdest of them all, the so-called Konami Man, who will take you to a secret parallel complex with different (and harder) levels.</p>",

Each Planeteer is endowed with a special elemental power which is used to combat pollution, preserve the environment and keep everything ship-shape. When the Planeteers combine powers, a superhero - Captain Planet, guardian of the Earth - is summoned. The powers of Gaia keep watch over the world, and assign the Planeteers to where they are needed.</p>\n<p><em>Captain Planet and the Planeteers</em> is an action sidescroller game divided into two sections: inside levels and outside levels. Outside levels usually put the Planeteers in some kind of vehicle which can move in any of eight directions on the screen. The planeteers can use any of their elemental powers, drained from an energy bar: Fire shoots a fireball directly ahead, Water shoots out a water wave, Wind lets loose defensive air currents, Earth tosses stones out of the earth and Heart calms animal creatures. Touching an enemy or projectile results in instant death. </p>\n<p>Inside levels summon Captain Planet himself, who can punch or turn himself into a swirling version of any of the five elements. Captain Planet can also move/fly in any of eight directions and also can only take one hit before dying. Power-ups can also be found on these levels.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Radically different from other racquet sports such as tennis, badminton uses a high-drag shuttle which gives it an irregular path. In this video game adaptation, the player controls the Japanese player in a competition against five opponents: Canada, USA, UK, South Korea and China. Each match is played on best-of-five sets, played to 15 (boys) or 11 (girls) points. Four different courts can be chosen.</p>\n<p>Along the d-pad, two buttons are used to control the player - one to swing the racquet, and other to jump. By following the shadow of the shuttle the player can position himself correctly, and then hit it in perfect timing, giving it enough power and lift to reach the opponent's side, and then (hopefully) descend out of the opponent's reach. Jumping allows the player to hit the shuttle downwards but still over the net, reducing the reaction time for a proper return drastically.</p>",

These alternate widget forms include a cannon, a mouse, a rock-man, a bird-man, and a dolphin. Transforming uses up magic points which must be replenished.

Before they managed to understand anything, a small pink alien with a strict-looking face came out of the space ship and announced that the end of the century is near - and something extraordinary will happen in the year 1999.</p>\n<p>That's where the game begins. You can play as one (or two, in 2-player mode) of the students, competing against the others. You must prepare for the upcoming end of the century, earn enough money, and generally manage your life well. This is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Monopoly\">Monopoly</a>-like board game, only instead of dices you use cards. The characters are represented by small cars on a city map. The number that appears on the card you pull from the deck represents the amount of squares your car can move on the map. Each square leads to a different event: accident, romantic meeting, promotion, etc. Some of the events allow you to make an additional choice. For example, if you land in a casino, you'll be asked if you want to gamble. Answering \"yes\" will lead to a slot machine mini-game.</p>",

Your goal is to make it through elementary school and high school, to build up his personality (making him more attractive, etc.), and finally let him be drafted by a professional baseball team. All this is achieved through playing (alone, vs. computer, or in two-, three-, and four-player mode) a board game in which you take your hero through a series of fields. Unlike most similar games, the amount of fields you can advance is not determined by a dice roll, but by a moving power meter that you must stop at the right time in order to jump the desired amount of fields. Needless to say that those fields have very different effects on the participants. There are different stats (like stamina, charisma, etc.) that can be increased or reduced if you step on a particular field. For example, you might end up on a \"eating\" field, which will take you to a friend who will invite you to a dinner. This will result in increased weight, a parameter that will affect your future performance.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This game has two modes: story and tournament. Tournament mode is the simpler one: you compete against seven opponents in a quiz that concerns various historical, geographical, social, and cultural aspects of United States of America. Some questions require you to choose \"yes\" or \"no\", while others present you a short list of possible answers, of which you should choose the correct one. The participants' responses are timed.</p>\n<p>In the story mode, you can navigate the character you created (male or female) in a top-down city. Avoiding getting hit by the numerous cars in the area, you must make your way to competition halls and participate in quiz shows. More areas will be unlocked as you win the tournaments. This time, giving the correct answer is more than just quickly choosing a word. Giving an answer is presented each time with a mini-game. For example, in one of the competitions answering a question involves running through a football field and making it to the correct part of the touchdown area, which is divided into large \"yes\" and \"no\" sections.</p>",

In the \"game mode\", he is brought in a helicopter onto a top-down \"world map\" area. He is told that this is Brooklyn, New York, and begins to roam the area, gradually gaining access to different casino houses. There are also random encounters, during which he is able to bet some money and directly operate a slot machine from the world map.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The game is based on a popular anim\u00e9 series for children. The hero Anpanman is the son of the baker Jam-ojisan. His head is made entirely out of bread and bean jam. He rescues starving creatures, to whom he gives parts of his head to eat, and fights the evil Baikinman (\"Germ Man\") and his minions.</p>\n<p>This game contains five mini-games, some of which have educational purposes. The game is controlled entirely by a special mouse-like device which is shipped with it. The mini-games are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Try to catch the apples Anpanman drops from the sky by running around a small field.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Combine puzzle pieces together to create images of the anim\u00e9's characters.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Practice to write Japanese syllables (hiragana) with the help of Anpanman.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Figure out the differences between similar pictures.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Uncover characters' faces by clicking on empty spaces on a board. Uncovering an enemy's face will make you fail (a concept not unlike <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Minesweeper\"> Minesweeper</a>).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p>Long time ago, an advanced civilization existed in the Solar System. But one day, a black hole appeared nearby. Many people were sucked into it an transported into another dimension, which they named Artelius. It was ruled by the evil king Sarbelor, who constructed a machine named Galax, which tore the dimension into lonely asteroid-filled spaces accessed by warp points. The peace-loving scientist Dr. Rado built you, a cyborg who can travel through space, and entrusted you with the mission of finding and destroying Sarbelor.</p>\n<p>This game is an action RPG. You navigate the hero in top-down view through space; chains of asteroids represent inaccessible areas on the map. You travel between various space areas by approaching warp points. The enemies randomly appear on the screen around you. When you contact an enemy, a battle begins. Battles are viewed from first person perspective; you are in control of a cross-hair, which you must move around the screen and press the fire button when you place it over the enemy. There are also special attacks at your disposal, which require weapon points (WP). Winning the battles gives you experience points, allowing you to gain levels (\"classes\") and become stronger.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Asmik is not only a name of a game-developing company, but, as we learn from this game, also a cute little pink dragon. Recently, monsters began to invade the peaceful country of the dragons. The only way to stop this invasion is to contact the six Dragon Gods. Unfortunately, those gods seem to be asleep. So now Asmik must travel all over the world to find six magical splitters, that will help him to awaken the dragons and to defeat the monsters.</p>\n<p>This is a traditional action platform game. Asmik can jump and exhale steam from his nostrils to turn all his enemies into eggs. Those eggs can be eaten and later used for various purposes (during boss battles, acquiring upgrades at a shop that becomes available once you have completed a stage, etc.). Asmik dies if he comes into close contact with an enemy. Boss battles differ from the rest of the game, each one being a mini-game of its own, for example a rock-paper-scissors game during which Asmik uses his correct choices to gain time to proceed to the next stage.</p>",

Only one construction still remains on the planet \u2013 a highway called Black Line. It is said than an ancient legend is somehow connected to this highway. You, a man named Riber, decide to participate in a racing competition on the Black Line. But be ready \u2013 the competition can bring deadly results...</p>\n<p>In this racing game, you drive your car on the highway through pseudo-3D environments. The opponents will not hesitate to push you outside the road. You can either squeeze between them (pressing the Down button will make your car smaller), or shoot at them with a limited amount of missiles. On the way there will be shops where you'll be able to repair and upgrade your car.</p>",

In fact, after the mighty battle with the hero Kuros, Malkil retreated to a nearby self-contained castle kingdom and conducted a hostile takeover. Kuros comes on the scene and must attempt to relieve Malkil of his ill-gotten command of the kingdom, its subjects, and especially its princesses.</p>\n<p>The third game in the <em>Wizards &amp; Warriors</em> series features a similar feel to the first two games in that Kuros' movements are very quick and nimble. The player also has the ability to control Kuros' sword swing movements. However, Kuros has three different character classes to alternate between-- the knight, the thief, and the wizard. Each represents trade-offs between speed, attack strength, and defense strength. There are various guilds throughout the game devoted to training knights, thieves, and wizards where the player must complete challenging obstacle courses in order to increase their character class level.</p>\n<p>The gameplay proceeds up a large vertical city/castle with dangerous, monster-filled hallways and caverns. Kuros must kill monsters, gather money, buy goods and services, raise his character class levels, rescue a variety of apprehended princesses and gather special jewels, all in a quest to face off with Malkil once again.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This game is a humorous \"star simulation\", or, better to say, a strategy game with elements of luck, in which your goal is to become a famous musician or a star of the Japanese theater, particularly succeeding in <em>monomane</em>, a technique of imitation. There are four characters in the game which are controlled by players or computer. The turns of the game are determined by a roll of dice. The characters are located on a city map, and move around it according to the number that their dice rolled, somewhat similarly to monopoly-type board games. Each time you stop, you access a location where various things happen: you can select theater pieces and perform on stage, try to impress people, etc. Sometimes you land on a location that leads to a mini-game (swimming, playing ball, and others). Winning such a game gives an additional boost to your career.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Banana is a puzzle game based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=mole-mole\">Mole Mole</a> games, where you have to navigate a mole through various levels, making it to the exit. The task is not as simple as it sounds. First, the mole cannot jump or climb up unless there is a ladder nearby. So you have to plan your route ahead, otherwise you can get stuck at the bottom. Second, boulders will fall and block your way. And third, you have a wife. You should first find her, and then lead her securely to the exit. The wife will sometimes make things harder, forcing you to find alternate ways to the exit. But sometimes she'll also be helpful, pushing away boulders and clearing the road for you. </p>\n<p>On every level, there is also various food scattered around, primarily bananas. You'll be able to complete a level if you have gathered enough of those fruits. You'll also gain superpowers from bananas that will allow you to skip level sections that you find too difficult. The entire game is played only with the four directional buttons. There are no enemies and you cannot die - although you can get irrevocably stuck, in which case you'll have to restart a level.</p>",

The only hope to save the beloved Earth lies with you, a young warrior named Dan. You are sent in a time machine to the year 1999, when the monster invasion was beginning. Your task is to find your way through monster-infested labyrinths and to defeat the Increaser \u2013 whatever he (or it) is.</p>\n<p>The game is an action platformer with more emphasis on exploration than on \"jump &amp; run\" gameplay. You don't die immediately if a monster touches you, but have a life bar that gets gradually depleted as you are hit. Defeated enemies bring you energy points, which you can spend to buy upgrades. You start with a sword, but later obtain other weapons as well. The game's structure is not entirely linear; many areas have different doors leading to different places.</p>",

You play as a little boy who has to collect treasure without being killed by those ferocious creatures. The only thing you can do to immobilize the enemies is setting a trap right before they approach you. This gives you an opportunity to gain some valuable time. The enemies will pop out of the traps a few seconds later. The game is divided into levels with increasing difficulty. At each level, your goal is to collect all the treasure before you can proceed. You die if you allow an enemy to touch you.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the year 1999, the world is suddenly facing intensive natural disasters. Scientists are perplexed and decide that research on the inside of the earth is needed. To this end, an underground vehicle is constructed to explore the underworld. They call it the VZR, but the crew know it more commonly as a Wurm. Four different Wurms have already been dispatched and mysteriously disappeared, so a fifth Wurm vehicle is ready to launch crewed by the best and the brightest. Crew Chief Moby has been chosen to lead the mission, even though she has lost both her love and father on previous Wurm missions. It will be up to her and the crew to figure out this mystery and rescue the other Wurm members. There's also a matter of mysterious crystals that have been found underground...</p>\n<p><em>Wurm: Journey to the Center of the Earth</em> is a game featuring multiple sequences. The player controls the VZR vehicle, and occasionally Captain Moby when she ventures out on foot in vertically and horizontally scrolling sequences as well as a first person battle against enemy monsters. Players progress through 5 levels, in which the VZR-5 investigates the fate of the other VZRs. After the completion of each level, the player gains a crystal, which will unlock additional weapons for the VZR, mentioned below.</p>\n<p>The VZR is controlled in both a side-scrolling sequence and a top-down vertically scrolling sequence. In the side-scrolling section, the VZR is able to change between Tank Mode and Hover Modes mode. In the top-view section, the VZR is able to change between Hover Mode and Aerial Mode. The Tank mode drives along the ground, firing in three directions and uses a drill to tear down obstacles. The Hover Mode can fly around the screen, but uses fuel constantly while doing so. Like the tank mode, It can also fire in three directions and has the drill, however the weapon can be changed to two power-ups: energy balls that fly across the screen and a wave weapon the shoots out in both directions. The Aerial Mode is a fighter jet form and sacrifices the obstacle-clearing drill for a laser weapon which bounces off of walls. In all forms, the VZR has a Life bar and a fuel bar, either of which will end the game if it runs out (though Tank mode does not use the fuel). Defeated enemies will sometimes drop fuel restore power-ups.</p>\n<p>The VZR also engages enemy monsters in a first person shooter game. The player moves the perspective of the VZR left and right, and is able to fire the weapon. There is a \"Possibility\" percentage on the screen that determines when the player is able to kill the enemy creature. This possibility must reach 100% before the battle is over. In order to raise this possibility, the player can attack the monster's weak point... slowly driving it up, or the player can \"talk\" to crewmates on the VZR who will analyze the monster with sensors and move the the Possibility value up (or down). Players can also change between different weapons, some of which are more effective than others, all of which are fired the same way on the screen.</p>\n<p>When Captain Moby leaves the VZR vehicle, the action changes to a side-scrolling platform game. Moby must navigate her way through a maze of different rooms, looking for the objects or persons required for her to open different locked doors. Moby's only abilities are a jump, a karate kick and a pistol. Moby has an ammo bar which determines how many times she can use her pistol, and a life bar, which ends the game if it runs out.</p>",

You are a brave warrior who has accepted the challenge of rectifying this situation. Using only a boomerang for offense, the hero descends into the depths of the underworld. The game begins with a flying/shooting side scrolling level and then proceeds to walking/jumping side scrolling action. All kinds of undead creatures (mostly skeletons) are waiting to destroy you.</p>\n<p>Audibly, the game makes liberal use of digitized voices, a rarity for 8-bit NES games.</p>",

The other championship available restricts the choice to the 4 first teams: France, England, United States and Argentina. Each national team has its own characteristics, varying in offensive, defense, speed, skill, accuracy and experience traits.</p>\n<p>After selecting the team, players are prompted to choose the color of their team's uniform, among white, green, gray and red. They are also prompted to choose the duration of the periods (15, 30 or 45 minutes - which run faster than real time). They are also prompted to choose team formation: 4-3-3, 4-2-4 or 4-4-2.</p>\n<p>The game is played from a side-scrolling perspective. While conducting the ball layers can make short passes (with button B) or strong kicks (with button A, stronger the longer the button is held). Without the ball's possession, players can try to steal the ball (with button A) or skip to the next player (with button B). The goalkeeper control is manual, and players can make the goalkeeper jump (by pressing button A). Tied matches are decided on a penalty kick contest.</p>\n<p>Players can also watch single computer vs. computer matches.</p>",

The \"Olympic\" championship available restricts the choice to the 4 first teams: Internacional, Flamengo, S\u00e3o Paulo and Vasco. Each team has its own characteristics, varying in offensive, defense, speed, skill, accuracy and experience traits.</p>\n<p>After selecting the team, players are prompted to choose the color of their team's uniform, among white, green, gray and red. They are also prompted to choose the duration of the periods (15, 30 or 45 minutes - which run faster than real time). They are also prompted to choose team formation: 4-3-3, 4-2-4 or 4-4-2.</p>\n<p>The game is played from a side-scrolling perspective. While conducting the ball layers can make short passes (with button B) or strong kicks (with button A, stronger the longer the button is held). Without the ball's possession, players can try to steal the ball (with button A) or skip to the next player (with button B). The goalkeeper control is manual, and players can make the goalkeeper jump (by pressing button A). Tied matches are decided on a penalty kick contest.</p>\n<p>Players can also watch single computer vs. computer matches.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Death Race</em> is seemingly inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/183813/sylvester-stallone/\">Sylvester Stallone</a> movie <em>Death Race 2000</em> released 15 years before this game. The object of the game is to run down innocent pedestrians in your souped-up automotive grim reaper. Progress through the race courses in 8 U.S. cities, moving from west to east starting with San Diego and Phoenix. Each race consists of capturing a flag and finding the exit door, all while squishing or gunning down as many people on foot as possible while avoiding helicopters and heat seeking missiles that are actively trying to discourage this unique hobby. If the time runs out, a barrage of missiles descends on the player's car to indicate that the race is over.</p>\n<p>The player has a certain amount of money to begin with and earns more money for completing the races alive. This money can be used to upgrade the engine, steering, tires, chassis, or weapon systems on the car.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Galaxy 5000 is an isometric-perspective space racing game where 4 spaceships compete head to head in outer space races. 1 or 2 human players can compete in the races; the rest of the ships are controlled by the computer. The ships complete several laps around each course and have limited firing capacity to throw their opponents off balance. The ships can also jump. In fact, the ships can jump right off the edge of the course and drop down (in space). If the player does not complete a course in good time, the entire race track will disintegrate and leave the ship to fall down (and apparently splash into some water below).</p>\n<p>A notable item about this game is its use of squeaky, comical, digitized voices for exclamations when colliding with another player (\"Hey!\", \"Excuse me!\", \"Watch it!\"). There are also 2 completely different control schemes that a player can adopt for cruising around the course. The first scheme rotates and drives the ship in the direction that the control pad is being pressed. The second scheme uses left and right to rotate the ship and up to thrust in the direction the nose is pointing.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Gametek's faithful NES recreation of the long-running international quiz show. Up to three contestants can play at once, with gaps optionally filled in by computer AI. If three human players are engaged, then Player 1 and 2 share the first controller, with the second controller going to Player 3.</p>\n<p>For the first two rounds, six categories with five questions each are randomly selected by the computer to populate the game board. The contestant who answered the last question correctly gets to pick the category and a dollar value, with harder questions being worth more money. Players have ten seconds from the time a question appears to \"ring in\" with the appropriate controller button and answer. </p>\n<p>Answers are built by using the controller to navigate around a grid of letters and \"type\" out the correct answer. Spaces and punctuation are ignored, but spelling and grammar generally must match the expected answer exactly. The contestant has 30 seconds to provide the answer before \"time is up\" and the other players have the opportunity to ring in.</p>\n<p>Final Jeopardy consists of one category, which players bet their current winnings on being able to answer. A single question from that category is asked after the hidden bets have been placed. Again, each player has 30 seconds to provide their answer while the other players are instructed to look away. At the end, scores are tallied and the winner declared.</p>\n<p>Categories in this edition draw from general knowledge and do not follow a specific theme (like the sports or Star Wars editions). Each category will always consist of the same five questions, and the game draws on a limited number of categories. Repeats will appear after a handful of sessions played. Some questions \"current\" for 1987 will also be less obvious decades later, and more difficult than intended.</p>",

        "description": "<p>When the rulers of planet Neptune find that they are running out of their main food source \u2013 man-ham \u2013 they hit on a devious plan: Invade the nearby planet earth and melt the polar ice-caps, thus sinking all cities. Then imprison the human creatures in underwater factories where they can be turned into a fresh source of man-ham.</p>\n<p>The plan goes perfectly. The leaders of earth's nations are taken completely by surprise as the ice-caps melt and the globe is flooded. It seems that humanity will meet its end on the dinner plates of the Neptunian monsters. But wait! One hope remains, in the form of evil pirate Narikeen, who has been the scourge of the world's nations, pillaging and causing general distress in his pink submarine, Sqoon. The leader of the world's ailing defense force turns to this former public enemy number 1, and with some difficulty manages to convince Narikeen to save the world.</p>\n<p>In this side-scrolling shooter, you control Narikeen's sub, Sqoon. Sqoon is equipped with two weapons; an upgradable missile launcher which shoots straight ahead to take out the weird Neptunian enemies and an ice-bomb which shoots horizontally downwards to blow up factories and other installations. Destroying these buildings releases the humans inside, who then float out so you can rescue them. When you have nine people on-board, a small mobile island will appear on the surface, allowing you to drop off the humans and re-fuel. You'll need to save a lot of people and re-fuel regularly, as your sub only lasts about 60 seconds on one tank of gas. There are eight levels in the game, each set in a different (sunken) country.</p>",

Unlike any other game adaption of the film, this version takes several drastic liberties with the overall story and character meetings.</p>\n<p>The game is a side-scrolling platformer that has Luke begin his travels on Tatooine.  While Luke eventually travels to the Death Star and Yavin IV, he travels to other planets such as Kessell, Iscalon, and Hoth to rescue his imprisoned friends before he flies his X-Wing fighter during the final Death Star trench run.  Along the way, he fights against Tusken Raiders, Stormtroopers, Boba Fett, and rides in vehicles such as his Landspeeder... or a whale on Hoth.</p>\n<p>At the end of each level, there is a boss fight that squares Luke against Darth Vader look-alikes, who transform into various creatures such as scorpions, pterodactyls, sharks and more.</p>",

Right after the demon Druaga stole the Blue Crystal Rod, the goddess Ishtar sends the priestess Ki to retrieve it.</p>\n<p>The player controls Ki in her way up the 60 tower's levels. As in the original game, she must find the key to exit each floor of the tower in a limited time. But unlike the original, this game is a platformer, and the player controls an unarmed Ki who must avoid the tower's mosters. To make her way up, she can dash and jump, and she'll keep getting higher as long as the jump button is held. If she hits a ceiling when jumping or a wall when dashing, she'll drop to the ground and be stunned by a moment.</p>\n<p>Ki will also find chests with items to help her (like warps to higher levels of the tower or wings that will help her control her \"floating), which effects will last only until she leaves the floor where she found them.</p>",

The ship's weapons can be fired in tow directions and defeated enemies sometimes drop power-ups that equip the ship with different weapons and up to two options. There are three different weapons in addition to the standard shot: Laser, homing missiles and bombs.</p>\n<p>The \"Edit Mode\" presents an unusual feature. In it, players can determine the options positions (which can be changed by pressing the A and B button simultaneously), as well as the properties of the weapons. It is, for example, possible to have the laser behave like homing missiles or the homing missiles like bombs.</p>",

Holding down the fire button activates a rotatable laser that is useful for discovering hidden power-up capsules.</p>\n<p>Despite carrying the same name as one of its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Super+Turrican\">big brothers</a>, Super Turrican for the NES is based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Turrican\">Turrican</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Turrican+II:+The+Final+Fight\">Turrican II</a>. While some levels are very similar to those found in Turrican I and II (with only slight changes of layout and enemy types), others are entirely new. </p>\n<p>Apart from different/new level design, there are other notable changes: Holding down the fire button let's Turrican run, there is no time limit to levels anymore, energy wheel usage is limitless and the shield isn't time based anymore, but can sustain a certain number of hits.</p>",

Battles occur randomly and the characters move and fight autonomously, although it is possible to pause battles at any time and order characters to fight, defend, use magic or items or flee. Furthermore, a basic battle strategy (attack, defend, stop or flee) can be selected from a tactics menu, where it is also possible to change the characters' starting formation.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Palamedes II can be described as \"<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/28739/palamedes/\">its predecessor</a>, turned upside down\". As before, your goal is to rearrange a set of dice and put them in a row for elimination. Only series of dice such as 4-4-4-4-4 or 1-2-3-4-5 can be eliminated, and depending on the series, this will result in one or several rows of dice to be eliminated from the screen. Unlike the original Palamedes, this time your character stands on top of the dice, and the growing pile of dice will crush him unless he makes the correct combinations to eliminate the pile. It's a bit like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tetris\">Tetris</a>, and a bit like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4642/klax/\">Klax</a>.</p>\n<p>Two modes are available: Mode 1 puts your player on top of a growing pile which must be eliminated. It can be played alone <em>(single)</em>, against another human <em>(match)</em> or in a <em>quest</em> against the computer. </p>\n<p>Mode 2 puts your player on an already well-stocked pile, but unlike mode 1, the stacks can't be rearranged in order to reach the desired dice, so you have to make do with what is in the top layer to match whatever dice is shown on top of the playfield. An opposing player does the same, and the first one to reach the bottom wins. If both players run out of matching dice, a countdown begins to reveal a new dice, and it's necessary to react quickly to find the matching one in your pile. Due to the nature of mode 2, it can't be played alone, only in <em>match</em> or <em>quest</em> mode.</p>",

Each track can be played either in single player mode or in head-to-head 2-player action on a split screen. There are 4 different cars to choose from and manual shifting is a consideration during racing, a facet often overlooked in simpler NES racing game scenarios. While the star of the game is Michael Andretti, who pops in before each race to offer useful advice about the current track, the game also has appearances by many other F-1 racing stars.</p>",

The assorted levels include the Poison Field, Guerrila Warfare, and Blazing Inferno. While armed with ninja bullets by default, he occasionally has the opportunity to pick up other offensive items such as ninja stars, boomerangs, or fireballs. Enemies obstructing Ninja Kid's quest include rolling eyeballs, crows, flying demons, Frankenstein monsters, and of course, other ninjas.</p>\n<p>The game begins in an overhead map that allows the player to wander into various side-scrolling levels. The levels go on an on until the player completes a particular task that makes a door appear. Going through the door sometimes leads outside to the overhead map and sometimes leads to a boss battle.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Mickey's Safari In Letterland chronicles Mickey Mouse's globetrotting adventures (on a slightly modified globe) to capture letters for educational purposes. Goofy assists with chauffeur and data processing duties. Mickey can venture into any of the following 6 territories: Yukon, Swamp, Forest, Jungle, Pyramid, and Caribbean. In each area, his mission is to collect three diamonds that contain letters. Doing so will spell a word. Then, Mickey ventures to the end of the level and collects a large slab. If Mickey collects the three diamonds in the stage to spell a 3-letter word, Mickey spells the word with digitized audio samples and says the word, complete with an illustration. Then, the slab that Mickey collected at the end of the stage is fed by Goofy through a large machine that spits out a letter. It is up to the player to identify which letter this is.</p>\n<p>This game is oriented towards very young children. As such, it is essentially impossible to fail. There are many enemies in the game but none actually inflict harm. Snakes, porcupines, hippos, alligators, and even baby seals-- Mickey just bounces off each. Mickey can also swim handily and sustain long falls.</p>\n<p>Further, the game allows the player to point at letters on a board and have Mickey say them using the cartridge's library of digitized mouse voice samples.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Last Starfighter</em> is based on the 1984 movie of the same name. The hero must single-handedly pilot an extraordinarily powerful starfighter to destroy an enemy armada. The action takes place in outer space from a side-scrolling perspective where the ship always remains lined up in the middle of the screen but is able to turn forwards and backwards while accelerating and decelerating. The ship can also collapse into a slimmer configuration. Enemies come at you from all directions and in all formations. Shoot them as quickly as possible while also disabling the enemy fleet's starcruisers as best you can.</p>\n<p>The game also features a 2-player mode where each player takes turns fighting the armada.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Following the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Rescue+Rangers\">first Rescue Rangers game</a>, the Rangers overcame the plot of their arch-nemesis Fatcat and locked him up in the prison/pound. However, Fatcat's henchmen have sprung him from prison by blimp. Suddenly a television news anchor is reporting that there is a bomb threat in a local restaurant. The Rescue Rangers take it upon themselves to save the day only to learn that the whole bomb scare was a diversion in order to allow Fatcat to steal an artifact known as the Urn of the Pharaoh. The team must track Fatcat and learn what he has in store for the stolen goods.</p>\n<p>Like the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Rescue+Rangers\">previous game</a>, <em>Chip &amp; Dale's Rescue Rangers 2</em> is a side-scrolling action game where 2 players can play simultaneously as Chip &amp; Dale, or 1 player can control either chipmunk. Our heroes must conquer a series of oversized (from their perspective) stages in order to thwart Fatcat's nefarious schemes. For example, the first stage has the chipmunks hopping across the tables, chairs, and counters of a restaurant, and on through the kitchen. Many enemies try to slow the player's progress. The chipmunks' offensive ability is to pick up any of the copious blocks that litter the landscape and toss it in any of 5 directions (sideways, up, and diagonal-up). Along the way, there are scattered RR blocks for the heroes to collect. The other members of the Rescue Rangers -- Monty, Gadget, and Zipper -- are on hand to lend help out at key junctures.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dirty Harry</em> is based on the popular Clint Eastwood movie character of \"Dirty\" Harry Callahan (rather than the specific movie \"Dirty Harry\"), a cop famous for his use of a .44 magnum for doing away with evildoers, and for his catchphrase, \"Go ahead, make my day.\" In fact, the game begins with a digitized sample of that quote. The game play consists primarily of side-scrolling action. Dirty Harry can punch and kick the copious thugs that assault him using their own fists, guns, baseball bats, nets, and dynamite. The hero can also pull is .44 and aim it in 5 directions in order to pick off enemies, but the ammo is limited. Further, Dirty Harry has a number of other tools at his disposal, provided he collects them.</p>\n<p>This is not a one-way side-scroller, however. There are some adventure elements as well, such as being able to walk through alleys to other streets and going through doors to enter building. Entering buildings provides even greater challenges, like snakes and laser flooring. Dirty Harry even takes the fight down to the sewer.</p>",

The game begins in the future, where the hero Kyle Reese must battle through a post-apocalyptic future in order to go back in time to 1984 Los Angeles. Once there, he must progress through various checkpoints as outlined by the main movie plot: Find Sarah Connor, shootout at the police station, and the climax in the factory. The main levels of the game consist of side-scrolling jumping and shooting action. In between levels are car chases where the Terminator attempts to run you down as you race to your next destination.</p>",

Some of the levels feature traditional jumping and shooting action. Other levels pit you against the gangsters in a first person shooter-style of gameplay where your character begins behind a wall, wraps around into an open area, and must take out the bad guys. When your character runs out of ammo, he slips back behind the wall to reload. These levels are accompanied with time limits and goals for the number of enemies you must kill.</p>",

Additionally the game features special moves in the form of specific combinations of directional moves that trigger unique attacks.

These moves vary among each fighter, as players can choose from 15 different fighters, each with their own stats and moves, and then compete against the others to see who gets the honor of becoming grandmaster.</p>\n<p>Additionally the game includes a story mode in which players can take control of a single martial artist and roam the countryside looking for challengers (the later done from a top-down map view). Starting abilities and health are minimal, but successfully defeating opponents will increase the player's health and allow the fighter to learn new moves and turn into the ultimate combatant.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Ta-Keed, the Prince of Darkness, has managed to escape from his supernatural penitentiary where he has had centuries to plot exactly how he will take revenge on those that locked him away. Emperor Hans sends his troops to deal with this threat, but they are no match for the ultimate evil one. As an alternative, the emperor summons the bearers of 4 Magical Bells. These 4 adventurers must make their way to the castle and work as a team if they are to destroy Ta-Keed.</p>\n<p>The first part of Little Samson has each of the 4 characters journeying from his or her home land to the emperor's palace. This gives the player an opportunity to explore that character's unique abilities which will be essential throughout the game.* Samson is a human who is reasonably fast and also possesses magnificent rock climbing prowess. He is able to scale walls and hang across ceilings, and also grab onto walls and ceilings while jumping. His offensive option is the ability to shoot bells straight ahead.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Kikira is the Dragon Lord. Since she has claws, she does not slip on ice. When she jumps, she can also fly for short bursts. She breathes fire in 2 intensities, depending on how long the player holds down the fire button. Her fireballs spread in arc patterns.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gamm is the Rock Lord. Since he is a living rock he is very strong. So strong in fact that spikes do not hurt him, which is very valuable in a number of situations. He is also very slow and has only a short leap. He has a powerful punch.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>K.O. is the Mouse Lord. He is tiny which allows him to enter areas that other team members can not. He is also extremely fast and the highest jumper of the team. However, he is the weakest member so he can not sustain very much damage. He has the same wall and ceiling traversal abilities as Samson. Offensively, he can drop time-delay bombs.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When all 4 characters reach the emperor's palace, they all jump into Samson's bell. Actually, Gamm and K.O. quietly jump into Samson's bell; Kikira initially refuses. After a brief fight (with the player controlling Samson), Kikira joins the effort. Throughout the rest of the game, the player can switch between any of the 4 characters by entering the sub-screen. Each character has their own power meter. However, all the characters share lives. If the presently selected character loses all of his or her power, then one life is lost. The player must swap between all 4 characters in order to complete the journey.</p>",

There are two characters you can play with. By pressing the Select button you can change from Fred to Barney and vice versa. Each character has unique abilities that are needed to complete certain parts of each stage. For example Fred can grab the edges of a roof or a hill and climb while Barney can hang from ropes and vines. In terms of weapons Fred has a bat which is stronger and can also be charged for extra power but it takes more time to use. Barney on the other hand has a slingshot and can shoot small rocks for ranged attacks but rather weak. There are also weapons like throwing axes and bowling balls that both can use.</p>",

He can also charge his sword to fire a magical projectile. The real power-up, however, is that he can transform into a flying dragon. When this happens, the game turns into a shmup-style game in which the scrolling moves at a constant rate and the dragon can shoot fireballs in a spread formation. Transforming into a dragon is restricted by a power meter.</p>\n<p>The game features six levels of action-- a snow level, a cave level, a water level, an industrial level, and a haunted castle level.

It's actually a well-armed car that can turn into a boat or a plane at opportune times. The action is fast vertical scrolling as the vehicle faces all manner of powerful vehicle threats from a well-funded terrorist enemy -- cars, trucks, helicopters, etc. Luckily, there are many powerups to collect along the way, both defensive and offensive.</p>",

His means of attack is to throw sais (daggers) directly in front of him which destroy the enemies. Various power-ups are also scattered around, many of which restore life or defense.</p>",

He can also summon the Red Condor \u2013 a harpoon that can be used for attacking or reaching higher places. Along the way you will find places where you can buy extra lives, different weapons and an improved version of the Red Condor.

        "description": "<p><em>WCW: World Championship Wrestling</em> is an isometric wrestling game of the National Wrestling Alliance. \nPlayers can choose to engage in one- or two-player matches as either 1vs1 solo bouts or 2vs2 tag-teams. Upon selecting a mode, players choose their characters from among twelve featured wrestlers from the NWA league. Licensed characters include: Rick Flair (\"Nature Boy\"), Sting, Lex Luger (\"Total Package\"), Mike Rotunda, Road Warrior Hawk, Road Warrior Animal, Steve Williams (\"\"Dr. Death\"), Kevin Sullivan (\"Gamemaster\"), Ricky Steamboat (\"The Dragon\"), Ric Steiner (\"Dogface Gremlin\"), Eddie Gilbert (\"Hotstuff\") and Michael P.S. Hayes. Each wrestler has unique abilities not shared by the other wrestlers, including finishing moves and rope toss.</p>\n<p>Prior to a match, the player is presented with a menu of eight \"moves\", of which the player chooses four to assign to the points of the directional pad. Once the match starts, the player is only able to use the four moves selected and the rope toss to attack the opponent. Each wrestler can move up, down, left and right inside the wrestling ring, climb the turnstiles at each corner and throw opponents out of the ring (where they will be disqualified if outside for 20 seconds). Each wrestler has a high damage \"finisher move\" which can only be performed when they are standing in the middle of the ring and the opponent's stamina bar is low.</p>",

Being wild children, Tom Sawyer and his best friend Huckleberry Finn are always getting into new adventures and one kind of trouble or another. So it's not entirely unexpected one day when Tom Sawyer heads off to school and realizes he is late...</p>\n<p><em>Square no Tom Sawyer</em> is a side-scrolling RPG that features characters and situations from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/222334/mark-twain/\">Mark Twain</a>'s Tom Sawyer novels. Players control Tom himself and up to three other characters who can join his party at any one time. In town, there are a variety of people that can be talked to and shops where items can be bought and sold. Outside of towns, monsters and fierce woodland animals are randomly encountered and must be battled with. </p>\n<p>When entering battle mode, the game shifts to a third-person view behind Tom's party. The player can issue commands such as Fight, Item, and Run to each of the characters in the party and these actions will occur in turn. Battles that are won earn the participating characters experience points. These experience points can be allocated to increase specific stats of characters. Players can accumulate new items for use in battle but never have to deal with equipping characters.</p>",

The latter sees itself as the successor state to the malevolent Badds, also known as the Nazz. One day, the Federation discovers that the Imperial leader Generalissimo Killt decides to complete an unfinished project codenamed \"Albatros\" and started by the Badds. The Federation sends their hero Super Joe to stop the Empire's plans, but he is captured. Ladd Spencer, a member of the special FF Battalion, is dispatched to rescue Super Joe and uncover the enemy's secrets.</p>\n<p>This version of <em>Bionic Commando</em> is loosely based on the original arcade game and its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8779/bionic-commando/\">computer ports</a>, having different levels and plot. The protagonist is a soldier with a bionic arm that extends and contracts. His arm allows him to grab on to fixed objects to swing around and climb up platforms, which is the only way to do so due to the lack of a jumping ability. The arm also grabs opponents and pulls them towards the player character.</p>\n<p>After most levels the Bionic Commando will receive items. Often these items are required to successfully complete other levels. Additionally, each level will require a different colored communicator in order to make sense of message traffic.</p>",

Also included (besides the turtles) are three other familiar fighters: Shredder, Casey Jones and Hothead.</p>\n<p>The turtles did lose their trademark weapons and are restricted to unique melee attacks and kicks. Each character additionally has a set of special moves which can be performed with certain button combinations. Also each fighter can perform a fireball move, but has to collect a power up first which drops in the area from time to time.</p>\n<p>The game includes a story mode, where you can only select one of the turtles in a quest to face-off with the Shredder, a vs. mode (two fighters, the second either controlled by AI or a second player) and a tournament mode with four fighters.</p>",

It is a side-scrolling game, with a blue dressed Batman fighting enemies such as robots, jet-packed soldiers, ninjas and mutants.</p>\n<p>The game consists in five levels somewhat related to the movie: Gotham City streets (with Killer Moth as the final boss), AXIS Chemical Factory (with Machine Intelligence System as boss), Underground Conduit (with Electrocutioner as boss), the Laboratory Ruins (the Dual-Container Alarm as boss) and Gotham's Cathedral (with Firebug as boss) where Batman finally faces the Joker. Before each level, a cutscene with scenes from the movie is displayed.</p>\n<p>Besides his ever trusting punches, Batman has plenty of weapons in his utility belt: the Batarang, the Spear Gun and the Dirk (a three direction weapon). Batman has an ammunition counter shared for the three weapons. The Batarang takes one pellet per shot, the Spear Gun two pellets and the Dirk, three. Batman also has an eight hit life bar, which can be replenished by collecting hearts dropped by killed enemies. The enemies will also drop pellet items (10 pellets per item) and bonus items (which will only sum up points).</p>\n<p>Batman can also perform a \"wall jump\": he'll grab a wall when jumping toward it, allowing him to escalate some narrow passages. Batman has three lives and unlimited continues.</p>",

Nazis are trying to steal an experimental jet pack that will presumably give them a strategic edge in modern warfare for the purpose of world domination. It is up to the hero to don the jet pack and the helmet to stop the Nazis and keep the world safe.</p>\n<p>The Rocketeer is a side-scrolling, run-and-jump (and sometimes fly) game. About halfway through the first stage, the Rocketeer is able to scavenge jet fuel power-ups, in addition to health and ammo power-ups. The fuel power-ups allow him to use his namesake power and fly for short distances. The Rocketeer has 6 offensive options available from the start of the game, limited only by the amount of ammunition points he has in reserve: A punch (requires no ammo points and is therefore unlimited), pistol (1 ammo point per fire), tommygun (2 ammo points), spread gun (3 ammo points), grenade (5 ammo points), and a bazooka (20 ammo points).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise</em> is a board game adaptation of the Rock Man (Mega Man) series of games. It plays somewhat similar to <i>Itadaki Street/Fortune Street</i> board game. There is buying and selling of properties and construction of \"labs\" in order to earn points. Between 2 and 4 players can play, being controlled either by human players or the computer.</p>\n<p>Choosing the number of players and one of five characters: Dr. Wily, Dr. Right, Dr. Cossack, Kalinka and Roll, players must select which of four different boards to play. Upon starting, players begin each turn by rolling the dice and moving to the appropriate position on the board. Different squares on the board trigger events which can include receiving special cards, betting on hardhat races and random events. Players typically go around and around the board, collecting money every time they pass or land on the \"E Canister\" start square. Some boards feature different paths for the player to choose. Players landing on property are given the opportunity to buy it or pay rent to the player that owns it. </p>\n<p>Additionally, players can elect to build a lab on the property, even if they themselves don't own it. Thus it is possible to have separate owners for the property and lab. In those cases, rent is split between the two parties. Rent becomes more expensive when it is situated next to owners of the same kind. Thus, a line of labs or a line of properties owned by the same player will connect to each other and make the rent more expensive on each. Each property can only be bought once, however labs can be upgraded through four different phases, which is done only when the player lands on the property or activates a special bonus event. Players can also \"take over\" a lab or property from a player at any time, however the cost in doing so is more expensive than obtaining the property from the bank. Players can use cards they have collected at the beginning of each turn, each with it's own unique effects. </p>\n<p>Many boards feature a \"Robot Transform\" square that will change the player into one of Dr. Wily's robot masters for one complete rotation around the board. Transformations include Guts Man who will destroy labs he lands on, Shadow Man who will steal other player's cards and Dust Man who will steal the rent of properties he lands on.</p>\n<p>Each board has a specific objective in amount of money, property and labs required to win. The first player who reaches this amount ends the game. Rankings are then displayed for all players.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Gotcha! is an NES Zapper title based on the \"sport\" of paintball, and loosely tied into the paintball-themed movie caper of the same name. You are required to traverse three different battle zones, grab the opposing teams' flag from the opposite end of the field, and make it back to your flag without getting shot.</p>\n<p>One hand controls the Zapper while the other must hold the controller, since the D-Pad controls your movement up and down the field. Limited ammo is also a concern, as is the ability for the computer team to snag your flag and return it to their base to win. You can chase down and tag the flag carrier yourself to prevent this.</p>\n<p>The game contains three difficulty levels and three different zones (woods, city, snowfield) which cycle until you lose all of your lives. Numbers of enemies and their reaction time increase with each cycle. Aside from additional ammo, there are no powerups, no teammates, just you against the computer for a beat-your-highest-score challenge.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Jetsons: Cogwell's Caper</em> is based on the well-known Jetsons property from Hanna-Barbera. In this spin-off adventure, George Jetson is tasked my his employer to put a stop to the profit-making schemes of the rival Cogswell's company. To do this, George must hop from location to location in his jet and conquer each level using the resources available to him, as well as with the assistance of the other Jetson franchise characters.</p>\n<p>Cogswell's Caper is a side-scrolling action game where George Jetson can walk, crouch, and jump (actually, he's too lazy to jump and a jet pack handles the jumping duty for short bursts). Each level is littered with crates and other items that George can pick up and toss at enemies, while finding useful items (and occasionally even more enemies) underneath them. Since the game is set in the futuristic world of the Jetsons, there are also copious switches on walls which activate all kinds of features of the surroundings, such as a switch that reverses gravity for a brief time.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>The Black Bass</em> (originally <em>Black Bass II</em>) the player is an angler in a Black Bass fishing tournament. In this tournament, the player starts out on Lake Amanda as a rating C class angler in 200th position. The player has to find a good position on the lake to fish as the size, type (fish types: Black Bass, Brown Trout, Rainbow Trout, and Pike), quantity of fish, and obstacles vary depending on where the player is on the lake. Once the ideal location is selected, the player casts out the lure using a power meter and then slowly reels it back in. The player must try to attract the interested fish by wiggling the lure in the water and if the fish grabs the lure the player must reel the fish back in making sure that the line does not snap as well as avoiding any obstacles in the way.</p>\n<p>To help the player is the fact that there are many lures to choose from (more are unlocked as the player progresses though the game) as well as a guide that tells the player how good the currently selected location is. The player has one day in game time to catch the biggest Black Bass they can find, as at the end of the day the average weight of you caught Black Bass improves or reduces the players rating as well as their overall position. The player's rating determines how much progress in the tournament is made. Getting further in the tournament, unlocks new lakes (lakes: Lake Amada, Japan Lake, Lake More, San Lake).</p>",

        "description": "<p>Bo Jackson was the first all-star athlete in two major sports, Baseball and American Football. <em>Bo Jackson Baseball</em> is a game about Bo Jackson baseball career. This game plays lake a standard baseball nine (or 5 \u2013 8 if you wish) innings baseball game. There are three difficulty levels giving access to players at all still levels. When pitching you are given 5 different pitch types that pitcher chooses by pressing the correct directional button before the pitch, therefore keeping it hidden from your opponent. Batting is done the same way but the type of hit is chosen as the batter hits the ball.</p>\n<p>At any moment, base sneaking can be made (by the batter) or stopped (by the pitcher). Fielding is only done using the CPU, but once the fielder gets the ball then you must choose what base to throw to using the directional buttons. All of the teams are just city names and players, all with different stats, are fictional except for Bo Jackson himself who is hidden in the game.</p>",

A rumor began to spread that the gang was going to commit a train robbery so the town's sheriff went out to investigate and was never heard from again. Seeking vengeance, the sheriff's son named Sam went out to fight the Scorpions, but was ambushed by some of the gang and was almost killed. Sam was luckily saved by an Indian Warrior named Little Chief. After Little Chief seen Sam's courage, he vowed to help Sam bring the Scorpions to justice. Sam became the new Sheriff in town and chose Little Chief as his deputy.</p>\n<p>In this game you play the role of Sheriff Sam, a young gunslinger who travels the land fighting baddies and playing mini games. The main game play involves you moving around the towns horizontally collecting gold by hitting chest whilst at the same time killing the bad guys before they kill you. There is also an RPG element to it where you have to visit people in the towns in order to proceed like at the very beginning where you need to first acquire a knife and you are then able to smash the chest and get money in order to buy a key which in turn allows you to enter the Sheriffs building. Once you are made sheriff you can go to various towns hunting down an outlaw for the bounty money. There are also mini-games such as the shooting range where you have to shoot the bad guy targets whilst avoiding shooting the innocent bystander targets.</p>",

The sports are divided up into programs that have 2 or 3 different sports each as well as a Special Event, the Marathon. Most of the sports involve pressing A and B buttons quickly or rhythmically, and getting the correct timing to do the needed action.</p>\n<p>The Programs and there included sports are as follows:  </p>\n<p><strong>Program 1:</strong>   </p>\n<p><strong>100-Meter Dash</strong> - Run to the finish as fast as possible.   </p>\n<p><strong>Long Jump</strong> - Run and jump as close to the line as possible and get the right angle. Jump too late and the long jumper will get a foul.   </p>\n<p><strong>100-Meter Backstroke</strong> - Get into the correct rhythm. Unlike the other swim styles, there is no need to take breaths.   </p>\n<p><strong>Special Program:</strong>   </p>\n<p><strong>Marathon</strong> \u2013 This event is split up into five parts. In each of the parts the player is given a map with opponent locations and upcoming hills, the distance from the finish line, and the runners condition. From that information, the player must pick the right speed for there runner to run at. If the runner is too quick he will run out of energy and walk the rest of the leg at 4km/h. After each program the player gets the opportunity to adjust the speed of there runner</p>\n<p><strong>Program 2:</strong>  </p>\n<p><strong>200-Meter Dash</strong> - Run to the finish as fast as possible keeping an eye on the runners energy. If runner runs out of energy the runner will stop until he gets it back.   </p>\n<p><strong>Shot Put</strong> - Build up power and throw the shot put as close to the line as possible at the right angle.   </p>\n<p><strong>100-Meter Butterfly</strong>.

If runner runs out of energy the runner will stop until he gets it back. Harder then the 200 - Meter as the runner needs to conserve more energy.   </p>\n<p><strong>Triple Jump</strong> - Run and jump as close to the line as possible. Time and get the right angle for all three jumps.   </p>\n<p><strong>100-Meter Freestyle</strong> - Get into the correct rhythm and take breaths.

To bowl the player first picks the location that the bower will bowl from and then, using the \u2018Control\u2019 panel, the player must time it correctly to stop the ball at the desired angle and finally, time it correctly to stop the \u2018Power\u2019 bar at the desired power. The power, and the weight of the ball determine how much effect the control has. Up to four players can play using the NES Four Score accessory with all players taking turns to bowl.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Despite what the name implies, <em>Wacky Races</em> for NES is not a racing game, and has nothing to do with the other games bearing the same name but the license. In this game, the player takes control of Muttley, the grumbling, but loyal dog from the popular Hanna-Barbera cartoon. His master Dastardly sends his on three different missions, each taking place in a different location, which in its turn is divided into smaller levels. </p>\n<p>Muttley has to complete those levels in a rather standard platformer fashion, moving from left to right, jumping, overcoming obstacles and fighting various creatures and boss enemies from the cartoon movie. The dog's primary weapon is, unsurprisingly, his own mouth - biting regular enemies will usually lead to their instant death. Muttley can also collect bones scattered across the levels, which will grant him powerful weapons and skills of limited use, such as a bomb, a projectile attack, and the ability to heal.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dance Aerobics</em> is a chance to get fit by following the movements of an aerobics instructor.</p>\n<p>Players use side B of the Power Pad accessory (a floor mat with 12 pads in a 4 by 3 grid) to follow the movements of an aerobics instructor. To succeed the player must press the pads with there feet and hands at the same time as the on screen aerobics instructor. Any missed movements are recorded on a mistake counter and 10 missed movements will fail the level. The routines (a set of repeated movements) start slow and simple with a bit of no-penalty practise time however as the player gets better the routines get more complex with less practices time. Each level has a set number of routines that increase with each level from 4 at the start to a total of 32 on the final level (level 7). At the successful completion of each level the player will get a pass stamp which they can enter later to skip that level.</p>\n<p>The second mode is mini-games called Pad Antics that includes Tune Up, Mat Melodies, and Ditto. Tune Up is where the 10 of the 12 pads (the centre 2 been where the player stands) makes a musical note (do, re, me etc.). Mat Melodies is like Tune Up but the player is given a song to play and the player must memorise to play the notes as they come as every missed note loses points, get over 80 points (from starting at 100) and progress to a harder song. Ditto is like a one-player twister like game where the objective is to place you hands and feet where indicated on the mat on the screen with 1 or 2 points scored with every successful position.</p>\n<p>The third mode is Aerobics Studios. Aerobics Studios is the same as the main game but with only 4 levels (Studio 5, Studio 10, Studio 15, and Studio 20) all unlocked at the start, a score that counts down from 100 with mistakes (or up if the player is doing well), no progression in levels, and the player can continue playing even if there score is at 0.</p>",

The one caveat is that your dude has to match the color of the jewel he or she is trying to collect. To become the correct color to snatch up the jewels, you have to bounce across a paint can (an attitude converter) that will change your dude to that of the same color as the paint can. The object in each puzzle is to retrieve all the treasures in a room without their character falling prey to the various enemies in rooms or running out of time. This is an unlicensed game.</p>",

Ren, who is always on the lookout to get rich, eagerly gets to playing with the video game system on the quest to earn big bucks. </p>\n<p>In the game, you control Ren and Stimpy through various side scrolling levels which are based on different episodes of the cartoon show. Episodes the levels are based on are Space Madness, Out West, and Robin H\u00f6ek. </p>\n<p>In Space Madness, Space Cadet Stimpy must get a dazed Ren to the sick bay to feed him some chicken soup to cure him of his space madness. You will guide Ren through the Space Diner, the Laboratory, the Button Room and the Zero Gravity Bathroom to get to the sick bay. There are also parts of this level in which you will control the spacecraft that involves side scrolling shoot em up gameplay.</p>\n<p>Out West pits Three-Fingered H\u00f6ek and Stimpy the Kid, in the role of horse thieves. You must guide the buckeroos through the outskirts of town, past the corrals, through the rusty frontier town and to the stables, where you'll find the sheriff's horse to steal.</p>\n<p>During Robin H\u00f6ek, Ren is the finest archer in all of Logwood Forest. Armed with a trusty bow and a turkey baster, you must make your way through the village and rescue the fair Maid Moron from the clutches of the evil sheriff, who is holding the maiden captive in his castle.</p>",

The game provides eight colorful opponents to race against, each of whom is supposed to have distinct advantages in a race. Each race begins from a side-scrolling perspective as the 2 competitors speed out of the gate. After a certain distance, the perspective shifts to third person and the driver in the lead occupies the top half of the screen while the driver in second is relegated to half of the lower screen. Occasionally, the game also employs an overhead view. To add to the challenge, the game's cars have 6-speed manual transmissions which players must shift using the control pad, but not while pressing the gas button.</p>",

Two human players can compete head to head, or a computer can control the second player, as the kids race dirt bikes through increasingly difficult obstacle courses whilst collecting power-ups. The dirt bikes can jump and lean and the player needs to take advantage of the bike's abilities in order to avoid being thrown clear.</p>",

Throwing a dart depends on four different factors: position, curve, angle and power. The game allows up to four players to compete against one another.</p>\n<p>In the 301, 501, and 701 games the point is to get the score down to exactly zero.\nIn Count up, the players compete to see who can achieve the highest score.\nIn Round the Clock, players must try to hit the numbers one  through twelve in sequential order.\nIn Half It, players begin with 40 points. Players have three chances to hit the assigned numbers to add to their own score. If the player is unable to hit all assigned numbers, their point total will be cut in half. The player with the highest score wins. The assigned numbers are 16, double ring, 17, 18,triple ring, 19, 20 and the bullseye.</p>",

You can choose between different difficulty levels. They affect the time you have to complete the stages. For difficulty level 1 you get 300 game time, difficulty level 2 gives you 250, and difficulty level 3 only 200.</p>\n<p>Items you can shoot during the game include an hourglass which extends time by 50, an E which gives you 100 points + 1 Energy bar, an E in a white square which gives you 100 points + 2 Energy bars, a Reverse E which gives you 1 Energy bar and C or W symbol which both give only 100 points each. Each disc you shoot above an enemy is worth between 100-500 points.</p>\n<p>The game contains three stages that involve a western, ghost house, and a space theme. There is also a bonus stage where you try to shoot as many bottles as possible. In the party game mode, you compete to have the highest score.</p>",

The only way to lose in the game is to touch the incorrect numbers (numbers other than the one you are required to find) which will drain your life bar. There are also two bonus levels that involve using counting and addition/subtraction skills.</p>",

        "description": "<p>John Rambo is a Special Forces soldier that is currently spending time in military prison, until Colonel Trautman decides that Rambo is the ideal soldier to be sent on a special mission. Rambo's mission is simple, go to Vietnam and photograph the POW camp there. He is also ordered not to engage the enemy or rescue any POW\u2019s. In Vietnam, Rambo meets his contact, Co, and she sets up the passage to the POW camp. During the mission, Rambo cannot bear just photographing the camp when he has an ample opportunity to rescue one of the prisoners. He decides to disobey orders and go for the rescue, which is when it all starts to go wrong.</p>\n<p><em>Rambo</em> is a side scrolling platform game where the player controls Rambo in his mission to Vietnam. The game starts at the military base before getting sent to Vietnam. Once there, Rambo has to fight animals in the jungles, swamps, and caves like wasps, snakes, fish, tigers, bats, spiders, birds, apes and flamingos. Before making his way to the POW camp, he has to fight guards and mercenaries that can kick and shoot him, all wearing differently colored shirts depending on how powerful they are. The game also requires the player to navigate a complex map where the player has to find North and South points on the ground to go up and down levels as well as East and West by moving Rambo to the edge of the screen. There are 6 different weapons that Rambo can pick up: a knife, a throwing knife, a bow with arrows, a bow with exploding arrows, a gun, and a hand grenade. All the weapons but the knife has limited ammo which is collected from killed enemies. There are also health vials that restore health, as well as mission specific items that Rambo must find to complete some missions. The game uses password saves that can be retrieved when talking to other characters.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This game was made with the intentions of helping the player improve their golf game. You can practice setting up putts, dealing with wind resistance, choosing a strike point on the golf ball, and other technical aspects of golfing in the two training modes the game offers. Once you feel you have enough experience you can enter the Golf Grand Slam, a tournament against 29 other fictitious pro players.</p>\n<p>The game features 4 sets of 14 different golf clubs that you can bring to the course. The golfing is done by lining up a cursor to where you want the ball to land and then choosing the proper golf club, stance, and grip. The last step before taking the swing is finding the correct contact point on the golf ball. The contact point is represented as a dot that scatters around on top of a golf ball icon and you have to try to stop it on the part of the ball where you want your club to make contact with the ball.</p>",

From your overhead view, you must use your directional pad to move your character around the grid and push the onscreen obstacles into your enemies to destroy them for the keys to escape as well as other goodies (extra time, bonus points, etc.), but keep in mind that you'll need to use those same obstacles to construct a path to the exit. And don't forget to work fast either, as you only have 100 seconds to clear each puzzle. Fail and you'll lose a life (you start with only three).</p>\n<p>This game may be played with either one or two players (simultaneous play). Player One controls the boy. Player Two gets to be the girl. Both must have their wits about them to make it past the hoards of springs, crazy rollers, witches, zombies, and more to make it home in one piece.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The second <em>Super Robot War</em> is the first canonical episode, where all the basic fundaments of the story and system are set for the rest of the series.</p>\n<p>The story begins when a magnificent scientist discovers that Earth is being threatened, and he decides to construct the world's mightiest robot in order to combat the threat. In order to support his plan, he sets up a secret organisation called Divine Crusaders (D.C.), which embarks on a conquest of the entire planet. Only a few heroic robot pilots from popular animated TV series stand in the way of D.C.</p>\n<p><em>SRW 2</em> is a turn-based strategy game played on a map. What sets it apart from typical war games is the fact that each of your unit is unique, with a unique personality and traits which directly control the outcome of the story. The story is told through scripted events in the scenario and through dialogue between and during battles. This makes the game as much an RPG game as a strategy game. All battles are illustrated using small animated sequences with the robots drawn in a cutesy \u201dsuper-deformed\u201d style.</p>\n<p>Each side takes turn in the game to move units and fight. Each unit has a different movement value, altered by the terrain it is moving in (unless the unit is airbourne). When a unit is moved within range of an enemy, it can usually attack, though certain attacks are not available directly after moving. Weapons vary in usefulness against airbourne, ground-based or submarine units, and also have varying levels of accuracy, which is weighed against the reaction time of the target. Each unit has two different weapons, usually a remote weapon such as a gun and a hand-to-hand combat weapon such as fists or swords. Certain units trade a weapon for the ability to repair others. Another special unit is White Base, the flying carrier. Robots may enter the carrier to be carried over larger distances while being repaired at the same time and launched directly into a confrontation. White Base is both heavily armoured and in possession of weapons with a long range.</p>\n<p>The most apparent difference between Dai-2-ji Super Robot Taisen and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/33598/super-robot-taisen/\">its forerunner</a> is that the robots themselves are not sentient, instead their pilots are in charge. This opens up for a long narrative with the different personality types discussing the events they experience. The spiritual power system, while already introduced in the first game, is now available to all pilots. The spiritual commands allow pilots to upgrade their dodging, accuracy, movement or health during one turn, or even to repair other units. Instead of attacking, units can also try to negotiate with the enemy in order to get him or her to change sides. This command is mostly useful to those who have seen the original TV series and therefore know who are \u201dsupposed to\u201d switch sides.</p>\n<p>For the first time, <em>SRW 2</em> features Winkey Soft's original characters, from the <em>Lord of Elemental</em> universe, in addition to those licenced from Gundam (0079, Z, ZZ, F91), Mazinger (Z, Great Mazinger, Grendizer) and Getter Robo (G).</p>",

In Backwoods, you'll be given different obstacles to contend with and you'll have to find away to get around them.</p>\n<p>You also earn points by executing various stunts along the way. Stunts you can pull off are a toe grab, hand-plant, mid-air 360, and a mule-kick.</p>\n<p>There are three different peaks, each featuring a couple different runs.

One thing led to another and the next thing you know, he's in a Parisian zoo. He makes a break for it and vows to make his way back home to Africa, traveling through Paris, Switzerland, and Egypt in order to reach his destination. This game is a side-scrolling action game. Offensively, C.J. can toss bombs at myriad enemies in his path. He also has a parachute that allows him to glide safely down from great heights. 2 players can play this game cooperatively as 2 differently colored C.J. characters.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Stunt Buggies</em>: this game involves 1 or 2 players piloting buggies around dangerous mazes filled with renegade buggies on a quest to collect all the bombs in order to escape the maze.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>F-16 Renegade</em>: your crazy professor has hacked into the US Air Force's computers and programmed all of the jets to fly off and start World War III. Since no one will believe your tale on this matter, you take it upon yourself to follow your professor's footsteps: you hack into the USAF computers yourself but to locate the F-16 training program so that you can then break into the air base and heist a jet in order to take down all of the malevolent computer-controlled jets. The action in this game consists of flying a jet and shooting other jets. However, the perspective alternates from overhead scrolling (odd levels) to 3rd person view from behind the jet (even levels). Powerups come in the form of stronger weapons, smart bombs, and extra lives. The game also features a 2-player competitive mode.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Go! Dizzy Go!</em>: Dizzy's nemesis, the evil wizard Zaks, has abducted Dizzy's friends. Thus, the task falls to Dizzy to rescue them. To do this, he must collect fruit in a variety of dangerous mazes scattered throughout several worlds including an underwater realm, forest realm, a pyramid, a mountain, and a castle. Additionally, 2 players can team up to conquer the mazes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of the games feature 2-player modes. This is an unlicensed NES game.</p>",

The game has 27 NBA teams with a roster of 324 Players. Each player has a rating for his shooting ability, stamina, jumping power, running speed, stealing ability, and blocking ability. The game allows for pre-season and season modes. In the season modes the game tracks team &amp; player statistics throughout the season.</p>\n<p>You can choose between four modes of play: Manual, which enables you to control an individual team; Coach, which turns the play calling (but not the actual playing) over to you; Computer, which gives all the controls to the computer; and Skip, where the results of a computer-played game are posted, without the game ever having taken place. The game also allows you to set the quarter's time from two minutes to 12 minutes.</p>",

His name is the Lone Ranger. The outlaw, whose name is Butch Cavendish, has now kidnapped the President. The time has come for the masked man to begin his journey of adventure for the purpose of safely rescuing the President and avenging the deaths of his brother and former comrades.</p>\n<p>The game takes you through eight western-themed regions, each \nwith a different objective, all of which brings you closer to your nemesis, Butch Cavendish. The game features many points of view during gameplay. Most of the time, the game is played from a top-down perspective, as you travel through the country and walk through towns. At other times, the game switches to a side scrolling view when you are in a boss stage. On occasion, the view switches to a first person perspective and plays similar to a first person shooter.</p>\n<p>Each bad guy you kill is worth money. You can use money to buy more bullets, dynamite, rifles or a patch up from a doctor. For example, you start with a short barreled gun which you can upgrade to either a medium or long barreled gun. Your gun shoots standard bullets but can also fire silver bullets which are stronger than the standard ones.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Launch Director has assigned a Commander to take control of several NASA Space Launches to do some necessary jobs in space. It is the commander\u2019s job to do all the pre-launch activities like fuelling the space ship and making sure all the crew are on safely and making sure all the post-launch activities are carried out like the rocket and fuel tank separation as well as the successful landing of the shuttle. The commander is also responsible for the extravehicular activities in space such as launching a satellite and building a space station.</p>\n<p><em>Space Shuttle Project</em> simulates a Space Shuttle mission from pre-launch to landing. After writing in a name, the player is presented with a mini game that requires the player to memorise numbers and a space shuttle name to get pass security. After security the space shuttle project is split into four different stages each with there own challenges as follows:<em> </em><em>Stage 1 - Fuel and Board Shuttle:</em>* This stage requires the commander to use the lift to turn the oxygen and hydrogen switches on and open the shuttle doors. Then the commander must move down and up the lift picking up the crew needed for the mission (increases as the levels get harder) while avoiding sliders that cross in lift\u2019s path. This task has to be done within the time limit.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Stage 2 - Space Shuttle Launch:</strong> This stage requires the commander to control the space shuttle into orbit while disconnecting the rocket boasters (SRB) and the external tank (ET). All this is controlled by playing two mini-games that require the player to ether stop the power bar at the correct point or by moving the bottom arrow left and right to match the movements of the top arrow. A third mini-game is added later that requires the player to memorize the correct combination</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Stage 3 - Extravehicular Activities:</strong> The activities that are competed in space vary depending on the mission. Mission 1 requires the commander to release a satellite into space navigating it to avoid all the other moving satellites that are littered though space. Missions 2, 4, and 6 requires the commander to build a part of a space station by grabbing a block from the shuttle and moving it into the correct part of the space station while avoiding satellites and making sure the oxygen levels don\u2019t run out. Mission 3 requires to move and from a damaged satellite avoiding space rocks and repair it. Mission 5 is like mission 3 but to rescue a stranded Soviet cosmonaut.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Stage 4 - Reenter Atmosphere and Land:</strong>This stage requires the commander to control the ship into reentry and land the space shuttle on a landing strip. The mini-games are the same as the space shuttle launch expect the D-pad is used for stopping the power bar.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are 6 different missions with each mission a being more difficult than the last and only five fails allowed before the whole mission fails. Password save is available by adding the supplied password numbers and space shuttle name instead of the memorized numbers at the security check.</p>",

As a Thunderbird, you'll  fly 5 different futuristic aircraft such as a Mach 20 Thunderbird 1 Rocket, the Neptune Hydro-Turbojet, and the Fire Flash Atomic plane. Each vehicle can only take 3 hits before being grounded. If your vehicle is grounded, it will take 3 days to be repaired. These 3 days will be subtracted from your overall 60 days you have to beat the entire game. </p>\n<p>Your enemies consists of such exotic fare as poisonous space scorpions, mutant sea worms and even environmental adversaries such as fire spitting volcanoes. By defeating certain enemies, you aircraft can gain powerups such as replenishing delpleted heath, increased firepower, or adding orbital ships to fly by the side of your main ship to assist you in combat.</p>",

The player tries to create either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines of 3 to 5 identical or consecutive numbers to score points and eliminate them from the well. Each level has a goal that must be met in order to move on to the next level. Goals involve completing a set number of horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines, scoring a stated number of points, or eliminating a certain number of blocks at once by using any combination of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines. There are also treasure blocks which act as wild cards and death blocks which can only be eliminated by combining them with other death blocks.</p>\n<p>The HES version of this game does away with Pyramid and Double Strike and adds the following games in their place:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/31952/blackjack/\">BlackJack</a>* <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/27377/death-race/\">Death Race</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This game is unlicensed.</p>",

The difference this time is that instead of fighting from the cockpit of your Vic-Viper starfighter you'll now be taking the commander's chair and take strategic control of your entire fleet.</p>\n<p>The game is a turn-based strategy game in which you must first assemble your armada and then take them into outer space to defeat the enemy fleet. You view the action from a top-down galactic map and success in each phase rewards you with further cash which you can use to buy more ships. The game will continue until the enemy fleet is obliterated (or yours).</p>\n<p>The game doesn't include a campaign, but instead provides you with a scenario designer from which you select the AI difficulty, which side you will take (you can play as either the Gradius empire or the Bacterions) the map you'll play and away you go.

        "description": "<p>Dr. Evil has kidnapped the scientist Jenny Aykroyd and it's the Ultimate Stuntman's job to rescue her.</p>\n<p>Ultimate Stuntman must fight through 7 worlds with 4 stages each and then through the final world which consists of 3 stages. The game has a variety of different gameplay types. The stages go in the order of an overhead view stage, a side-scrolling stage, a climbing stage with the Android boss, and then a bomb disposal stage.</p>\n<p>The overhead view stages deal with you driving either a car, boat, glider, or a dune buggy and trying to get to the end before time runs out on the clock. You must do this while either dodging or shooting enemies. In all the stages besides the one where you're given a glider you can use a limited number of turbo boosts to speed up your vehicle. In the glider stages you can alter your altitude to either go high above or below various obstacles. All of these levels end with a boss battle.</p>\n<p>Sometimes after these stages there is a bonus round where you try to collect extras in a limited amount of time without crashing into any obstacles. Completing this successfully will yield an extra life.</p>\n<p>The side-scrolling stages consists of two different experiences. One is a platformer where you walk around and can shoot enemies while searching for a set number of keys to unlock a forcefield at the end of the stage. The other consists of you flying a glider throughout a stage shooting enemies and trying not to crash until you get to the end of the stage.</p>\n<p>The climbing stages consist of you climbing a building and shooting enemies with a reticle that you can move all over the screen.You have to get to the top of the building before time runs out. Once at the top you will have to fight an android boss. Such as Mega Slug, Techno Beast, and the Sand Yeti. The android boss fights take place on the buildings rooftops with a side view of the action. The player must drain the energy from the androids by repeated shooting bullets into them.</p>\n<p>In the bomb disposal stage you must dispose of a bomb before the fuse burns all the way detonating it. You dispose the bomb by unsoldering chips away from each other. The player must use the directional pad to move the cursor from chip to chip keeping an eye on the number on each one. Every time the cursor moves to a certain block, the number on it decreases by one. This creates a puzzle-like scenario, where if the player makes a mistake he must reset the disposal and try again with less time.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Samantha and Norbert, two teenage troll twins, were windsurfing one day and came upon an undiscovered and uncharted island. They recalled that once long ago their grandfather had told them of an island that contained lost treasures. So the twin trolls decide to explore the island to see if they can obtain these treasures.</p>\n<p><em>Trolls on Treasure Island</em> involves the same type of gameplay found in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/33166/dudes-with-attitude/\">Dudes with Attitude</a>. In this puzzle game, the player controls one of the trolls as they bounce back and forth across the screen trying to acquire the jewels on the playfield. The one caveat is that the players troll has to match the color of the jewel he or she is trying to collect. To become the correct color to snatch up the jewels, the player has to bounce across a paint can that will change your trolls hair to that of the same color as the paint can. The object in each puzzle is to retrieve all the treasures in a room without their character falling prey to the various enemies in rooms or running out of time.</p>\n<p>The game offers 32 levels to navigate through and the player is also able to create their own level with the custom level editor.</p>\n<p>This is an unlicensed NES game.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the board game, the object is to guess either a word or phrase based on a drawing. Each team starts on the same square on the board and the first team attempts to draw a picture based on a clue.  If his team correctly guesses the clue, then this team gets to roll the dice and advance along the board.  If the team fails to guess correctly, then the other team gets a chance to draw and guess. The game plays much in this way until a team reaches the final square on the board and successfully guesses the clue to win the game.</p>\n<p>This game contains three different modes; regular game, alternative game, and drawing practice. It also allows for up to four teams which can be made comprising of any number of players per each team. </p>\n<p>In the regular game, a team will be given a turn to start revealing pieces of one of the 500+ drawings that are hidden in the game. Each drawing is a 6x8 size and has 48 pieces to it. To reveal the pieces, the player is made to play one of four timed minigames which are chosen depending on the color of the square the player landed on the board. The minigames consist of Attack of the Paint Zombies, The WareHouse Shuffle, Leapin' Energy Capsules!, and Four Alarm Rescue. In Attack of the Paint Zombies the player fires downwards at the aliens and the more aliens that are hit the more pieces that are revealed of the drawing. If the aliens hit the player, the player loses time off the clock. In The WareHouse Shuffle, the player goes all the way to the left side and then stacks as many boxes on top of each other that they can bring over all the way to the right side. While transporting the boxes, their are two enemies who can hit into your boxes thus subtracting them from the haul and also taking time away. Each box brought over reduces a piece of the hidden drawing. In  Leapin' Energy Capsules!, the player is an astronaut and is moving and jumping to collect blue spheres. While collecting the spheres the player must try to avoid hitting any enemies which will reduce time. Each sphere collected clears up another piece of the drawing. In Four Alarm Rescue, the player controls a pair of firemen on the ground with a net who are moving back and forth catching the jumping people above on the net. Each person rescued leads a revealed piece of the drawing while each person not rescued leads to reduced time.</p>\n<p>The alternative game allows the player to draw the picture for other players to guess, so their are no minigames in this mode. Other than that, it is the same as the regular mode.</p>\n<p>Drawing practice lets the player practice their drawing technique without the pressure of a timer.</p>",

Most of the game involves controlling Thrilla on a skateboard, dodging or jumping over various obstacles and enemies while attempting to get to the end of the stage. There will also be times when Thrilla will get to be on a surfboard, but gameplay remains the same as it was on the skateboard. Thrilla also rides a shark underwater with the goal still being to get to the end of the stage while either dodging enemies or throwing spears at them. There are also boss battles where Thrilla throws either coconuts or spears trying to deplete all the health of his adversary. </p>\n<p>There is also a shell game between stages which allows the player to obtain extra lives. The game also contains powerups throughout its levels such as a banana which restores health.</p>",

Now it's up to Slick and Spin to go and rescue the kidnapped crash dummies.</p>\n<p>In The Incredible Crash Dummies the player alternates between Slick and Spin as they go through five levels with each level containing 2 stages (except for the 4th level which only consists of one). One of the Dummies' legs has been replaced with a wheel while the other Dummy has his legs intact. So the main difference in gameplay is that in some stages the player either rolls throughout it or walks throughout it. The Dummies' arsenal includes an air gun which stuns enemies at close range and an oil gun which shoots and kills enemies at a far range. There are also a few powerups scattered throughout the stages such as the arrow, balloon, and arm powerup.</p>",

There is also an opportunity for the player to design their own golf course. The game features variable weather conditions like showers, downpours, wind, and sunshine. The game allows for both strokeplay and matchplay. It also allows for three difficulty levels: novice, amateur, and professional. Practice mode lets the player train on the putting green or on a practice hole.</p>\n<p>Gameplay consists of aiming the golf ball and then swinging the chosen golf club. Swinging is done by a meter which measures the power of the shot and determines whether the ball gets hit straight, hooks, or slices. Putting is done with an overhead view on the green with the meter being used to measure the amount of power that is put on a putt.</p>",

Now it's time for the pilot of the RH119 to fend off the Molok Wardrivers and save the CosmoStation.</p>\n<p><em>Star Voyager</em>'s gameplay requires the player to venture through various sectors of the galaxy in search of different alien fleets so they can be defeated. Fuel stations are placed around sporadically and help if fuel is running low. There are several different planets that are either empty or have people that can upgrade the player's equipment to fight off the enemy fleets. These upgrades include the super laser, improved shields, and engines that enhance the ship's warping ability. Warping is a vital part of the gameplay. If players do not warp to different sectors wisely, they might end up lost, run into dangerous sectors such as the black hole or the asteroid field, or run out of fuel. The game ends if enemy ships destroy the CosmoStation Noah.</p>",

The player controls a block in the center of the screen which can move and rotate freely. Larger blocks move inward from each side of the screen and attach to the center block, then change color depending on their distance from the center. If the player completes a colored ring, that layer and all the blocks inside of it are cleared, and all the ones outside are moved inward. Play ends if a newly-appearing block overlaps with the player's structure.</p>",

But Cubby and Rubby have two skills their ancestors did not: by holding down the attack button, they can float upwards - and by releasing it, they'll fire several bubbles at once. They can also pick up special items that increase their points, speed and attack power. This game features 80 levels, all-new enemies, and bonus mini-games.</p>",

You play as Lolo, a blue ball-like character with eyes, arms, and legs. The story mainly deals with King Egger, the villain, who has captured princess Lala, who is similar to Lolo, only she is red.</p>\n<p>Again it's up to Lolo to rescue Lala by travelling through Egger's domain and solving the puzzle rooms laid out before him. You must guide Lolo through a room of tiles and collect all of the Heart Framers in the room. Doing this opens up a Jewel Box, which contains an item. Successfully acquiring the contents of the Jewel Box will clear the room of all monsters and open the way to the next room(s). All the rooms are connected but not all the room entrances or exits are closed.</p>\n<p>To fight the monsters Lolo has a weapon: the Magic Shot. Two shots can be obtained by collecting certain Heart Framers.</p>\n<p>There are numerous types of obstacles in the rooms. Emerald Framers are green blocks that Lolo may push around freely. To make it all more challenging there are also numerous terrain obstacles, like water, sand and grass which have all different drawbacks for Lolo.</p>",

It is based upon the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/308273/jim-henson/\">Jim Henson</a> film of the same name incorporates many scenes from the movie as areas with the maze.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to collect twelve coins Sara can use to buy back her baby brother from his kidnapper, the goblin king, Jareth. There is one coin in each of the twelve mazes surrounding the central castle. At first only a few of the mazes are accessible; however, upon collecting a section of a broken key, of which there is also one per region, Sara is sent to a hub where a friendly goblin will open up a new area. Each section of the maze has its own gimmick, for instance the Hedge Maze rearranges itself as the player wanders through it, and the Fieries' Forest is filled with teleports. The areas are also connected via a large underground maze. Upon gaining all the sections of the key Sara can open the door to the castle and enter the final series of mazes, however, she cannot win if she has not collected all of the coins.</p>\n<p>Throughout all this Sara is constantly beset by enemies at which she must throw a never-ending supply of stones to dissipate. Her stones can be upgraded eventually and she can also gain the favor of her friends from the movie who will follow her around and try to help her shoot at her aggressors.</p>\n<p>All of this must be done in no more than 13 minutes or the game must be restarted, and every time an enemy attacks Sara she loses a few more seconds. However, there are several ways to gain more time, and part of winning the game is balancing actually solving the maze and spending time searching for minutes to do just that.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Edoropolis is home to a race of Animaloids, anthropomorphic animals which are a combination of flesh and cybernetic body parts. They are ruled by Shogun Tokugawa Lei Lei and his daughter, Tokugawa Usako. Unfortunately for them, the Prime Minister Kitsunezuka Ko'on No Kami is actively trying to depose both of them and wants to assume power by force! He's always got a plan up his sleeves, usually involving attacking the city using an army of Ninja Crows, led by Karamaru and Karasu Gennarisai (who also serves as Ko'on No Kami's advisor).</p>\n<p>It's here where Inuyama Wanko-no-Kami, Chief of the Palace guard, steps in - by bringing in the Secret Ninja Team Nyankii! Whenever Wanko-No-Kami hears that Ko'on No Kami is plotting something, he dispatches the Nyankiis from their secret base at the Pizza Cat Restaurant so they can stop him before he is successful.</p>\n<p>However, there are rumors that a foreign scientist called Dr. Purple is aiding Ko'on No Kami... but for what purpose? What could Ko'on No Kami be planning this time?</p>\n<p><em>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee</em> is a side-scrolling action game in the tradition of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Ninja+Gaiden\">Ninja Gaiden</a>, and it is based off the Japanese TV show produced in 1990 by Tatsunoko Productions and Sotsu agency. There are eleven stages in total, and you can play as any of the three main Secret Ninja Team Nyankii members: <em>Yattaro</em>, leader of the team, who uses his Cat's Eye Sword as his main weapon; <em>Pururun</em>, the only female on the team, who attacks with projectiles and her razor-sharp nails; and <em>Sukashii</em>, who uses an umbrella to dispatch his enemies.</p>\n<p>By pausing the game, you can switch out and change places with one of the four Rescue Team members in order to use their special abilities: <em>Rikinoshin</em> can break boulders, <em>Mietoru</em> can fly for a limited time, <em>Gotton</em> can drill through certain walls, and <em>Nekkii</em> can swim easily and use water attacks. You can only use their abilities for a limited amount of time, which can be recovered by picking up items with a cat paw printed on it.</p>\n<p>All seven playable characters have an upgradable special move, which can be used by pressing Up + B. Each move is more devastating than the last, but can only be used a certain amount of times, until the Ninpo bar is drained.</p>",

Next to brawling action, it also features two sections where the player controls the Batmobile and the Batskiboat seen in the movie.</p>\n<p>In the beat 'em up sections, Batman has to defeat a large number of enemies (members of the Penguin's circus gang) to advance. Possible attacks include punches, sliding attacks, drop kicks and a powerful 360\u00b0 cape slash attack which will drain Batman's health bar. Gadgets to be used include a limited number of batarangs and a grappling hook. The hook is useful for many things: it can take down flying enemies, pull Batman up to higher levels, lets him climb into open windows and more. Hidden in background items somewhere in the levels are power-ups, including hearts that refill the health bar and extra batarangs.</p>\n<p>Each of the six levels in the game concludes with a boss fight against one or more especially powerful enemies.</p>\n<p>The Batmobile is armed with machine guns and bat discs, used to dispatch the enemy bikes and cars in the driving level. The Batskiboat section is similar, except that there are no enemies and the only goal is to collect coins for extra points.</p>",

She must not only defend herself against hordes of aliens and find the exit, but also save a number of prisoners, all within a tight time limit of only minutes per level.</p>\n<p>Weapons to use against the aliens include a pulse rifle, flame thrower, grenade launcher as well as hand grenades. Ammo for each is limited and must be collected in the levels. The rifle is prone to overheating, so should only be fired in short bursts.</p>\n<p>Next to health packs, Ripley can also find a radar. The radar indicates both moving aliens as well as the locations of prisoners.</p>\n<p>After every two levels, a guardian level follows, in which an especially tough alien must be defeated to continue.</p>",

Your planet being attacked by an invading alien armada tends to change that sort of thing, though. The young princess of the invading army, Kahm, comes to Earth to take part in the annihilation of the human race. She ends up stranded on Earth, where Tetsuya finds her, and they fall for each other.</p>\n<p>They decide that if they were to get married, the two planets would no longer be able to fight, and so they set off for Kahm's home planet to seek permission from her father, the emperor. Having been the one who ordered the invasion in the first place, though, he is not particularly pleased with this turn of events. Tetsuya is imprisoned, and Kahm is taken away to places unknown. Now, Tetsuya must break out of prison and rescue Kahm!</p>\n<p><em>Outlanders</em> is an action RPG based on the manga by Joji Manabe. Tetsuya, being just a regular guy, isn't a particularly able fighter, and at first is only equipped with a sword, though he can eventually find other weapons including a gun. At the beginning, Tetsuya's only companion is the brown, cloaked alien Nao, who helps him escape the holding cell, but eventually he will find others who will help him. Other standard RPG features are also present: items can be found and stored, and some characters can learn magic. The game uses a password system to save progress.</p>",

His trademark spinning sword now seems to more closely resemble a <em>b\u014d</em>, and Yanchamaru can now use it to shoot waves of energy at foes, bounce on the end, spin in place, and even launch off of walls and corners. Taking a cue from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Mega+Man+3\">Mega Man</a>, he also now has the ability to slide through narrow spaces and underneath dangerous spikes.</p>\n<p>Each stage contains numerous keys and locked doors. Any key will open any door, and it is possible to complete a stage without even finding all the keys and doors. The final door in each stage leads to the boss room. After clearing each stage, your performance is tallied, and depending on what you did, bonuses such as points or lives are given.</p>",

A boy and a girl (who remain unnamed) board their ships to fight off the threat.</p>\n<p>This is a vertical scrolling shoot-em-up game viewed from overhead, where the player pilots a fighter ship through seven levels of intense shooting action. Each level hurls enemies and bullets at the player's ship, ending with a boss fight, except for one which instead is a boss rush level. The game allows for two players to play at the same time.</p>\n<p>The player has a choice of two weapons; bullets or lasers. Weapons can be changed by picking up gems of different colors. Picking up the same color as you already have allows you to upgrade your current weapon a few times. The player's ship can change form and with it the way that the weapons work. This allows the player to pick the best weapon strategy for each situation. The player also has a limited amount of bombs that are useful to get out of tricky situations.</p>\n<p>When a weapon is upgraded it also acts as a shield so the ship can take an enemy bullet without dying. This will however degrade the weapon down to the first level again. There are also pickups that alter the ship's speed and a special gem that, if five of them are collected, temporarily transforms the ship into an invincible super ship.</p>\n<p>Crisis Force was only released in Japan.</p>",

Their owner, Jon, is too lazy to go look for Odie himself, so he has Garfield go out and look for him. And so Garfield heads off, out into the world.</p>\n<p><em>A Week of Garfield</em> is a side-scrolling platform game based on the comic strip by Jim Davis. Garfield heads to the right through various indoor and outdoor city environments, dealing with endless vermin like frogs, birds, and mice using his judo kick skills and several different weapons such as bones that can be thrown. He has a life bar that can quickly deplete if he isn't careful, but hidden all around each stage are various items, which can replenish his health, refill his weapon supplies, and give him super speed or invincibility; be careful, though, as sometimes he'll also find fish bones which will harm Garfield if eaten.</p>\n<p>The game is divided into seven stages, each representing a day of the week, and each with several sections. At the end of each section is a door, and Garfield must find the key hidden somewhere on the screen to unlock the door and continue. At the last door of each stage, there is a boss that must be defeated before Garfield can find the key. Each stage also has a strict time limit to keep him from dawdling, and between stages, Jon will appear to encourage Garfield or give him some advice.</p>",

The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete rows, which disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.</p>\n<p>The game offers two different modes of play, \"Type A\" and \"Type B\". \"Type A\" is a standard endless mode, where the speed of the game increases every ten lines, with an option for the starting level when beginning the game. \"Type B\", on the other hand, is a race to clear 25 lines, with options for both drop speed and starting garbage. In both modes, successful play is rewarded with cute animations. There are also three different background songs to choose from.</p>",

There are, naturally, two variations featured on this cartridge: regular Tetris with several modes, as well as a new game called BomBliss. Also included is a two-player battle version of regular Tetris.</p>\n<p>Tetris mode includes three game types. First is A-Type, which is a standard endless mode that continually increases pace until the player loses. Next is B-Type, which is a race to 25 lines under increasingly tough conditions. Last is C-Type, which is similar to A-Type, but adds a continually-rising stack of garbage appearing from the bottom of the well.</p>\n<p>BomBliss is slightly different from regular Tetris. In each stage, the well is filled with a preset pattern of blocks and bombs. Completing a line will, unlike Tetris, not clear it. It will, however, activate any bombs within the completed line, which can then destroy the blocks. The goal is to clear the entire well of blocks.</p>\n<p>BomBliss also includes three different modes of play. Contest mode tasks the player with clearing out a preset field in as few blocks as possible; the top three scores for each stage are saved. Puzzle mode tasks the player with clearing a preset field with a preset sequence of pieces. Last, there is Construction mode, which allows the player to build their own puzzle stages.</p>",

        "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=LJN\">LJN</a>'s NES version of the classic horror series casts the player as a teen searching the houses on Elm Street for Freddy Krueger's bones. Once they are all collected, they must be thrown into the high school furnace to destroy Freddy once and for all (a plot similar to 1987's <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors</em>).</p>\n<p><em>Nightmare</em> has two worlds. In the red-tinted \"real world,\" players fight snakes and spiders while navigating standard platform challenges. The players here have a \"sleep meter\" that depletes with every hit taken. If the player's sleep meter drops to empty, the game transitions into the blue-tinted \"dream world,\" where enemies take on the appearance of skeletons and ghosts. An invisible timer also starts, counting down until Freddy appears and forces the player into a brief boss battle. The sleep meter becomes a standard life gauge in the dream world, and deducts a life from the player if drained.</p>\n<p>Players can find and collect three different icons in the dream world to become \"Dream Warriors\" with special powers and projectile attacks - both of which give a significant edge when fighting Freddy. Collecting all the bones in a level takes the player to a final level boss, usually taking the form of a monster with Freddy's face or trademark razor glove. Players move back and forth down Elm Street, and a new house opens up as the previous one is cleared.</p>\n<p><em>Nightmare</em> is compatible with the NES Four Score accessory, allowing up to four players to play at once using the same screen.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Fun House</em> is based on a children's television game show of the same name.</p>\n<p>The basic premise of the game is to get through the 72 rooms of the Fun House. The object of each room is to throw tomatoes at the targets littered throughout the room before time expires. Sometimes these targets are numbered, so they have to be hit in numerical order. After all targets are hit, a key will appear allowing the player to move on to the next room. </p>\n<p>This may appear simple, but the player's character is on rollerblades, thus making navigating not such a simple task. There are also blobs, boingers, the banana launcher, and the spray gun which will either try to hinder progress or take away time if the player gets hit by them. The player also has to deal with various terrain obstacles in each room such as slime covered ramps or icy floors.</p>\n<p>The player starts with three lives, but can earn more by collecting 25 silver coins. There are also gold coins with each one equaling 5 silver coins.</p>\n<p>Other helpful items the player can collect are glop clocks, with the small ones adding 8 seconds, and the large ones adding 15 seconds to the game clock. There are also sneakers which will temporarily increase the player's speed. There are also starbursts, which increase the players score and warp cubes, which will send the player to another part of the Fun House.</p>",

However, the girl he wants to marry won't agree to marriage until Happy can prove that he can provide for a family. So now it's up to Happy to collect a small fortune so he can please his would be spouse. Of course, the boss cat Nyamco and his legion of mukies stand in the way of making this an easy endeavor.</p>\n<p>The game is a basic sidescrolling platformer. Happy can defeat his enemies by kicking them. He can also perform a jump, and while he's up in the air, he can spin his tail so he can glide in the air for a short period of time, which is useful for clearing large chasms. Littered throughout the levels are treasure boxes and coins which earn money for Happy, which in turn can be spent on items for domestic living. On the other hand, every time Happy is hit by an enemy, he loses some money, though a money bag will appear allowing Happy to recollect some of the lost money.</p>\n<p>After each stage, Happy is presented with a slot machine ran by Nyamco. First, Happy spins the wheel to see a prize. Prizes range from extra lives to domestic items. Now, to actually win these  prizes, Happy must go up against one of the Mukies in a minigame. If he fails to win the minigame, he can be penalized by losing some money, domestic items, or even a life. Minigames include waving flags by following Nyamco's orders. There's also a  minigame where Happy stands back to back with a mukie and they try to push each other off a platform.  The other minigame involves trying to spot more differences in a picture than the opponent can.</p>\n<p>After the minigame is over, Happy goes to a shop, where he can purchase items for his house. Buying these items will prove to the bride to be that Happy is worth marrying.</p>\n<p>The two player game has both players, (one playing as Happy, the other as his brother Rappy), competing against each other to collect the most assets to prove their worth as a suitable husband.</p>",

The player can race the vehicle on one of three different skill levels. Each skill level contains five different tracks for the player to race on. On each of these tracks, the player must complete 2 laps before a countdown timer expires. The player must also try not to crash into other racers and obstacles on the sides of the road. The vehicle has a manual transmission, so the player has to switch between low and hi gear while racing.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the 1990 Schwarzenegger film of the same name, <em>Total Recall</em> for the NES generally adheres to the movie's plot across its nine levels. Unlike the various PC iterations, this title was created by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/45/interplay-entertainment-corp/\">Interplay</a> and published by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Acclaim+Entertainment,+Ltd.\">Acclaim</a>.</p>\n<p>Players control Doug Quaid as he platform hops across Earth and Mars in search of his stolen memories and the responsible parties. A collection of police, soldiers, and creatures will try to stop him. Quaid's default attack is a strong punch, though guns can be knocked away from some guards and picked up for use. Cutscenes between certain levels tell the movie's plot, and feature likenesses of the actors from the film (including Arnold).</p>\n<p>Sequences in the film are also replicated more tightly than in the PC versions. Quaid will be chased by henchman Richter in the first level, and must battle his wife inside their apartment. The security x-ray scanner takes up a level, as does the subway battle after. The player will also commandeer a Martian taxi for a driving level inside the colony, and windows can be shot out on Mars, sucking out any unfortunate baddies nearby.</p>",

After the events of the film <em>Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure</em>, they seem free to build the band that will one day unite Earth's people and bring about world peace. Except... Rufus returns from the future with a warning that someone has warped the time continuum by kidnapping historical figures and stranding them in the wrong time period (...sooo, basically what Bill and Ted did in the first film?) It's up to the boys to sort out the mess.</p>\n<p>The player controls either Bill or Ted, who have split up to tackle the quest (allowing each to leave items to assist the other). Each \"mission\" begins by consulting a phone book of historical figures, and spotting the page whose number has changed (a second number, flashing in red). The player dials that number, and guides the phone booth through the circuits of time. Rufus could only lend a payphone, so players will need to plot out the shortest path to their destination, while avoiding any hazards. Each change in direction costs one coin.</p>\n<p>Once in the target time period, the player controls Bill or Ted through an isometric view as they search for the displaced historical figure. The player must stick to a defined path to avoid falling, and must be cautious of the locals. Some will offer clues or helpful items, while others demand a coin if bumped into. Other locals will actively chase Bill and Ted and throw them in jail, where they must use a skeleton key (if they have one) to escape. Players can find and collect coins for the phone booth, keys for the jail, and distractions (like pudding or tape players) to throw off any pursuers.</p>\n<p>The player must also locate an item of \"historical bait,\" appropriate to the target, to get them to follow. Once the historical dude has been baited and bagged, the player switches to the other member of the titular duo to rescue a new historical celebrity. The process repeats until time is corrected.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Randy, the Holy Diver, is setting out to retrieve the five emblem seals belonging to the King Crimson Family in order to expel the greatest evil, the Black Slayer, back into another dimension.</p>\n<p><em>Holy Diver</em> is an action game much in the vein of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/2062/castlevania/\">Castlevania</a>. The player controls the Diver as he uses magic powers such as shooting energy balls and freezing time to traverse the game's eight levels. Enemies throughout the levels respawn and there are destroyable objects in your path. At the end of each level a tougher boss character must be beaten. Once defeated a power-up spell becomes available to the player. To use these spells the player must pause the game and select it from the inventory menu. The player has the ability to shoot horizontally as well as up. Difficult paths may sometimes be crossed by the combination of the right spell at the right time such as the freezing spell that freezes quicksand. </p>\n<p>Though scheduled for release in North America, the game never went beyond its release in Japan.</p>",

Information you gather from satellites with your deployable Mechs will help you find the alien force and destroy them. Once deployed your Mechs walk around the surface and fight turrets and find items/clues.</p>\n<p>Your viewscreen is where you target alien space-craft, astronauts, moons, and planets and interact with them. The interactions allowed are:  Missile, Beam, Shiled (sic), Move, Communicate, Computer, Parts, and State. Missile launches a rocket with adjustable strength at your target. Beam shoots a laser weapon at your target. The misspelled Shield function lets you decide if you want your shields on or not. Move button has two different sub selections; Warp and Land. Warp lets you travel from planet to planet while Land lets you deploy one of your Mechs on to the surface of a satellite or enemy cruiser. Communicate lets you do just that, communicate with planets and other vehicles. Computer gives you read-outs on targeted planets and vehicles. The Computer also is where you perform repairs on your ship or Mechs. Parts lets you see what weapons you have loaded. Finally, State, gives you detailed information pertaining to shields, weapons etc of your Cosmo Carrier and three Mechs; Gravity, Blizzard and Field.</p>",

The game is licensed from the television cartoon series of the same name which in turn is based on an older comic series.</p>\n<p>As Valiant the player must find Camelot and go on a quest for King Arthur to become a knight. </p>\n<p>In most levels the player just has to move to the right side of the screen to reach the exit of each level. All the while enemies will spawn and attack Valiant. Aside from humans the game also offers its share of mythical creatures that have to be defeated including dragons. The player must also jump over pit traps and water or face death. The player can be hit multiple time and can regenerate health by finding power-ups. To combat the enemies the player can use Valiant's crossbow which shoots in a straight line.</p>\n<p>There are two special levels with different controls. In one such level the player can only move his targeting reticule in a first-person on rails shooting segment and in the other 6 cannons can be fired The player can select which cannon fires and how far it should shoot. The goal in these levels is to kill all enemies and avoid receiving damage.</p>\n<p>The later US release is completely identical, but loses the <em>Prince Valiant</em> license, instead replacing the protagonist with Lancelot.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This game aims to help younger Japanese speaking children learn some English vocabulary words. The game features Popeye the Sailorman, Bluto, Olive Oyl, and Swee'Pea, plus two locations from the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9378/popeye/\">Popeye</a>. The game modes included are Word Puzzle A, Word Puzzle B, and Word Catcher.</p>\n<p>In Word Puzzle A, players first choose from one of six categories. The categories are animal, country, food, sports, science, and others. Olive Oyl will then select a word of random length from the selected category for Popeye to solve. Popeye solves the hidden word by punching letters, with the correct letters helping fill in the hidden word while incorrect guesses let Bluto knock into a suspended basket which holds Swee'Pea. If too many incorrect guesses are made Swee'Pea falls down and Popeye loses a round to Bluto. If Popeye fills in the word correctly before that happens, Popeye wins the round. Whoever (Popeye or Bluto) wins the most rounds out of ten wins Olive Oyl's love. There is also a question mark symbol, that when hit solves the puzzle automatically but also has the consequence of the player automatically losing that round.</p>\n<p>Word Puzzle B is basically played the same way as Word Puzzle A is, with the exception that in B, the Japanese translation of that word isn't displayed in Katakana like it is in A. So mode B is meant for those who have honed their English to a higher degree. </p>\n<p>Word Catcher is a game mode for two players. Popeye and Bluto are tasked with catching English alphabet letters which are being tossed down from Olive Oyl. They must catch the letters in the correct order, so that they will spell out a translation of one of three Japanese words that are displayed. Each correct word spelled wins the player a round. Whoever wins five rounds first wins Olive Oyl.</p>",

It is a side-scrolling action game where the player has to shoot, kick, jump and duck to overcome a plethora of baddies. Before the player selects a stage, they have to select one of five heroes, each with their own amount of health and weapon type. They also have a limited use special attack that can clear the screen of enemies. At the end of each level the hero jumps inside a giant robot and engages in a one-on-one duel with the boss of that level. </p>\n<p>The game features four difficulty levels (two of which are hidden), a password system, and a \"Battle mode\" in which the player can practice fighting against any of the bosses.</p>",

Most of the character roster is being a huge bunch of shotoclones, with one of the few exceptions being Peach, who has Chun-Li's moveset, Koopa, who has some sort of a 'kamikaze' projectile and Donkey Kong who throws a ground projectile, similar to Terry's Power Wave.</p>\n<p>The game has original sprites and music, although some graphics were obviously reused from such games as Little Nemo: The Dream Master and Wario Land 4, not to say about the use of the graphics from Mario games themselves.</p>\n<p>Like in many games based on the same engine (along with NES Street Fighter II port by the same developers), this has the two-player mode, apart from the contrary belief, by pressing the A button on the second gamepad during player select sequence.</p>",

The Holy Flame Society, the most persistent of rebel organizations, is being heavily persecuted by the government, and its leader, the Grand Master, has disappeared. The player takes control of the \"Little Master\", who must find allies to strengthen the Holy Flame Society and eventually overthrow the rulers of the country.</p>\n<p>Considered the first major Chinese (Taiwanese)-made role-playing game for a console, <em>Sheng Huo Lie Zhuan</em> (\"Tale of the Holy Flame\") is a rather basic RPG of the Japanese template. The player navigates the hero and subsequently joining party members over the top-down \"world map\", entering towns and other areas represented by icons. In towns, it is possible to rest, chat with the townspeople, and buy supplies. Enemies attack the party randomly. The player must choose which characters to use before every battle. The turn-based engine, menu-based command input, and automatic leveling up are handled the same way as Japanese RPGs of the time.</p>",

This version retains most of the dialogue (translated into Chinese) of the original release, and, with a few exceptions, the narrative develops in exactly the same way.</p>\n<p>Naturally, given the much more limited technology of this version's platform, everything else has been changed accordingly. For all purposes, the game looks, sounds, and plays like a Famicom (NES) game. Much of the graphics and sounds have been ripped from other games (usually early <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=final+fantasy\"> Final Fantasy</a> installments).</p>\n<p>The gameplay underwent some significant changes. Many of the monsters are entirely different. The difficulty level is much higher than in the original version. The game still retains the materia system (equipment imbued with magic spells that can grow), but it has been simplified, and the growth is much slower. The characters are unable to execute any \"limit break\" attacks.</p>\n<p>Much of the original game's content has been eliminated, such as all the mini-games, optional locations (there is no town of Wutai), optional characters (no Yuffie and/or Vincent), and optional bosses (no \"weapon\" monsters).</p>",

The cartridge came with a keyboard and required the use of the Famicom Data Recorder in order to save any created programs.</p>\n<p>The cartridge was originally released as Family BASIC, but was later re-released as Family BASIC V3 with added memory. This version also came packaged with some games already included. Games are accessed by typing GAME followed by a space then a number (0, 1, 2, or 3).</p>\n<p>The following are the games that were included:</p>\n<p>GAME 0 is the Heart Game. Using either a microphone or the keyboard, players get to fill in a heart with Mario and Pauline (of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/574/donkey-kong/\">Donkey Kong</a> fame) meeting in the middle for a smooch.</p>\n<p>GAME 1 is the Number Game. Players control a penguin on a grid collecting numbers in sequential order while trying to avoid the Sidesteppers from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7301/mario-bros/\">Mario Bros.</a>.</p>\n<p>GAME 2 is the Mario Game. Players are able to control Mario in game levels that they themselves make.</p>\n<p>GAME 3 is Star Killer. 1 or 2 players control their spaceship trying to shoot as many enemies as they can.</p>",

The players ship can fire bullets at any incoming enemy forces while searching each area for an enemy part. The game contains 30 areas with three different themes in total (a river, a military base, and outer space) and some areas contain branching paths. Some areas also contain a Zystas Warp, which will take the player back to the beginning section of the next area. After finishing area 30, the game loops back to Area 1 until the player enters Area 30 with the 100 enemy parts collected.</p>\n<p>The ship's power-ups include a faster firing rate, side cannons, and longer shots. Other items that can be found can grant the player 10 extra parts, a missile that can be fired to clear the entire screen of enemies, and also an item that can cause the player to lose all the parts they collected if they accidentally destroy it.</p>\n<p>Players start with three lives and can earn extra lives by racking up enough points (first 20,000 points, then every 50,000 additional points thereafter).</p>",

        "description": "<p>This game is an updated version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/19634/warp-warp/\">Warp Warp</a>. Players once again take control of the monster fighter as he does battle with various types of enemy Beroberos.</p>\n<p>The game features two types of gameplay. First, players start out in the Space World. Players control the monster fighter from a top down perspective. The player is equipped with a weapon that can be used to fire at the enemy monsters. The monster fighter can only walk in the four cardinal directions and thus only fire straight forward in whatever direction he is currently facing. The objective is to eliminate all the enemy monsters from the playfield to clear a level. Also, eliminating three monsters of the same type and color in a row, will cause a special monster to appear which can be shot for bonus points. Sometimes these special monsters will carry one letter of the word EXTRA. Collecting all five letters of that word will give the player an extra life.</p>\n<p>In the center of the Space World is a warp tunnel that will occasionally flash when active. Entering an active warp tunnel will lead the player to the Maze World.</p>\n<p>The Maze World portion of the game is similar in nature to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Bomberman\">Bomberman</a>. Players walk along grid based corridors, planting time bombs attempting to eliminate any enemy monsters who happen to have had the misfortune of stumbling upon them.</p>\n<p>Players will have the opportunity to warp out of either world at random intervals. However, they are not required to leave the current world they are in, and they can continue playing in that world type if they so choose to.</p>",

Players have control over their spaceships altitude while flying around the screen and can fire two different weapons. One weapon is meant for ground enemies while the other weapon is meant for aerial enemies. While the majority of the enemies are gun towers, ships and tanks that can be defeated in one shot, at the end of each round players will have to face off with a gigantic boss enemy that will require several shots to defeat.</p>\n<p>Mode B is similar to Mode A, but now the camera follows the players ship's movements instead. This mode also features a fixed target reticle in front of the player's ship to help with aiming their fire.</p>",

Now, it's up to the kitten's mother, Milky, to search all over the town trying to locate the kitten and return it to their household. </p>\n<p>The game is set in a town viewed from a top-down perspective. The player control the mother cat. The mother cat has the ability to jump and to open or close any manhole covers that are close by. While searching for the lost kitten, the mother cat is harassed by enemy dogs that want to harm her. There are other obstacles that the mother cat has to be wary of such as oncoming traffic, snakes, traffic cones, and open manhole covers which she can fall into if she is not careful. </p>\n<p>The mother cat can become temporarily invincible from the dogs by eating a fish from one of the neighborhood markets, although this will cause the merchant to come out of the shop with a knife and give chase to the thieving cat. Another way to slow down the chasing dogs is to open a manhole cover so they fall down into the sewers. </p>\n<p>Once the kitten is found, the mother cat has to drag it home, except now the mother cat loses the ability to jump and must be extra cautious on the way back home.</p>",

One or two players can compete for dominance in one of the country's most turbulent epochs. Players can choose to control one of the seven available historical warlords, including Liu Bei, Cao Cao, and others.</p>\n<p>The turn-based game is menu-driven for the most part; the player views the map of China and issues orders in the name of the chosen warlord until his turn is over. The player must take care of his state's interior politics, keeping the citizens happy and the army strong, acquiring weapons and food, and engaging in diplomatic missions. </p>\n<p>When the player sends an army to conquer a neighboring land, or is himself attacked by another warlord, the interface switches to top-down, and a tactical battle begins. The player must positions his troops on the battlefield, and navigate them towards the enemies. When two units meet, an automatic skirmish ensues. The battle is over when one of the sides has eliminated the other completely, surrendered, or conquered the enemy's stronghold.</p>",

To complicate matters, Rocky and Bullwinkle's antagonists Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale intend to impede their progress so they can claim the fortune for themselves.</p>\n<p>The game consists of five episodes (stages) of side-scrolling platform action. Players can switch control on the fly to either Bullwinkle or Rocky and will have to do this as each character has their own unique abilities. While both characters can jump and throw bombs, only Rocky possesses the ability to fly while Bullwinkle can charge enemies with his antlers.</p>",

As the eponymous blue robot cat, the player must rescue each of his friends who have been kidnapped. Much like Hudson's earlier title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Challenger\">Challenger</a>, each stage plays differently from the others.</p>\n<p>In the first stage, Doraemon must explore a large top-view overworld. There are open manholes and \"dokodemo Doors\" that lead to various places and to side-scrolling areas. The goal is to find the proper path through the stage and to rescue Nobita. The second stage is a side-scrolling shooting stage, where Doraemon must make his way through three areas in order to rescue Suneo and Gian. The third and final stage is an underwater maze where Doraemon must collect various items and get help from his other friends in order to rescue Shizuka.</p>\n<p>There are numerous items to be found throughout the game that will increase Doraemon's abilities, including increasing his maximum health (which can be refilled be collecting his favorite food Dorapan) and enhancing his offensive capabilities.</p>",

Only one of them stood up to the challenge: entrusted by the king with an important mission, the lone knight must find the reclusive mage Gladrif and figure out a way to get to the source of evil.</p>\n<p><em>Kalin no Tsurugi</em> is an action role-playing game. The player navigates the protagonist on a top-down overworld, entering towns and other locations represented by icons. Monsters are visibly moving on the field; a contact with an enemy leads to a separate battle screen, on which the player character and the enemy fight each other. There is no attack button in the game; damage is inflicted by bumping into the enemy, preferably from the side or rear. Weapons, armor and items can be bought in towns and villages.</p>",

First however, they must occupy a small planet named Star Lenion so they can use it as a launching point for their main attack on the planet Earth. So far on Star Lenion, the Bismark Empire has built a base and are in the process of building a powerful super weapon called the Baltron. The Earth Defense troops have to destroy this base before the Baltron weapon becomes fully functional.</p>\n<p>In this game that is a scrolling horizontal shooter similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Defender\">Defender</a>, players take control of the fastest Earth starship called the Gistorias. Gistorias can attack enemies with its laser and air-to-ground bombs. Gistorias can also unleash a flash smart bomb clearing the screen of enemies. Gistorias can move both right and left, change speed from slow to fast, and can also use a warp boost to try and escape from perilous situations.</p>\n<p>Players also have to monitor Gistorias fuel gauge and make sure it doesn't get to low. Fuel itself can be replenished by picking up fuel containers.</p>",

Once they answered the problem they have to escape the garden without running into the worms that live there. Running into the worms or answering the question wrong will cost the player a try.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Addition 2</strong> - Players control a dentist inside a very large mouth. Players have to drill the tooth that has the correct number on it that answers a math problem. Players have to avoid running into a cavity creature or drilling the wrong tooth by answering the question wrong, or else they will lose a try.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Subtraction 2</strong> - Players have to fly the correctly numbered hot air balloon (the number that answers the math problem), into a frame carried by a bird at the top of the sky. Answering the problem wrong or crashing into another bird will cost the player a try.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In all the minigames, answering the math problems right will build up the players score. However if the player loses all five of their tries, their score will reset back to zero. Also, each minigame has two difficulty levels and also allows for two player alternating play.</p>",

The minigames included are: \n* <strong>Addition &amp; Subtraction 1</strong> - Players control an arrow inside a dungeon maze. Players can only exit the dungeon when they locate a treasure chest. While searching for the treasure chest, players can run into random encounters with a monster that presents the player with a math problem. The problem will be either an addition or subtraction problem depending on the player's choice at the beginning of the game. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Addition &amp; Subtraction 2</strong> - Players control a penguin golfer on a golf course. Players use a meter to determine the strength of the swing of their golf club. After each swing, the player is given a math problem that they will have to solve in order to for their swing to count. Failure to answer the problem correctly will cause the golf ball to return to the spot it was originally hit from. The problem the player is given will be either an addition or subtraction problem depending on the player's choice at the beginning of the game. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Multiplication 1</strong> - Players take the role of a robot factory worker. While parts of a robot go by on a conveyor belt, the player is presented with a math problem to solve. The player has to quickly solve this problem before the robot piece falls off the conveyor belt and winds up on the factory floor. Answering a problem wrong will cause a meter to drain. A fully drained meter will cause this game to restart from the beginning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Multiplication 2</strong> - This minigame presents the player with a view of a multiplication table. Players are given a multiplication problem and have to solve it in order to whack a mole that pops it head out.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

The game features a game mode, puzzle mode, and an edit mode.</p>\n<p>Game mode features several different soko-ban puzzles. Like the typical soko-ban game, this one features a warehouse worker trying to push crates onto designated spots on a warehouse floor. However, this game features a twist to the typical soko-ban gameplay. Moving certain boxes can reveal items that get added to the player's inventory. Items include things such as magnets which can allow the player to pull boxes instead of being only allowed to push them. Players start each puzzle with a score and each step they take decreases their score.</p>\n<p>Puzzle mode is similar to Game mode except items are no longer available. The score is kept by counting every step the player takes.</p>\n<p>Edit mode lets aspiring game designers create and play their very own soko-ban puzzles.</p>",

Besides getting to the goal in time, the other objective is to collect as many sword pieces scattered and hidden throughout each level.</p>\n<p>The second part of the game involves fighting in a series of one on one Kendo matches in order to win the tournament. Using special moves during a fighting match costs the player the sword pieces they collected in the earlier part of training.</p>\n<p>The game also features a two player versus fighting mode.

This mission will take LayLa through eight different explorable asteroids.</p>\n<p>Gameplay mainly involves controlling LayLa through the cavernous maze-like asteroids shooting at the enemies who get in her way. Also of utmost importance is the collection of password disks that are found in each asteroid (they are needed in order to beat the game). Each asteroid contains several elevators that take LayLa to the different areas of the asteroid she is currently in. At the end of each asteroid is a boss monster that LayLa must defeat in order to leave the asteroid.</p>\n<p>LayLa can find several items and weapons in each asteroid. Weapons include things such things as handguns, machine guns, and hand grenades, while usable items include things such as roller skates and a barrier.</p>\n<p>After completing each asteroid level there is a bonus stage involving LayLa flying in her ship on her way to the next asteroid.  The bonus stage is a horizontal side-scrolling shoot-'em-up that is viewed from the side. Destroying an entire squadron of enemies will earn the player bonus points. LayLa can't get hurt during this portion of the game. Bonus rounds are only used to enable the player to increase their score.</p>",

Before being able to qualify to compete at the Olympics, players must travel the globe and defeat several different opponents. When the player finally makes it to the Olympics, the player will have to face nine different opponents, each the best representative of their home country. If the player performs well enough at the Olympics, they can go back home with either a bronze, silver, or even a gold medal.</p>\n<p>When fighting in the Judo matches, the goal is to throw your opponent to the ground for a takedown. When in a fight, there are meters that the player has to be aware of. They are the power meter which measures the fighters current strength and the chance meter which measures the likelihood the player will be able to throw down their opponent. After each match, the player can choose whether to build up their character's strength, technique, or stamina.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Osamu+Tezuka\">Osamu Tezuka</a>'s manga \"Phoenix\", this platformer is mostly based on the fifth volume, \"H\u014d-\u014d\" (later called \"Karma\" when it reached North America in May 2004). Here you play as the bandit Gaou, who lost an arm and eye as a baby and as such was scorned by his peers. Since then he has resorted to various tactics, not least murder, to survive. However, one day he fought a monk who encouraged him to change his ways and follow his unfound natural talent to sculpt, which is thus put to good use in a variety of sculptures unique in their raw emotion. And then, he meets a fellow sculptor, Akanemaru, who once was attacked by him, and the two engage in encounters with a phoenix, who, it is said, will grant to those who drink its blood eternal life - and the rest is history.</p>\n<p>Gaou's goal is to grab the 16 pieces of the picture card which, when fully revealed, will uncover the picture of the Phoenix. The action takes place in 16 stages (one picture card per stage) spread out across three terrains inspired (for the most part) by other volumes in the \"Phoenix\" series. Half of the stages take place in Gaou's own backyard of Feudal Japan (c. 720-752), while five stages take place in a Future World (not unlike those shown in the \"Future\", \"Space\", and \"Resurrection\" volumes) and three stages occur in Prehistoric Times. Some stages, when completed, will lead you to the next, while others from other time periods can only be reached through secret warps. Gaou can use his chisel to attack enemies or the gargoyle head statues he used to chisel with it to make makeshift platforms.\nThe game ends when all three lives are gone - or when Gaou has successfully assembled the Phoenix picture card.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the 22nd century, the conquest of space by the human race has progressed with great momentum. The moon has become inhabitable, and a space development colony has been established on Pluto's Lagrange Point. It is the hope of humanity, with the help of its under-development Hyperzone Drive, that this colony will be the beginning of the further exploration of the universe.</p>\n<p>But, little did they know, that aliens from a far-off corner of the galaxy have different ideas, invading planets left and right and scheming about one day ruling all of outer space. Their ease in conquering planets is such, you'd think they were treating it as just another day at the office.</p>\n<p>One day, the humans' little colony on Pluto felt the wrath of the aliens, and in a matter of minutes their giant warship Gigantos had the poor little inhabitants at their mercy. But it wasn't enough to just conquer the Plutonian colony - they wanted more, and so their sights set on Earth. Faced with utter destruction of their planet, America's newly-formed Space Force was injected with Hyperzone Drive and were sent on their way. But, only one ship knows well enough to control a Hyperzone-fueled craft. Its name - Falsion.</p>\n<p>As Falsion, you're mankind's last hope against the invading forces of the aliens. Armed with a beam weapon plus an expendable amount of homing missiles, your job is to blast through 6 first-person levels of standard-fare enemies and their huge leaders. Along the way, you'll find red (to increase your missile supply) and blue (to speed you up) capsules. And the action can only get more intense in the 3D mode, as enemies will seem to leap out of the TV screen and towards you.</p>",

Help guide Little Red to her Grandma.</p>\n<p><em>Little Red Hood</em> is loosely based on the story of Little Red Riding Hood. Walk Red around the screen until a random staircase appears. Walk onto this staircase to enter the area where you may find a candy that will refill one heart, hearts that increase your heart count, crowns that are money and, maybe, the key. You need the key and must keep entering staircases until you find it. Once you have the key, you must kick trees to get fruits. You need ten fruits to make a special staircase appear. Enter this stair to exit to the next level. Above ground, you will encounter goblins that, if they touch you, remove one heart and Bear and Big Bad Wolf who kill instantly. Below ground, you will find hedgehogs and snakes that remove one heart. If you touch a Bear, Big Bad Wolf or lose all your hearts, you lose a life. Lose all lives and the game is over. At the top of the above ground screen, there are shops that sell invincibility potions, hearts and slingshots. The heart restores one heart, the potion makes you invincible for a time and the slingshot lets you kill goblins until it runs out. Also, above ground, are rocks that, when kicked, may give you candies or hearts or release an enemy.</p>",

Players control the feline Chatran as he tries to return home to the farm he got separated from so that he can reunite with his girlfriend.</p>\n<p>The game contains 24 different side-scrolling stages. Every two stages counts as a month of time, with one stage counting as daytime and the other as nighttime. The main goal of each stage is to dodge enemies and get to end of the stage unhurt and within the time limit. Although Chatran cannot directly attack enemies, he's not totally defenseless. He can drop any eggs that he has picked up onto his enemies to dispose of them. Chatran can find these eggs plus other items like fruit by jumping into tree leaves thus shaking the items loose. Collecting 50 pieces of fruit will earn Chatran an extra life. There are also eggs that contain letters on them. Spelling out the word HELP will summon Chatran's canine companion Poosky, who can defeat any enemies that gets in his way.</p>",

The game shows Lum going through different stages of her life (from childhood to adulthood) fighting off alien invaders, until she is finally old enough to marry Ataru.</p>\n<p>Gameplay stages involve climbing up several floors of a building in order to get to a waiting UFO. Lum can't dilly-dally though, as the building she is climbing up is on fire and the flames are constantly rising. Enemies are also in the way to impede Lum's path. Lum can shoot at these enemies with lightning bolts. Lum can also pick up power-ups such as ones that can increase the players score, grant her temporary invincibility, and let her enter a bonus stage where Lum has to shoot down flying enemies.</p>\n<p>An arcade version was released as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/74399/momoko-120/\">Momoko 120%</a> with an original character and setting in place of the Urusei Yatsura license.</p>",

The minigames included are: \n* <strong>Division</strong> - Players control a man in front of a building which has several doors. Entering a door will bring the player to a separate room where they have to try and locate the correct number that solves a long division problem that they are given. These separate rooms are protected by monsters that the player has to either avoid or kill with a sword. Players also have to be careful not to run into the invincible ghost that protects the outside of the building. Once the problem is solved, players have to climb to the top of the building to go on to the next division problem.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Decimal Addition &amp; Subtraction</strong> - This mode features the same gameplay as the <strong>Division</strong> mode, except instead of solving a division problem, the player is solving either an addition or subtraction problem (depending on which mode they have chosen) that involves decimals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fraction Addition &amp; Subtraction</strong> - Players control a car on a maze-like race track. Players have to locate the correct number tile that solves a fraction addition or subtraction problem (depending on which mode they have chosen). After completely solving the problem, the player has to find the exit tile to move on to the next math problem. Players also have to be careful not to crash into any enemy cars.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Decimal Multiplication &amp; Division</strong> - This mode features the same gameplay as the <strong>Division</strong> mode, except instead of solving a division problem, the player is solving either a multiplication or division problem (depending on which mode they have chosen) that involves decimals.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each minigame has two difficulty levels and also allows for two player alternating play.</p>",

Only one mode (World Cup) is available, playable by either one player against the computer AI or two players against each other. Any of the sixteen available national teams can be selected by the player; the opponent cannot be chosen manually if controlled by the AI. The game itself allows only basic moves such as passing, shooting, and side-sliding during defense. There is no team management or strategy available, and no options for game rules and conditions.</p>",

At certain intervals, the ship will land in front of a building and the pilot enters a room. In the room, the player is presented with a multiplication problem that involves decimals. Players have to select the correct numbers that solve the problem while also dodging bullets being fired by gun turrets. Solving the problem correctly will let the player move on to the next stage.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Decimal Division</strong> - This mode features the same gameplay as the <strong>Decimal Multiplication</strong> mode, except instead of solving a multiplication problem, the player is solving a division problem that involves decimals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fraction Addition &amp; Subtraction</strong> - Players control a girl on a field. Players are presented with a fraction addition or subtraction problem depending on the chosen mode. To solve this problem players have to first water the seeds that are on the ground. Watering seeds will eventual turn them into red or white flowers, which will eventually become ball shaped if continually watered. Once the flowers are ball shaped they can be pushed into a numbered basket, but only the white flowers should be and not the red ones, as the red ones are more of an obstacle and will affect the player negatively if they are placed into a basket. The number on the basket represents the number the player is selecting to solve the math problem. Players also have to be careful not to get hit by any of the animals roaming around in the field. The player is equipped with a spray that can temporarily stun the enemies if they get too close.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fraction Multiplication &amp; Division</strong> - This mode features the same gameplay as the <strong>Fraction Addition &amp; Subtraction</strong> mode, except instead of solving addition &amp; subtraction problems,the player is solving either an multiplication or division problem (depending on which mode they have chosen) that involves fractions.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each minigame has different difficulty levels and also allows for two player alternating play.</p>",

As Mamoru, a bookworm with ESP, you must go forth (with the help of a magical fairy and several other allies) to grab five special rings and save the Book Worlds from many perils.</p>\n<p>This sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/54668/esper-dream/\">Esper Dream</a> takes you as Mamoru on a mystical journey through 4 areas (one of them, the world of the original \"Esper Dream\", has already been done for you), each with their own problems that you need to fix. Like its predecessor, you begin battles (which now take place in different battlefields) by running into pairs of moving footprints - however this time Mamoru can simply run away from battles that are too much for him, or use a Teleport spell in enclosed fields. (Using this spell outside of battle will return you to the base town for that world.) In addition, Mamoru can bring along a friend (one per world and controlled by the CPU) who can assist him while battling and give him clues about where to go next. Mamoru can also carry healing items with him, for a quick boost of energy when he's running low.</p>\n<p>The game ends when Mamoru's HP reaches 0 - or when you have saved the Book Worlds.</p>",

Shooting at the various enemies and destroying them will cause them to drop capsules. There are two different capsule types. One capsule will fill the players oxygen while the other increases the amount of money the player has.

Since the player is walking in outerspace their oxygen supply is constantly draining and can only be replenished by collecting oxygen capsules dropped from defeated enemies. Dungeon areas also contain shops where the player can upgrade their weapons, defensive items, and energy.</p>\n<p>Being a part of Imagineer's Wave Jack series, the game also came with an audio cassette tape and a book that helped explain the game's narrative.</p>",

Two players can compete in a versus mode, each representing a high school team from various cities in Japan. In the tournament mode, the player competes against AI-controlled teams according to the competition schedule. Games between AI-controlled opponents can be viewed fully, or appear only as results. Substitutions can be made before a game begins, but there is no other team management. Pitchers and batters are controlled from a third-person perspective. Teams can be compared to each either statistics-wise, and their names can be changed.</p>\n<p>The game was westernized as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10357/little-league-baseball-championship-series/\">Little League Baseball Championship Series</a> which features teams from around the world.</p>",

Time pieces can be spent at teleporters so that the player can travel to different time periods and also these time pieces can be spent at shops in order to buy equipment.</p>\n<p>The player can also find buildings to enter into.

        "description": "<p>This game is based on the Chinese novel <em>Journey to the West</em>. The goal of the game is to survive the long and arduous journey from China to India.</p>\n<p>Players take control of Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, as he helps guide \nXuanzang, a Buddhist monk, on his quest to collect some Buddhist sutras. Xuanzang also rides a horse who is actually a dragon prince. Along the way, players will also join up with other guardians to add to their party.</p>\n<p>In the game, players go on a journey across an overworld map. Players have to find certain locations or buildings in order to move along in their adventure. Some buildings will lead the player into a short side-scrolling action stage where the player has to defeat an onslaught of enemies. Also, players have to be on a lookout for spots where they can pick up food and drink so they don't starve or die of thirst on their lengthy journey.</p>\n<p>Since the game lacks a proper save feature, the player will occasionally be given a code input to put in at the game's title screen, so the player can continue the game from where the code input was given.</p>",

One day, to make sure that they would have sunny days, the people of Muu invented a device called the Dream Machine, which would manufacture pleasant dreams for all. But, a mischievous monster named Mamu rigged the Dream Machine, changing it to produce monsters. Mamu, however, had one weakness - he absolutely hated vegetables. So the people of Muu hurled as many vegetables as they could into the monster and eventually he was buried. And the people of Muu lived happily - not to mention dreamily - ever after.</p>\n<p>But the story doesn't end there - for one day, a monkey named Rusa discovered a book containing this story and gave it to two twins, Piki and Poki. After a while, however, they started arguing. Push came to shove until eventually it happened - they ripped the last page from the book. In an instant the twins were caught by a mysterious hand and sucked in - but luckily for them the twins' older brother Imajin arrived in time to see the hand disappear back into the book. Now he, his sister Lina, and their parents must get them back!</p>\n<p>In <em>Yume K\u014dj\u014d: Dokidoki Panic</em>, a single player takes control of the four members of the family who were the mascots of Fuji Television's <em>Yume K\u014dj\u014d '87</em> event through seven chapters full of platforming challenges, bosses, bonus money, the always helpful heart, and invincible star, plus bombs and magic lamps. After each level, collected coins can be used in a bonus game to collect extra lives. After a family member has defeated Mamu, it's up to another one to bust through. When all four have defeated Mamu, the game is finished and Piki and Poki are saved.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Zooming Secretary</em> is a homebrew game, where you play as a secretary who has to answer phone calls asking trivia information on the subject of history, geography, literature or astronomy. You answer by going to the appropriate file cabinet, remember the topic and then answer the call. You can only hold one topic in your head at a time, indicated by an icon in the top left hand corner. The caller want answers and they want them quick, a phone call starts blue, then red and finally white, before hanging up. Miss five calls and you're fired, although they immediately rehire meaning you have infinite continues.</p>\n<p>Also in the office are your co-workers, they mostly distract you from your work although some of them could be helpful. There's the chief who likes to give you instructions and thing that it will make you hurry, but in fact it only slows things down. A woman in red dress with cookies who hangs around all the day, she's big so you can't pass through her. A tall nerdy girl who likes to talk very much, but can't concentrate. She constantly changes topics and may confuse you, but sometimes she may tell something that you actually need. The geeky guy who loves you but fears to even come close, and always acts so awkward that sometimes he can be an obstacle. Swamper with a huge box walks around aimlessly, knocking you down. A handsome guy who inspires you a lot but he always tries to avoid you. Touch him and you get a \"wild card\" topic with which you can answer any phonecall.</p>\n<p>Each level is one day at the office, there are 7 days and one dream section. Beat the game to earn a vacation at the beach.</p>",

Worlds are divided on rooms, each one with several medals which you have to collect before advancing to another one. Rooms are filled up with various types of enemies (shooter, grenadier, bomber, etc.) and labyrinths, providing a gradual challenge on medal collect.

The player controls a kid named Buzz or his partner, as they traverse predominantly outdoor areas with various themes (plains, forests, ice world, etc.). The protagonist does not use weapons and defeats enemies by performing a spinning movement. The same ability is also used to crush blocks from four directions. </p>\n<p>The stages have a certain degree of non-linearity, since the objective in each of them (except boss battles) is to find and collect a certain number of keys; once the last one is collected, the level ends automatically. These keys are usually found on top of high platforms or in enclosed areas that can only be accessed through special teleporters. Power-ups include shoes that allow the hero to perform a double jump, and a feather that makes it possible to jump very high and float in the air for a while.</p>",

The most important part of Hott\u0101man's exploration efforts is to find four keys that are contained in treasure chests spread about in each location. Finding these keys will unlock the exit, so he can continue exploring the next location.</p>\n<p>The games underground exploration is reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/139/dig-dug/\">Dig Dug</a>, however the underground is much larger here and is able to be scrolled as in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Boulder+Dash\">Boulder Dash</a>.</p>\n<p>While exploring the underground, digging up dirt and rocks, players have to be wary of various obstacles and enemies. Obstacles include blocks, pits that can transport Hott\u0101man to a different area, streams of water, and even lava pools. If the player stays to long in a level, vertical streams of lava will start to appear, making the lever harder and more dangerous to traverse. </p>\n<p>Of course Hott\u0101man's not completely helpless against these enemies and obstacles. Hott\u0101man's equipped with a flamethrower that he can fire against his enemies. He can also pick up items to add to his inventory. Items can sometimes be found just lying around the level openly, or can be found inside several of the treasure chests and eggs that are spread around. Items that are part of his inventory include a fire-proof coat to use against lava, a range item that extends the range of the flame weapon, a blockade item that can block pursuing enemies, both a fruit and a garlic item which help distract enemies, and dynamite which can blow up blocks that are in the way. Only four of each of these items are allowed to be held in the player's inventory. There are also other items like the power shovel which can also aid Hott\u0101man.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Gall Force: Eternal Story</em> is a game that tells an additional tale from the Gall Force anime series, a series which revolves around a galactic battle between the all-female Solnoids and the race known as the Paranoids. This game tells the story of Rabby, the second-in-command of the space cruiser Star Leaf, having to rescue her six crew mates and also destroy the fortress of the Paranoids.</p>\n<p>The game is a vertical scrolling shoot-'em-up. Players start by flying over the surface of the planet Terra, dodging and destroying enemies until they reach a set of launchers. Each launcher launches the player's ship into a different section of outer space. Each section features more shoot-em' up action until at the end a boss enemy appears. Defeating the boss enemy of a space section will release one the kidnapped crew members from bondage and allow them to rejoin back onto the Star Leaf crew.</p>\n<p>Once a crew member is rescued they can be selected and they will transform the Star Leaf and use their own unique powers. Their powers typically affect on how the Star Leaf fires its' weapons. There are other power-ups that can collected such as the crash star that clears the screen of enemies, the barrier which provides the Star Leaf temporary invincibility, and the speed up icon which lets the Star Fleet maneuver faster than usual.</p>",

This time the case involves trying to solve the mystery of the kidnapped countess.</p>\n<p>Holmes has to travel all over Great Britain by train so he can find clues. He first searches the cities looking for locations he can investigate more thoroughly. Once he finds the locations, such as parks, sewers, or houses, the game switches to a side-scrolling action game. In these areas clues and items can be found either laying around or by interrogating hostile thugs. Dealing with the thugs will slowly build up a percentage that Holmes will have to get to one hundred percent in order to finish the game. In each city Holmes is looking for the main boss who when defeated gives out a password. This password then must be used at a gang hideout to complete a city's investigation. </p>\n<p>Holmes can kick enemies (and also innocent citizens who happen to cough up some money when defeated) as a means of offense. He can also acquire weapons such as a knife or a gun as additional offensive options. Holmes can also collect several inventory items like a magnifying glass, a lamp, keys, and medicine bottles to assist him along the way. Holmes has to be careful not to fall into a pit, be shot or even be touched too many times, or else this case will remain forever unsolved.</p>",

He is on a mission to rescue Princess Patricia who is being held deep inside a dungeon labyrinth. Gameplay is viewed top down similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3393/the-legend-of-zelda/\">The Legend of Zelda</a>. Players have to explore a dungeon maze dealing with enemies and solving basic math problems so that they can open locked doors to go further into the maze. Finding the right way to go will allow the player to explore more floors of the dungeon. There are nine floors in all.</p>\n<p>The second game is called Step Drill in which players run a marathon. To get a good time on the marathon, players have to answer math problems as fast as they can.</p>\n<p>The game was originally packaged along with a comic book.</p>",

The view mode lets the player see their ship in a current sector of space. Players are able to fly around with their ship and fire their torpedoes and phasers at any enemy ships they may happen to run into. Players can also warp their ship to other sections of the galaxy. If the player's ship receives any type of damage they can dock their ship at a base for repairs.</p>",

Along the way, the player needs to find all the special items to open the last door. With each step, the player's POW is depleted, which can be regenerated by collecting items along the way. There are secret rooms and items that can assist the player in reaching the goal. There are also three mini-games that can be found in the maze. A mini-map can be brought up, but this will cost POW.</p>\n<p>The game has no combat to speak of or random encounters.

However, during her visit to Japan, she has suddenly vanished and nobody knows where she has went. Now it's up to the player to play detective and solve this baffling case of the missing princess.</p>\n<p>The game features five different towns to explore. The purpose of exploring the town is to find out information from the locals. While most locals are friendly, some are hostile like the gang members that will fire at anyone getting in their way. Players are armed with a gun that can kill these enemies, but they must be careful not to accidentally fire on too many innocent civilians (or else the player may be arrested and fined). </p>\n<p>While inside a town, players can also do extracurricular activities such as eating at restaurants, do some training at a dojo, and collect vegetables in order to sell them off for money. The game also features a day-night cycle which can have an effect on who the player runs into while exploring. </p>\n<p>Some parts of the investigation will lead the player to play a side-scrolling action platformer. During this part of the game, players have to deal with enemies by shooting them, collect items and money lying around, and sometimes jump on springs to make jumps onto high up platforms.</p>\n<p>Being a part of Imagineer's Wave Jack series, the game also came with extra paraphernalia such as an audio cassette tape and a map.The audio cassette tape contains hints as well as songs from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/738310/yasuko-tomita/\">Yasuko Tomita</a>, a Japanese actress and singer. She is also featured on a poster that came with the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Nantettatte!! Baseball</em> you control one of 16 cartoon-styled teams and try to lead them on to victory. The gameplay is simple and similar to many other baseball games released on the NES, with five ways to play. You can play a versus mode against either the computer or a partner, take a team through a season of between 30 and 130 games in hopes of winning the pennant, play a multiplayer tournament, or play a home run derby and try to knock as many balls as you can out of the park. There's also an edit mode where you can configure your team for the Pennant Mode, and a \"Watch\" mode where you can watch a CPU-controlled match.</p>\n<p>Each of the sixteen teams, just like actual baseball teams, have strengths and weaknesses. Seven of the teams also have designated hitters, who replace pitchers when it's their turn at bat. All teams also have eight starters, who can be switched out at any point (but cannot be switched back). The teams can play in either one of four stadiums, which all are basically the same.</p>\n<p>In addition, attached to the game cartridge is a slot for smaller data cartridges, which when inserted update team rosters, allowing for more teams to play as.</p>",

Well it's just his luck that the earth is under siege from all sorts of these monsters. Now it's up to Hayate and his fighting machine alter ego Ultraman to save the day.</p>\n<p>The game features eleven different timed stages. The majority of stages involve Hayate shooting enemies in the hopes that they drop beta capsules or collecting any capsules he can find in a stage. Collecting these capsules will fill up a meter. When this meter is filled, the player can then transform Hayate into Ultraman. This is necessary as only Ultraman has the ability to defeat the large boss monster(s) that appear in each stage. However transforming into Ultraman leaves the player only three minutes to defeat the current stage he is on. The game also features a few horizontal scrolling shooter stages.</p>\n<p>Defeating the game once, will then let the player play as Dan Moroboshi and his alter ego Ultra-Seven. The enemies in this mode take more hits to defeat.</p>\n<p>After the game's original release, it was later re-released on a disk writer kiosk. The only difference in this later released version is that the some of the background music has been changed.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The <em>Nintendo Campus Challenge 1991</em> was held at 58 college campuses or spring break locations, and also at the 1991 Consumer Electronics Show. Competitors could play NES and Game Boy games throughout the day to achieve the highest score. The players with the highest scores were then flown to Disney World in Orlando, Florida, USA over the New Year's weekend to compete further.</p>\n<p>At this competition, players played a special cartridge made just for this event. The cartridge consisted of three games. Player must first gather 25 coins in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7300/super-mario-bros-3/\">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>. Next, they must get 100,000 points in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8689/pin-bot/\">Pin*Bot</a>. Lastly, players play <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6116/dr-mario/\">Dr. Mario</a> to get what score they can in the remaining time.</p>\n<p>The scores are then tallied up with the following formula: The <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> score is multiplied by 10, then it gets added to the <em>Pin*Bot</em> score, then the <em>Dr. Mario</em> score is multiplied by 100 and gets added together with the other scores which results in the final score. The top six players then played a second round, then the top two players of the previous round played a head-to-head final battle.</p>",

Pictures are broken up into thirty different squares in a five by six square tile layout. Players control their avatar (it changes depending on the round) and pick up the tiles one at a time and place the tiles back in their proper place. Each puzzle must be completed in under ten minutes or else the game is over.</p>\n<p>While trying to solve each puzzle, various enemies will be roaming around the play area. Running into them will cost the player some health. If the player loses all of their health, they will lose a life. If the player loses all three of their lives, the game will end.</p>\n<p>While trying to solve a puzzle, the player can pause the game and view an unscrambled picture of the puzzle they are working on. After looking at the solution the first time, each additional time after the unscrambled picture will start to degrade in quality and be of less of a help for the player.</p>\n<p>Once the puzzle is solved, the amount of remaining time plus the amount of health the player has left over is calculated into the player's score.</p>",

Players get to take control of Nintendo's mascots Mario and Luigi (in the 2 player game) and play over 18 holes of golf on courses modeled after real courses in Japan.</p>\n<p>Players can choose to either try their skills in match play or stroke play.\nMatch play involves two golfers trying to win the most holes. They win holes by getting the better score than their competitor. Stroke play differs as it just involves the golfer trying to get the best score possible by completing each hole in as few strokes as possible.</p>\n<p>When on the golf course, players can choose the club they want to use, adjust the speed and strength (from a 1 to 3 scale) of their swing, and aim in the direction they want to hit the ball. Hitting the ball involves the use of a meter with an icon that goes back and forth, which gauges the distance the ball is hit. Players can take a step back from the tee and take practice swings so they can get into a rhythm using this meter. </p>\n<p>This game also contained a now defunct feature where players could record their personal information and their best scores and then bring the game disk to a Disk Fax machine. Inserting the disk into this machine would fax over the player's information to Nintendo's headquarters. This information was used for a contest. Being selected a contest winner would award the player with a golden colored disk version of this game. This golden disk version of the game contained an exclusive course that was not present on the original version of this game. </p>\n<p>A few months after this game was released, it was followed up by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Family+Computer+Golf:+U.S.+Course\">Family Computer Golf: U.S. Course</a>, a similar game that featured U.S. courses.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Between 1984 to 1986, <em>Irem</em> released four more different Lode Runner arcade games in Japan after the original arcade game's release. 55 stages were culled from these arcade games and were packaged into <em>Super Lode Runner</em> for the Famicom Disk System. The game also kept the innovation from the arcade games of the two-player mode and brought in 15 stages for simultaneous action.</p>\n<p>The game keeps the typical gameplay of the Lode Runner series. Players have to collect all the gold on the stage, while either avoiding or trapping the robotic guards who are constantly giving them chase. The game also features a level editor so players can create their own stages to play on.</p>\n<p>A few months after this game was released, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Super+Lode+Runner+II\">Super Lode Runner II</a> was released which is similar to this game, only it included different stages from the arcade games. Also, this game shouldn't be confused with the MSX game with the same <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/78689/super-lode-runner/\">title</a>. While in a similar situation as this game, it contains an entirely different set of stages to play.</p>",

A party at the villa of a wealthy company president is marred by the death of a guest and the disappearance of a priceless diamond, the Star of Africa, and Sanma is called on to investigate. As the plot progresses, the player opens up various locations around Osaka, where the player encounters a seemingly endless stream of suspicious characters - most of whom just happen to be other well known real-life comedians (all of whom worked for the same studio as Sanma at that time).</p>\n<p>Gameplay follows the standard adventure game first-person menu driven model (Look, Examine, Take, Use, etc.). There is also a pointer to examine specific points of interest, and a third-person map used to move between locations. The game features various action-oriented minigames which must be passed to advance the plot, most notably a parody of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/1043/bandai-namco-amusement-inc/\">Namco's</a> own <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Galaxian\">Galaxian</a></em>.</p>",

It's a beautiful diamond ring, and it's impossible to resist! Unfortunately, it costs $10,000 - way beyond his budget. And to make matters worse, another man named Nick has eyes for Betty. Now our hero will have to work extra, EXTRA hard to buy it and impress Betty!</p>\n<p>In <em>Pizza Pop!</em>, the player fights through seven crazy neighborhoods populated by a whole host of pizza-hungry characters. The player can, however, defeat his enemies by jumping on them, or whacking them with his pizza pan. The player can also run through the level or use motor vehicles to get around, but he can't run for too long or else he'll get tired - unless he jumps while running. In addition, there are two pizza-stacking mini-games which can earn the player points and extra lives.</p>\n<p>Players begin the game with 3 lives, with three hits (to start) per life, but more lives and a maximum of five hits can be earned. The game is over either when all lives have been lost or the final boss has been defeated.</p>",

Players take control of the twin brothers (players can switch back and forth between each brother in the one player game) and explore the maze-like city, trying to locate and collect ten puppies. Several enemies roam the streets and the twins can throw punches or even baseballs at them in order to defend themselves. Defeating enemies increases the twins energy counter. Their energy also acts as a currency. They can and must spend their energy on certain items they find at shops. Only certain items can be used to beat the boss monsters who are holding the puppies captive. The twins will also need to locate certain shops to discard of items they no longer need as they each can only carry a handful of items at a time.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Two musicians, Moeta and Goro, travel across Japan trying to gain musical stardom. Their journey in Japan takes them to places such as Harajuku and the Roppongi district, with their ultimate goal of performing in the United States of America in New York.</p>\n<p><em>Hana no Star Kaid\u014d</em> is a side-scrolling platformer containing six stages. The stages however aren't straightforward as the player has to find the right path to take in order to reach the ending of a stage, The first part of the stage involves navigating streets until the correct music studio building is found. The game then switches to navigating the inside of the building until finding the end of stage teleporter. The game has a heart countdown timer that will cause the boys to lose their lives if it runs out. The timer gets refilled when the boys enter the studio or start a new stage.</p>\n<p>A unique feature of the gameplay is that the player has to control both characters at the same time. Both characters move in tandem and the player can control the distance they stand by each other. Each one has their own life count, and the game is over as soon as one of them loses all of their lives. They can earn back a life by completing a stage.</p>\n<p>Moeta and Goro can defend themselves by firing out musical notes at enemies to stun them or with enough shots kill them. Some stunned enemies can be induced to give up the gold records they are carrying. Gold records can also be found lying around the stage or uncovered by destroying objects. Each stage requires a certain number of gold records to collect in order for the stage to be completed. Also a special item exists on each stage, like a cassette tape, that must be collected and in the boys possession at the end of the stage in order to complete it. Getting hit by projectiles fired by some enemies or the projectiles randomly dropping from above can cause the boys to lose the special item or reduce the count of gold records so the boys must do their best to avoid them or else they will have to spend time recollecting the lost items. Other items are scattered about the stages, like an electric guitar that provides temporary invincibility.</p>",

However a member of the Bibi Order steals her script and now she has to get it back.</p>\n<p><em>Lost Word of JeNnY: Ushinawareta Message</em> starts out with JeNnY outside on a street. This area acts as a hub world where JeNnY has to enter and complete six areas before finally entering the musical theater. The six areas are Batora's Tower, Ghost Mansion, Flowerland, Gabacho The Ship, Monster's House, and the Milkyway Fantasy. JeNnY's objective in these areas are to find a letter, a number, and to collect a key so she can use it to enter the next area. JeNnY will be attacked by each area's inhabitants, but she can defend herself by kicking and punching, and also by using a limited amount of spray. She can also find things such as necklaces which grant temporary invulnerability and bottles to replenish her health bar. After she completes an area she has to enter a Cow Head stage where she has to defeat the guardian(s) in order to leave. After that she will play a bonus game (similar to a slot machine) with Whomanchun. Whomanchun is a fortune teller and can give JeNnY bonuses if she gets specific numbers. When she finally enters the musical, she'll be asked what the number is that correctly matches the letter in the area they appeared together in.</p>",

Like in other Daisenryaku games, each side has to produce units such as infantry, several types of tanks, helicopters, etc. Attack is possible, when enemies are near.</p>\n<p>The game includes 30 maps with varied types of locations and terrains (islands, deserts, mountains, etc.) Each terrain type has different movement and defence values.</p>\n<p>This version uses \"fake hexagons\" for battlefields; the hexagons are in fact squares, with six neighbours. As opposed to most other versions, it has round-based combat, i.e. a turn ends when the player has moved all the units. It also has a less complex management system than the computer versions.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Otocky</em>, players pilot a flying creature throughout eleven horizontal scrolling stages on a mission to collect musical notes. The creature is equipped with a ball that can be fired in eight different directions. Depending on the direction it is fired it will create a unique sound, thus merging with the background music, creating a rhythm to the action going on. The ball is meant to collect musical notes, but it can also take out enemies that are getting in the way. The creature is also equipped with a limited projectile attack in case the enemies start to get too overwhelming, The object of each stage is to collect musical notes in order to fill up a meter till it shows five note icons. The stages will keep looping until the player fills up this meter, and the spots where the musical notes the player already collected will change into enemy combatants, making each additional loop through a stage more difficult than the previous one. At the point when the meter is filled, the players ship will be warped to the stage boss, which in this game are large musical notes. </p>\n<p>After completing the game two additional modes are unlocked. These modes let the player select any stage they want. In the B.G.M mode, the stages are free of enemies and players can fly through them and create music without enemy harassment. The other mode is called the Music Maker mode. This mode allows players to create and edit their own soundtracks.</p>",

Five beautiful, clever, and strong women form a group called \"Aurora\". They are the ones who control Fuyuu City and its surroundings. A nameless guy winds up in Fuyuu City with his memory lost. He is outraged by what he sees there, and decides to help the discriminated men.</p>\n<p><em>Otaku no Seiza</em> is a Japanese-style role-playing game with humorous overtones. The gameplay system closely follows the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dragon+Quest\">Dragon Quest</a> template: the player navigates the hero and his companions over a top-down world map, visiting towns and dungeons, and engaging in first-person turn-based battles against randomly appearing enemies. Characters can execute special attacks called \"Force\". Leveling up is automatic, and interaction with characters and the environment requires selecting \"Talk\" and \"Search\" commands from a menu, respectively.</p>",

You had come to spend summer vacation with your father at a dig in Alexandria, but now he has been abducted by demons in fulfillment of an ancient curse! You must set out on a quest to ancient tombs and temples along the length of the Nile, battling thieves and demons in search of an ancient necklace\u2013the Tear of Isis\u2013with which you can dispel the evil spirits and free your father.</p>\n<p>The game is an adventure/RPG hybrid, with simple turn-based battles occurring within the framework of a typical menu-based first-person adventure game. Movement, examination, and interaction are all achieved via menu options (go, look, take, use, etc.); battles simply restrict the menu to three basic combat options (attack, use item, or flee). The player character levels with experience, but this only determines maximum HP, while attack and defense are based on the best weapon and armor currently in inventory.</p>",

He lives with his lover, and life couldn't be finer... but things don't always go the way you planned in India. One day, an evil demon kidnapped his girl, and locked her up deep in the temple of Dababa. No time for serenity - it's time to hop, skip and jump to her aid quick, before bad things happen!</p>\n<p>In <em>Meiky\u016b Jiin Dababa</em>, a single player controls an Indian monk bent on recovering his girlfriend from the Dababa labyrinth. The player must negotiate his/her way through Dababa by jumping from one tile to the next. In most stages, hopping on the tiles containing seals will uncover them, and when all the seals are uncovered, the gateway to the next stage will unlock. Along the way, the player must not only watch out for enemies that can also jump tiles, but also trick doors that takes the monk back to earlier stages. The game is over when either the player loses his/her last monk or the monk's partner is recovered.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The second game in the Famicom Grand Prix series. In a departure from its predecessor, <em>Famicom Grand Prix II</em> features a behind-the-car view similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Outrun\">Outrun</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7765/rad-racer/\">Rad Racer</a>. Rather than consisting of a handful of short tracks, 3D Hot Rally provides three long tracks consisting of a variety of different terrain types giving the feel of an actual rally race. Each track has multiple routes to the finish line, requiring you to find the best path to victory. The game features three cars to choose from: the speedy Kattobi coupe, the balanced Yonque truck, or the rugged Monster buggy.</p>\n<p>In order to complete a race, players must reach each checkpoint within a certain time limit. If the limit is crossed too late, time is subtracted from their bank. If the time bank is depleted, the race is over. Successfully reaching a checkpoint before the time limit is reached banks extra time. Players can also collect exclamation marks scattered throughout the tracks. Collecting enough exclamation marks to fill the dash meter allows temporary access to the hot dash, a fifth gear that greatly increases speed. Before each race, you're asked to place a repair point somewhere on the track, allowing you to repair any damage done to your car, so long as you pick a route that leads you past that checkpoint. Taking too much damage puts you out of the race.</p>\n<p>As the name implies, 3D Hot Rally allows you to use the Famicom 3D System glasses to give the race a real feeling of depth. It also challenged players to submit their best times via Famicom Disk Fax kiosks located in various stores for a chance to win a Disk-kun stationary set.</p>",

Much like its inspiration, players take turns moving around the board, which is divided into districts made up of multiple properties. Landing on a property allows you to buy it, and owning multiple properties in the same district increases their value, but landing on a property owned by another player forces you to pay them based on the property's value.</p>\n<p>A key element is the ability to invest in districts by purchasing stock, even if the player owns no property in that district, which increases the value of those properties and gives the player a cut of any transactions involving that district. There is also a roulette mini-game, and a chance board there players can pick random prizes. The goal is to be the first player to amass a certain amount of net worth, then return to the bank. Up to four players can play at once, with computer players filling in any empty slots. There are 7 different characters and five different board layouts to choose from.</p>",

Rescue Princess Niketa and save the land of Vegitafruit from this insect invasion.</p>\n<p><em>Kick Challenger</em> utilizes a novel movement system. Each foot must be maneuvered and placed, one foot at a time, in a system that mimics actual upright walking. Kicks can be fired off in eight directions using whichever foot isn't currently planted. Levels are tailored specifically for this movement style, and simulate hills, narrow pipes, and other hazards that require you to be mindful of where you're planting those tootsies.</p>\n<p>Power-ups can be found by kicking the various fauna and bric-a-brac that fill the game's levels. These take the form of shoes that increase the tomato's stride or allow the player to walk on certain surfaces, or various items that give the player temporary abilities. Levels follow a linear upwards progression with no way to retreat backwards except by going through trap doors. In order to progress, the player must find their way through the maze-like levels and defeat the boss waiting at the end of them.</p>",

The grappling hook is extremely indispensable as it is used to climb upwards to out-of-reach ledges. This skill is used frequently as it is required to advance through the often vertically oriented stages. Kaito begins with nothing more than a set of throwing knives, but along the way he can find bombs, pistols, bolas, screen clearing crystals, and mines. With some diligent searching, he can even find health extending necklaces and 1ups in the form of fedoras.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Captain ED</em> is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up. Players pilot a ship through seven different levels of outer space in order to rescue their friends from captivity and to defeat Doguma. Players must shoot down enemy ships to earn money. This money can then be used at the sporadically placed gas stations to refill their ships energy. Also, money can be spent at shops where the player can purchase various items. Items include weapon upgrades such as double lasers and missiles and more importantly key items that must be purchased before being allowed to complete a level.</p>\n<p>Throughout each level are different colored tiles that are constantly moving. Flying over certain colored tiles reduces the ships energy, however certain tiles can be smashed open with the ship's equipped hammer. Smashed tiles reveal items that can be picked up such as coins which give the player more money and power-ups like invulnerability. The most important item to find in these locations is the Warp Drive. This item will warp the player to either a mini-game or more importantly a boss fight.</p>\n<p>Mini-games can earn the player money. The mini-games include things such as a simple card games like High or Low and a game where the the objective is to play the drums by following a rhythm correctly. </p>\n<p>Stage bosses take multiple hits to defeat. Once the player beats the seven stage bosses they are sent to the final stage to face down the final boss.</p>",

Payers are presented with a four by seven grid map. This map lets the player select their next horizontally or vertically adjacent area of battle. The further the player gets away from their home base, the more enemy vehicles they will have to face in battle. The number of enemy vehicles range from four to eight depending on the location of the battle. </p>\n<p>Once the location of a battle is chosen, players are presented with eight different naval vehicles to pick from. The vehicles to choose from are aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, destroyers, nuclear submarines, bombers, submarines, and spy planes. Each vehicle has its own size and comes with its own unique special weapons. Most special weapons increase a vehicles firepower (i.e. hits more squares on the battlefield). In order to use these special weapons, the player has to spend their allotted unit points for ammunition. These special weapons can only be used while the vehicle is still active. If the vehicle gets destroyed, the weapons are no longer available to use.</p>\n<p>Players then place their vehicles on the fourteen by eight battlefield and then take turns with their enemy firing at each others vehicles. Whoever sinks all their opponents vehicles first wins the battle.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A heavily modified port of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9241/little-computer-people/\">Little Computer People</a>, <em>Apple Town Monogatari</em> is an early life simulator. It stars a randomly named little girl who lives in a 3 story house with her cat. Very little interaction is featured in the game. Gameplay largely involves simply watching the girl go about their daily life. She wanders the house, occasionally doing activities like exercising, reading, brushing her teeth, feeding herself, sleeping, or even playing a game on her Famicom. The time of day is tracked on an in-game clock, on which 5 minutes is only a few seconds in real time.</p>\n<p>Simple requests can be selected from the menu bar. These include making the phone ring, sending the girl a letter, sending her to purchase food or milk, feeding the cat, sending her a Famicom game as a gift, and having her perform a song on the piano. The girl only stores a few boxes of food and bottles of milk, and must be sent out to retrieve more before she runs out. If left neglected for too long, the girl will become angry, and may leave the house and never return.</p>\n<p>One option in the menu allows the player to have their fortune told by the girl. This can be done through a blood-type compatibility test, a horoscope, or a variation of tarot using playing cards.</p>",

Like the other games, the game takes place in a first-perspective with text options to select. A few times in the game you will have to click on things on the graphic screen with a pointer, but a majority of the game will be spent selecting actions from the menu. The game takes place near the middle of August. The dead body of a woman has been found and you must search for the murderer. To do this you must perform many tasks such as traveling to different locations and asking people what they have seen or heard about the murder. During the course of the game, the player may save their game at any point.</p>",

The program and the game itself deals with Tokugawa Mitsukuni, a seventeenth century Mito region daimyo, who had a legend around him that he traveled around Edo period Japan in disguise to visit cities in order to solve their problems stemming from corrupt magistrates, merchants and other ne'er-do-wells. On his adventures, Tokugawa is followed by his retainers Atsumi Kakunoshin and Sasaki Sukesabur\u014d, who in this game do most of the legwork. </p>\n<p>The game involves visiting seven different Japanese towns (levels): Hakone, Osaku, Kyoto, Kanazawa, Hirosaki, Morioka, and Mito. Players control one of the retainers (they alternate between levels) and have to get clues in order to solve the problem currently plaguing that town. Getting clues involves traveling around town and speaking to the right villagers. Collecting these clues will of course be impeded by enemies which the retainers have to deal with by either hitting them or doing their best to avoid them. Players only have a limited time to gather all the clues before the mission is considered a failure. Each clue they receive will fill a clue meter, and once it's filled the retainer can return to Tokugawa. At that point Tokugawa will reveal his true identity and hand out judgement on the guilty party, then it's off to the next town. </p>\n<p>Players can purchase items at the stores found throughout the town. Items include such things as straw hats that increase defense, sandals that increase walking speed, rice balls that restore health, hairpins to drive away Sunsoft's recurring character, Tami, a woman who clings to the protagonist and drains them of their energy, a talisman to defeat ghosts, a lantern to extend the time limit, and a log book which can be used to either receive a password or continue the game after death. Players can also visit restaurants that serve food in order to restore their health.</p>\n<p>Other items like the pinwheel and bowl allow the retainer to be changed into one of the support characters for a limited amount of time. The support characters Yashichi, Hachibei, Gin, and Matahei have abilities the retainers lack such as being able to jump. They need to be utilized as some clues can only be accessed by them.</p>\n<p>Earning money to buy these items involves playing mini-games found around town, such as one where the player has to shoot an arrow at a moving target.</p>\n<p>The cartridge came with a voice chip so players could hear the dialogue occasionally spoken to them in Japanese.</p>",

When the collision is unavoidable, the player will simply fall off. During competitive races the positions are not displayed on the screen or simply nonexistent, but once a course is finished the final standings screen (consisting of 20 names) will appear.</p>\n<p>Modes available are \"touring\" and \"grandprix\". In touring, the player can select four scenes, while in grandprix there are a total of nine courses to overcome. The first four are from all around Japan while the other five are located in European countries such as Yugoslavia and Sweden.</p>\n<p>The game was released along with a peripheral where the player sits on it and use the handlebars to control the on-screen motorcycle.</p>",

There are two main varieties of level, outdoors and indoors. All levels throw hordes of goons at Jack that respawn endlessly. He can defeat them by punching and kicking or simply evade them by jumping over them and continuing on his way. In outdoors levels, more enemies will usually be part of the background, like cops shooting their guns or homeless persons in trash cans throwing grenades. The indoors levels take place over several floors that Slater can move between by going through doorways. He also must sometimes punch in a door to continue. Most levels include several boss fights against major and minor enemies.</p>\n<p>The levels are all based on the film and include Slater's confrontation with the Ripper, Slater's home, and the film premiere. There is even a stage based on the film's dream sequence starring Slater as Hamlet (\"Hey Claudius, you killed my father. Big mistake!\"), complete with archers and knights as enemies.</p>\n<p>Small scenes between levels tell the story, some of which feature digitized images from the film.</p>",

Along the way you can visit castles and towns to get helpful advice by the townspeople. When in combat, the game is automatic, as you can only control your actions on the map screen. Your robots are given a limited supply of ammo and only one can be refiled each time it's your turn. If you lose, you are given another chance, but if you win, you will gain powerups for your robots. You can also save your game after winning. On the overworld screen you can several different routes to get to Gionkia's castle.</p>",

Original Mario Bros. is the classic game, upgraded to more resemble the original arcade version. You can now also change direction in midair, and new levels were added, as well as the ability to save your score. Between levels are cutscenes and advertisements for Japanese food company Nagatanien (the game's sponsor), Super Mario Bros. cereal, and even other Mario games, including <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=super-mario-bros-3\">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>, released shortly before, essentially making this an advergame. The second mode, Nagatanien World, is similar, but once per game, after a game over, you may play a slot machine minigame. Depending on the number of matches, you can gain more lives and continue with your score and phase counters intact. When you reach 100,000 points, you get a get to enter a drawing to win Mario playing cards, and at 200,000 points, another code for a chance to win a copy of Super Mario Bros. 3. The third mode, Name Registration, allows both players to register their name, age, and gender for use when a high score is broken and for honorifics. The fourth mode, Notices, has a Shellcreeper explain the promotional features of Nagatanien World.</p>\n<p>The game was a promotional release, and was only available through the Disk Writer.</p>",

It is the brother game of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/17777/aussie-rules-footy/\">Aussie Rules Footy</a>. The player can choose from eight teams; Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and West Indies. Additionally there is a hidden team called The Beam Team, where each of the developers' portraits is represented by Sonic the Hedgehog. From the menu there are different types of play modes the player can choose from.</p>\n<p>Fast Game will start a game and randomly pick a team for the player and the computer. Single Match is a regular exhibition game in which the player chooses their team as well as the computer's team. The World Series is the main part of the game, where the player will select a team and will then go up against the other seven teams. The player can also choose the color of their team. There is also a practice mode where the player can practice batting or bowling. There is also an options screen where the player can set the number of overs, enable or disable the bowl screen, turn music on or off, enable or disable the bounce cross, as well as computer aided selections.</p>\n<p>Before the game, the player must do a coin toss to see who will bat first, as well as where to place their teammates. In the batting screen, the game is seen from a 3rd-person view, but after the ball is hit, the game switches to a birds-eye view. Whenever a certain event occurs, a cutscene is played to represent the said event, such as Howzats, Out for a Duck, and Bowled Him.</p>\n<p>The game would later see a port on the SNES (titled <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/92340/super-international-cricket/\">Super International Cricket</a>) with altered gameplay.</p>",

The game allows you to play as Taison Maeda as well as three other characters, each with their own storylines. Most of the game takes place at the high school. Like most RPG games, you get an overworld map, but instead of walking to where you want, a menu on the bottom of the screen will let you select where your character goes to. The main goal of the game is to complete each fight. Doing so will take you to different areas of the game. The fight system functions like any normal RPG game, except it is viewed in the form of cutscenes. The game also contains a save feature with battery backup.</p>\n<p>Another <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Rokudenashi+Blues\">Rokudenashi Blues</a> game was released for the Super Famicom by Bandai and contains different gameplay from its Famicom counterpart.</p>",

Although he did them without so much as a complaint, he longed for the day where he finally would get an opportunity to prove himself. Now, that day has finally come. The Great Wizard has given Hao a task - recover six talismans located in six separate castles, and then he'll consider him a wizard. Is Hao up to the task?</p>\n<p><em>Hao Kun no Fushigina Tabi</em> pits a single player controlling Hao against 6 worlds of perilous obstacles, malicious enemies, and devious mazes. Within those 6 worlds, Hao must find the six talismans (once per world) while negotiating the dangers of the outside world, castles, or even underground dungeons. Along the way Hao can give himself more of an advantage by grabbing various items that can either help Hao uncover new passages or give him magical powers. But the items are placed in seemingly unreachable places, so Hao had better keep his eyes peeled.</p>\n<p>The game is over if Hao either runs out of health or falls into water without a SOS item present... or if he successfully recovers the six talismans.</p>",

The game includes six tournaments, including the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, and offers play on grass, clay, and hardcourts, as well as a unique \"cosmo\" surface that takes place in outer space with astronaut ballboys.</p>\n<p>There are three modes of play to choose from: exhibition, tournament and world tour. Exhibition mode consists of a single exhibition match for one or two players, while Tournament mode allows up to eight players to face off in a singles tourney. Both of these modes also include a \"Watch\" option, in which all players are controlled by the computer. World Tour mode takes the player through an entire year on tour playing against computer-controlled opponents, using a password save system. Doubles matches aren't available in any mode though.</p>",

Player's health on the left of the screen is represented by baseballs (when playing as Batsu) or bats (when playing as Ter\u012b). The game is started with one health point but it can be increased up to five by killing enemies. If you have at least two health points you can change between the two heroes by pressing the jump and select buttons together. Destroying certain blocks can reveal heart icons (collect 100 to gain a 1UP) or POW which increases weapon power. The goal is to simply reach the end of the stage before the timer runs out.

This game is believed to be the first unlicensed cartridge for the Nintendo Famicom, and also the first adult title for the system. In the game, you control a short man similar in stature to Mario. You are chasing a woman, who is apparently playing \"hard to get.\" Your goal is impeded by a dog, who runs around, following your movement, trying to block your way. When \"Maruo\" finally catches the woman, an animation of her stripping is played. The game then resumes, only now neither the woman nor \"Maruo\" are wearing any clothes. When he catches her again, a looping animation of the two having sex plays (a very simple animation of the woman being penetrated by a disembodied penis). When you press a button, gameplay starts again. The next strip scene is always the same, but there are four different sex scenes (including the first). After the last sex scene, the entire game is repeated until the player turns off the system.</p>",

You start with your fists and grenades, but soon obtain a sub-machine gun which can be upgraded to spread shot and even to rocket launcher. The upgrades are usually located in breakable crates.

        "description": "<p><em>Ky\u014dry\u016b Sentai Zyuranger</em> is an action platform game based on Japanese TV show of the same name which later inspired US TV series <em>Power Rangers</em>. As in the show, the villain witch Bandora is plotting an evil scheme and zyurangers set out to stop her. The game consists of five stages each ending with a boss fight. Each stage is assigned to one of five zyurangers. The ranger starts with a blaster, but by entering a door halfway through the stage he gets his respective legendary weapon. Legendary weapons are stronger than the blaster, but in most cases have limited attack range. If the player collects ten coins scattered in the stage, a picture of zyuranger's respective mecha is shown and the ranger's health is fully replenished. Between the stages the player is challenged to one of three possible minigames: a simple quiz, a pong-like game or a bomb toss game. These minigames can be selected and played from the main menu, with the latter two available for two-player mode. The game has a password feature.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Nagagutsu o Haita Neko: Sekai Issh\u016b 80 Nichi Daib\u014dken</em> is an action-platformer game based on a 70s anime movie starring a cat named Pero in a bet that he can travel around the world in 80 days, with the general plot being heavily inspired by the classic novel \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/61309/jules-verne/\">Jules Verne</a>. The game consists of eight stages each in a different place of the world. While some stages have you walking and jumping around in mostly side-scrolling scenes, there are also many stages that have you travel by different methods, like boats, a car, a submarine or in a balloon. Gameplay consists of jumping, dodging and shooting enemies, while you always have to try to make fast progress because there is only a limited amount of time to complete the game, and it means \"Game Over\" when the 80 days ingame time is over even if there are still lives left.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>19: Neunzehn</em> is a strategy game in which the player takes the role of one of four leaders in his fight for the possession of an ancient artifact, a stone left behind by the Olympian gods. The player can choose between one of the four leaders, which represent \"mountain\", \"forest\", \"sand\" and \"water\" each starting in their respective environment of the overworld map. Troops of each faction have different values in stats like melee or long-range attack and movement. When it comes to battle the screen changes to a single-screen hexagonal battlefield map. You have a certain amount of action points for each of your units. After you have determined your actions, the game executes each command simultaneously, so it is important for the player to anticipate his opponent's moves beforehand. By winning battles, your surviving troops get experience, eventually leading to a troop upgrade, which increases stats.</p>",

The game features a total of fifteen songs, each of them presented in a graphical sequence and with the song's text displayed at the bottom of the screen. The game features four different game modes. The first mode is a \"Lesson\" mode, where the player can freely choose a song to practice. In the second mode, the player performs on a theater stage to win a cup. The third mode is a sort of career mode, where the player has to sing in front of judges. The fourth and last mode is a quiz game, presenting the player glimpses of songs, which they have to guess correctly.</p>",

From here on out, the plot unfolds in a traditional Japanese RPG manner, involving a coming-of-age story with some world-saving in the mix. The game is divided into ten chapters, each portraying a different character, with all of them eventually coming together towards the end.</p>\n<p><em>Juvei Quest</em> is a Japanese-style role-playing game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dragon+Quest\">Dragon Quest</a> series. It follows the usual pattern of walking around villages, having an overworld map and several dungeons to explore, while also featuring a very similar battle system. Stand-out features include the use of maps that lead to hidden treasures, being able to recruit helper characters that can do useful tasks such as deactivating traps, and the ability to essentially purchase extra item slots. Among the more familiar elements are the turn-based battles, lots of different equipment to buy and find, and a vast array of different abilities from all party members (the game uses a skill system, instead of typical magic points for using special abilities).</p>",

The game can either be played alone, in which case the player takes control of blue haired Yuri, or in a two-player simultaneous mode in which the second player takes control of red-haired Kei. The game consists of four sections. Section one and three are straightforward auto-scrolling platform stages in which the player has to jump around and shoot incoming enemies. In section two and four the environment and gameplay change to a non-linear room-based maze-layout in which the player has to find disks in order to finish the section. Many rooms are locked and must be unlocked first by using bombs, key cards or other means.</p>",

The environment looks strikingly similar to the first <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3393/the-legend-of-zelda/\">The Legend of Zelda</a> game. The player has to avoid contact with enemies and push logs in order to solve math-based problems to get extra items.

They must help underwater creatures against a vicious medusa and finally enter the castle of the evil witch herself. The game includes many references and characters from classic fairy tales.

Sanada Yukimura gets send out by his father to find ten powerful warriors, which according to a popular Japanese legend would come to be known as the \"Sanada Ten Braves\" (\"Sanada J\u016by\u016bshi\"), to support him in the war.</p>\n<p>The game differs a bit from being a typical \"Dragon Quest\" clone by featuring a unique combat system. Instead of HP, Sanada Yukimura recruits troops by talking to enemies and persuading them to fight for him by offering the rations and weapons. Once he finds one of the ten special warriors, they join his party and become troop leaders as well. It is important to use the right unit type against enemies, because they all are strong or weak against certain enemy types. A samurai for example is strong against swordsmen, but weak against thieves.</p>\n<p>All members of the ten braves have special abilities which are crucial to progress in the game. One character can move boulders and trees, another one allows the party to sail with a ship and yet another one can be send out to retrieve important information, which is needed to trigger certain events to progress in the story and so on.</p>\n<p>Most of the time the party will move around the overworld to walk from one town to the next. Townspeople provide information. Towns are also needed to stock up with rations and weapons in shops. They also often feature a gambling house, where there is the possibility to bet money on the outcome of a cast of dice. Dungeons in the form of caves or underground passages are also present, but not as numerous or dominant as in many other Famicom RPGs of that era.</p>",

The Space Police Force (SPF) is tasked with seeking out the Evil Energy that constitutes Dryas and destroying the mechabeasts that he deploys to attack the human race whether in Earth or in space. </p>\n<p>The player at the start of the game gets to choose between two characters, Kenta, a special member of the SPF and grandson of Dr. Hiroshi Amano, the scientist that develops the mechs of the SPF; or the main character, Yuutarou Katori, the human identity of the space guardian known as Fighbird. </p>\n<p>The game has four stages with 3 phases: the first phase starts with the player selecting one of the members of the machine rescue team known as the Baron Team (which the player can swap with any of the vehicles anytime); the second phase starts the player with Fire Jet and performing specific tasks, like destroying or collecting certain objects, and the last phase is where the player plays as Fighbird himself and goes on to fight the stage bosses.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Seiken Psycho Caliber: Maj\u016b no Mori Densetsu</em> the player controls an unnamed hero, which legends say will rid the lands from the clutches of evil forces from the Dark World. The gameplay resembles that of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3393/the-legend-of-zelda/\">The Legend of Zelda</a> game. On his quest the player has to travel and fight his way through the game world which consists of nine overland areas and several dungeons. While its possible to go back and visit already explored and finished areas the game is a lot more linear than the aforementioned Zelda game.</p>\n<p>The player starts out with only a sword as a weapon. Better sword variants can be found and bought and it can eventually also shoot projectiles at enemies, not unlike Zelda again. Other typical items like health refills, ranged weapons, teleport items and a handful of special items that are needed to progress the story, are also incorporated into the game.</p>\n<p>In addition to a normal health bar, which gets reduced when the player comes in contact with enemies, there has to be paid attention to an extra counter that works as a sort of time-limit because it gets lower even when the player doesn't move or does anything at all. When killed, enemies might leave an item behind that increases the counter as well as the chance for a money increase. Money is used to buy stuff from shops which can be found scattered throughout the areas.</p>",

        "description": "<p>An F-1 racing title featuring three game modes. The Warming Up mode lets the player practice five laps on one of the sixteen tracks by themselves. Battle mode lets the player compete against another player or a computer controlled driver in a split-screen race (lasting from between one to ten laps depending on the length selected). Players can also watch a race between two computer controlled drivers. Grand Prix mode is the game's career mode. In this series of races, players must first run a fast enough qualifying lap to enter a race. The top four fastest qualifying results are the ones that are chosen to compete. After the four cars finish a race they each receive points depending on what place they finished in. These points keep getting added to the drivers total points tally. Having the most total points after a series of races is the ultimate goal.</p>\n<p>There are four F-1 cars that are available to drive. Three have manual transmissions (requires shifting of gears while racing) while one is automatic. They each have individual ratings in power, acceleration, and traction.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Aliens have taken over Chinaland and have taken the emperor hostage! Fortunately, the emperor's son managed to escape and tell the story of the land's sorry plight to Jack and Ryu, Chinaland's resident ninja masters. Now it's up to them to rescue the emperor and free Chinaland from alien invasion!</p>\n<p><em>Super Chinese 3</em> is an action RPG for one or two players. In a two-player game, player 1 controls Jack and player 2 controls Ryu. In a one-player game, only Jack will be playable, but Ryu can join in at any time and share Jack's experience level. Both Ninja Boys share experience points so that they remain at the same level. </p>\n<p>Jack and Ryu explore the world map in an overhead view. As with the previous <i>Super Chinese</i> game, random encounters with monsters will give them the option to flee or to fight. While in combat (which takes place in a side-scrolling perspective or across multiple rooms), the players can use the control pad to move Jack or Ryu and the button to either punch or do a somersault jump to damage enemies. Additional power-ups can also be found during the course of battles. The combat ends when either side is out of hit points. Successfully defeating enemies awards experience points and Sen money, which can be spent in the convenience store of each town to increase abilities and buy new weapons. Some of these include throwing stars, special martial arts techniques, swords, projectile attacks and other special powers. Towns also contain people who will give clues and information to Jack &amp; Ryu.</p>\n<p>When bosses are encountered, the game play changes to a turn-based system. In each turn, commands are given to Jack &amp; Ryu, which include usage of special items and skills acquired during the game, who then perform actions based on those commands. The enemy's turn takes place the same way. Again, the battle ends when either side is out of hit points.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Crime Busters</em> is a light gun game in which the player takes the role of a police officer and has to shoot bandits. The game consists of three stages: the street outside of a bank, a warehouse and the inside of a bank.</p>\n<p>The first stage has the criminals appearing either at the windows or at the door of the bank. In stage two the player has to face ninjas who will appear behind obstacles, running from side to side of the screen or hanging from the ceiling; some ninjas will hold hostages that should not be shot. Shooting the lights in the ceiling will make the room darker. Stage three has bank robbers hidden behind obstacles or running from side to side; hostages also appear on this stage.</p>\n<p>The player can choose a stage to start from. At first, the player has to shoot 20 enemies to progress to the next stage. Shooting all enemies sends the player to the next level with five more enemies to shoot. When all three stages are beaten, the game continues from the first stage selected. The player starts with 5 lives, which can be lost by taking three shots from the enemies or shooting hostages three times.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Hirake! Ponkikki</em> was a long-running Japanese children's program similar to <em>Sesame Street</em>; this game features the show's two main characters, Gachapin the dinosaur and Mukku the yeti, in a little friendly competition. Five mini-games repeat over the course of five islands, and each island must be cleared of all five games before proceeding to the next. The set-up is mainly intended for two players, with one player controlling Gachapin and the other Mukku. In one-player mode, either character may be selected, but the CPU will not compete at any game other than rock-paper-scissors. Players begin with a limited number of lives which may be lost by colliding with enemies or performing poorly at minigames; one extra life is also awarded at the end of each island. However, there is also a password system which allows the game to be resumed from any island.</p>\n<p>The minigames are as follows:* Platforming: Collect fruit while avoiding enemies in a slowly auto-scrolling platforming game. Whoever gets the most fruit wins.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shape Matching: Hurry to match the most shapes before time expires.</li>\n<li>The Shell Game: Pick out the spaceship with the other character in five rounds of the shell game.</li>\n<li>Rock-Paper-Scissors: Defeat the other character a set number of times at the classic hand game.</li>\n<li>Maze Chase: Race against the other player to collect the most candy apples before exiting. In later levels, avoid worms as well.</li>\n</ul>",

This original version of the game was still made available as a contest prize with reportedly only 1,000 physical copies being printed.</p>\n<p>Compared to the retail release the paradoxically named <em>Final Version</em> has several changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Complete absence of all side-scrolling stages. Instead of ending with boarding a space station or battleship stages simply end once all enemies have been destroyed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Only TITANS mecha appear as enemy units. The game also has a different intro to reflect the absence of Neo-Zeon mecha.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A more complicated UI that has an enemy radar</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enemies on ground maps are more aggressive and attack in greater number, but there are no items on the ground nor do ground maps transition into space maps.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p>This is the final installment of the <em>SD Gundam World</em> series to be released on the Famicom. The objective of the game is to conquer both Earth and space, by leading your army into battle against groups of rival armies.</p>\n<p>There are 10 preset scenarios in the game, each with a specified number of teams and a time limit to get the objectives done. (The player can also choose a Free Scenario.) Once a scenario is chosen, and game settings are set (all settings can be changed in Free Scenario mode), the player and computer take turns navigating units through a series of menus, in the hopes of gaining enough force to occupy a locale. Once a locale is captured, the player who took it over gains money which can be used to bolster their units. The first player to capture all 21 areas (or the player further ahead when time is up) wins the scenario.</p>\n<p>A battery-backed memory allows players to save their progress and return to the game at a later time.</p>",

During battles, enemies are positioned on top and allies on the bottom of the screen. When you choose to attack, the characters impact physically with each other and there is small animations when magic is used. Maximum of three enemies are displayable, two small ones and a medium sized one.</p>\n<p>The game is a pioneer in the \"RPG tool creation\" genre, like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8478/rpg-maker/\">RPG Maker</a>. There is an edit mode that allows you to edit some aspects of the game. For example you may choose a soundtrack (such as sci-fi or fantasy), or even create your own dungeons (max 8 of them) with enemies and treasure chests. In this edit mode you can also edit items stats, characters' aesthetics (just slight modifications from predefined sets), and stats of enemies. You may even change messages displayed in town shops and what's displayed during the opening and the ending.</p>",

Along the way you are accompanied by Saria, a light mage with access to various spells. The game controls like a Japanese-style adventure game with all actions selected from a text menu. Apart from the normal puzzle-solving gameplay, there are occasionally battles against monsters. These are also solved and won through menu commands, often times requiring the help of Saria's magic.

        "description": "<p><em>Millionaire</em> is a version of the popular board game Monopoly. The rules are pretty similar to the original, but the places in the board are the most noticeable difference. Instead of pieces of land with street names, the board features country names, such as Spain, Turkey or Switzerland. After buying such places, players can build houses or hotels.</p>\n<p>Another place called Wine Plant works the same as countries. There is a Forbidden Zone that sends players that land upon it to the Jail. Once in the jail, the player stays there for 3 turns (or before with a free from jail pass). In the Bank, shares can be bought and have their values increased or decreased and later be sold. In the Casino, a game of cups and balls can be played. In \"!\" and \"?\" places, players chose among three cards facing down, each card with a different effect, such as increase in stocks values, free from jail passes, or even fire that destroys all buildings. Finally, there is also an Insurance place, where players can buy insurance for their buildings.</p>\n<p>Up to four players can take turns in this game. Each one starts with 7.500 dollars, and leaves the board when there's no money left to pay the bills. The last player standing wins.</p>",

The aim is to collect all flags in a particular maze to proceed to the next one of the 75 available.</p>\n<p>There is a radar in the lower portion of the screen where players can see where the enemy cars and the flags are. The enemy cars are faster than the player, so it is necessary to try to lose them. If that doesn't work, players can leave smoke trails behind that will stop the enemy cars. These trails take fuel away; the car can be refueled by taking the flag with a L beside it.</p>\n<p>Players can also collect food items which will earn them money. Running over animals make the players lose money. This money can be used to buy upgrades in a shop, accessible by pressing Start. The upgrades available are Turbo (speed boost), Gun (shoots enemy cars and stuns them), Saver (slows fuel consumption), Wheel (makes the car turn faster), Bumper (allows running over some obstacles), Secret (turns the car into a ghost, allowing for running through enemies), Rocket (shoots enemies and destroys them) and 1-Ups.</p>",

This game opts for a more <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7303/metroid/\">Metroid</a>-inspired style and even adds a tune constantly looping while playing the game.</p>\n<p>The player takes role of a being that's sacrificed its body in order to take control of the bodies of the deceased Holy Warriors of Light, the only ones capable to defeat the forces of hell. The goal is to rescue the princess of heaven, imprisoned in the fortress of hell and the only way to get to her is by collecting 5 idols.</p>\n<p>The Family Computer Disk System version of Relics changes the story and limits the way the body swapping mechanic works by making the player collect amulets and fight specific bosses to switch bodies. Players can also cause damage to the walls which could reveal secret areas containing keys, health restoring items and power-ups.</p>\n<p>While looking very impressive for a Family Computer Disk System game, due to the hardware limitations, the game suffers from frequent loading of the areas and the enemies in an area. The collision detection can be inaccurate and it will be necessary to swap the sides of the Disk Card every time the main character dies and even during some of the levels.</p>",

The main overworld display is the standard top down view of most JRPG's, complete with random battles. Once you engage your enemy the perspective switches to a side view where you pilot your mech and battle against monsters.  It's fast and fluid and all played out in real time, with jump and attack mapped to your A &amp; B buttons.</p>",

To thwart the invasion, a humanoid robot is sent out to blast the aliens away.</p>\n<p><em>Cosmic Epsilon</em> is a 3D forward moving shooter. It uses the Famicom 3D System to give it 3D effects. Players alternate levels with their robot character in either flight mode or in humanoid mode. There are a variety of settings for each level.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is similar for both types of levels however. Players move all around the screen area and can attack the enemies coming from the background into the foreground. The player can shoot them with homing missiles or with the default Vulcan beam. The Vulcan Beam can be charged up for extra damage. Powerups can be collected from defeated enemies.</p>",

However, the NES version is quite different: there's no first-person shooting level; instead, the first level is an exclusive side-scrolling stage. All levels feature slightly different designs, all bosses are redesigned as well, including the tank boss and final boss battle, in which Robocop has to do something entirely different than destroy the ninjas.</p>",

While Yoshi was checking out this museum, he was captured by Bowser. Now it's up to Mario to rescue Yoshi and return the stolen objects back to their rightful place. </p>\n<p>The game consists of Mario defeating enemies in a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7301/mario-bros/\">Mario Bros</a> style game. Once all the enemies are defeated, they drop a stolen item which Mario needs to pick up. Mario then enters into a Timulator (a time traveling machine) and warps to the player's selected time period. The selected time period is basically a small side-scrolling area where Mario has to find the correct location to drop the current item he is holding. If Mario drops the item in the wrong location or the wrong time period, it will be taken away and Mario will have to restart the item collection process all over again. This side-scrolling section also holds the educational aspect of the game as Mario can jump into message blocks and learn factoids about the time and location he is currently in.</p>\n<p>The game will have Mario returning fourteen items (one for each time period) before he will be made to take a history exam about the knowledge he has gained from all this item gathering. Once that's finished Mario will finally be able to confront Bowser and rescue Yoshi.</p>",

The players now completed hand will determine their final score as their score from pinball will be multiplied by the strength of their hand. </p>\n<p>As in a typical pinball game, players shoot the pinball into play and then take control of a pair of flippers trying to keep the ball in play. The pinball table itself is car-themed, for example the table has the letters C-A-R and also has a gas stand slot machine. The table is made up of six screens with some parts accessible by getting the ball into a certain location. Some of the screens have their own goals to rack up points such as destroying UFO's with the pinball.</p>\n<p>Players start with three pinballs and can earn more pinballs with high scoring play. The game can also end when the player loses all of their pinballs.</p>",

        "description": "<p>One evening as Jajamaru and Sakurahime where watching a rare meteor storm, they witnessed a UFO crash land just beyond a nearby mountain. Inside the vessel they discovered the Great Galactic King. The king claimed the evil Don Destroida had just transformed his precious star into a mechanical planet filled with fearful robots. Our heroes than decide it is up to them to save the universe from Don Destroida and his robot horde. Jajamaru and Sakurahime are granted hammers by the Great Galactic King before taking off into space with the king's ship.</p>\n<p>In this <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/9532/ninja-jajamaru-kun-series/\">Ninja Jajamaru-kun</a> game, users can play either as Jajamaru or Sakurahime. <em>Ninja Jajamaru: Ginga Daisakusen</em> is somewhat of a departure from previous 8-bit entries in that it draws some design elements from other contemporary platformers creating a different feel when compared to older games. Character sprites are bigger and more cartoonish. Players jump on top of enemies to defeat them. A myriad of powerups can be found inside of blocks scattered across each level. A new status bar on the bottom of the screen displays various information such has remaining lives, currently active powerups, etc. In certain levels, pipes can be used to access sub-areas.</p>\n<p>Aside from general platforming gameplay <em>Ninja Jajamaru: Ginga Daisakusen</em> has a somewhat unique multi-staged running mechanic dubbed the \"reservoir dash.\" While standing still users can hold the B button to build up power. This power can then be released to run at high speed. It also allows the player to jump higher and further than normal. This is often required to make it across large gaps, or get over tall obstructions. At at full charge the character will begin somersaulting. This allows the player slice throw enemies while airborne, make jumping through hectic areas a bit easier. If the player sits and charges the reservoir dash to long the character becomes exhausted and temporarily can't move, leaving them exposed to attack. The rate at which charge is built varies between the two playable characters. Jajamaru can built up dash faster, while Sakurahime can higher jump power while dashing.</p>",

The game consists of two missions, selectable from the title screen, where he has to collect 20 crystals.</p>\n<p>The missions consist of several single-screen rooms connected vertically and horizontally so there is free exploration to collect the crystals in any order. He can fly around with an unlimited amount of fuel using a jet pack. Movement is based on thrust, so the player can either keep a button pressed to keep rising or use small taps to hover and navigate small passages. He can fly through platforms but will land on them when landing from above. There are hazard and enemies in irregular patterns to avoid. Paco has no means to attack, the focus is on careful navigation using the jet pack mechanic. He starts with ten lives and no additional ones can be earned. The HUD shows how many crystals are left to be found.</p>\n<p>Next to the free download release there was an exclusive crowdfunded release with the game on a NTSC/PAL cartridge. Based on the tier different extras were provided such as having your name listed in the game's credits, a full box and manual instead of just the cartridge, a full box and manual with the cartridge and signed by the authors, a surprise NES homebrew cartridge with a game from another developer, physical versions of the ZX Spectrum games <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/130745/uwol-quest-for-money/\">Uwol: Quest for Money</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/132489/goku-mal/\">Goku Mal</a>, become the protagonist in the game with a modified game sprite, a Mojon Twins T-shirt or access to the NES mold used for the cartridge.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mojonian Tales</em> is an anthology of more than 20 games created by the Spanish group Mojon Twins brought together on a single NES cartridge. It contains a mix of older games that were previously available and are now refurbished or reprogrammed, NES ports of existing games for other platforms and entirely new games that were previously never available. There is a broad mix of genres such as action games, platformers, shooters and puzzle titles. Next to what is available right away there are also several hidden treasures and easter eggs even leading to complete games that are not advertised. The hidden games are accessed by entering code through an option in the main menu and the codes are revealed in several ways.</p>\n<p>The release is only available on a cartridge and through a mail order, either as a loose cartridge or in a bitbox case with a full cover. It also includes a colour manual. The cartridge comes in three colours: grey, red and green, with the latter limited to 100 copies. It is compatible with both NTSC and PAL.</p>\n<p>Some of the included games are:<em> </em>Cheril... in the Cave*</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Cheril Begins</em></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/132161/cheril-of-the-bosque/\">Cheril of the Bosque</a></li>\n<li><em>Cheril in Another Bosque</em></li>\n<li><em>Cheril the Nine</em></li>\n<li><em>Dark Yun</em></li>\n<li><em>Dire Job!</em> (<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/132235/trabajo-basura/\">Trabajo Basura</a>)</li>\n<li><em>Espinete's Big Trouble</em></li>\n<li><em>An Incredible Customizer</em> (used to find some hidden games)</li>\n<li><em>Jet Puri Begins</em></li>\n<li><em>Jet Puri II</em></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/145047/journey-to-the-centre-of-the-alien/\">Journey to the Centre of the Alien</a></li>\n<li><em>Mega Meghan</em></li>\n<li><em>Monoma Ninona Pana</em></li>\n<li><em>The Rendezvous</em></li>\n<li><em>Sgt.

She is a little bored and when her teacher is away for a few days, she decides to try an enter the Sky Palace. It is a dangerous place her teacher has warned her about, but she wants to try to enter it and collect the three power gems that are hidden there. First Lala needs to locate her teacher's magic wand. This is done in the first stage which is the closest to the original game. Lala can move around freely, but has no means to attack. She has to complete platforming sections and avoid enemies to collect eight potions to become stronger and locate a key that opens the teacher's locked dungeon. Horizontally the screen scrolls but vertically the game uses the fixed-screen flip system of the original game to connect rooms. She starts with three lives and a single collision with an enemy or a hazard such as spikes removes one. Every now and then she can find a heart-shaped lollipop that restores a life.</p>\n<p>Once the wand is discovered Lala can start the second stage with new gameplay mechanics to reach the Sky Palace. She can swing her wand and another ability allows her to create a temporary platform in the air, but only one at a time. This mechanic is often used to cross large gaps. Lala can also use it quickly in succession to climb anywhere. Stage three is about locating the three power gems. Each room in the palace has a door that is opened with a switch and there is time pressure. When the sun sets, visible through changes in the sky background, everything will get darker until it is pitch black. Eventually the palace disappears complete. Doors you have opened remain open so you can progress faster for a new run.</p>\n<p>In the last stage Lala needs to collect coins and when all of them are collected an invincible ghost is released, chasing her relentlessly across the entire level. Waving Lala's wand is needed to scare the ghosts away. There are cut-scenes that further the story between levels.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>W\u01d2 xiang ni\u00e0o ni\u00e0o</em> is a deliberately difficult 2D side-scrolling platform game created for the 2016 NESdev comptition. It consists of four main levels with two parts each. In each level the girl Lin Lin needs to navigate difficult platform sections while collecting flies. She needs the flies to please the Frog King so he gets out of the way and Lin Lin gets to use the toilet, which ends the level. If Lin Lin has collected at least eight flies when she reaches the king, she gets to play a bonus level where any flies she collects are carried over to the second part of the level. The second part is more difficult each time because it is auto-scrolling and Lin Lin needs to advance quickly. Each level has a different theme introducing new challenges such as bouncing blocks for instance.</p>\n<p>Lin Lin has no means to attack. Next to the jumping the only action she can perform is a butt stomp which launches her off an enemy. This technique with careful timing is most often used to cross large gaps, used as a double jump technique. She starts with three lives and when a life is lost the entire level is restarted until she picks up a piece of poo which acts as a checkpoint. A life is lost right away when falling down a gap, but when she touches an enemy she only loses her clothes and can continue. A second hit is then fatal unless she finds an item that brings back her clothes.</p>",

Players control a boy who explores the underground cave system of Orudoora. The boy can jump, duck, and throw bombs to dispose of enemies. The game consists of 31 areas. In the first 10 areas players have to locate an inner tube, an oar, and an onigiri. Finding them will allow the player to advance further into the game. In the next 10 areas players will have to find the items again in order to advance in the game. Then once again for the third and final time, players will have to find the items again in order to move on and face the final boss. In order to exit an area players have to hit a Goblin enemy who will initiate a math problem. Players have to answer three of these math problems correctly to be allowed to leave an area.</p>\n<p>The second game is called Step Drill in which players race a motorcycle through Europe. To get a good time, players have to answer 39 math problems in total as fast as they can.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Yun</em> is a 2D platform game starring the eponymous character. She is a demon who, in a rare occurrence, hatched out of an egg of the rare Romani Heron in the boggy marsh near of the shores of Lake Poto\u00f1a in the Province of Badajoz. As a newborn and in the dark as she was born at dusk, she ate the first things she found in her surroundings, which happened to include a tube of toothpaste carelessly thrown away. This provided her with the ability to blow bubbles from her mouth, which she developed to capture animals inside. Just a few months later she founded her own Japanese restaurant near the marsh. One night she was about to capture a big and shiny orange fugu fish, but falls in love with it. Unfortunately the fish knew about her profession and escaped. A dejected Yun decides to change her ways: instead of serving raw fish to customers, she will serve customers to raw fish.</p>\n<p>The game contains three levels that consist of single-screen rooms connected both horizontally and vertically using the flip-screen mechanic offering freedom to explore in any direction. To complete a level Yun needs to capture all creatures she can find to fill her restaurant's pantry. The three environments are the marsh woods, an abandoned factory and finally a desert. Yun can blow up to three bubbles one after another. After they are launched they rise automatically, either disappearing from the screen or hovering below an obstacle until they disappear. Yun can use her own bubbles as a platform to reach higher places. The creatures need to be captured that way as well: once trapped Yun can simply touch them to make them disappear. The game shows how many creatures are left to be found.</p>\n<p>Yun has a limited amount of lives and any collision with a creature, a hazard such as spikes, or an invincible ghost that chases her around the screen, costs a life. Extra lives are provided through giant red hearts. Certain passages are locked and first require a key to progress. Once all creatures has been captured the level ends right away. A lot of sections require careful platforming.</p>\n<p>The game was started as a NES port of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/130798/cheril-perils/\">Cheril Perils</a>, but was turned into a separate game during development.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Cheril the Writer</em> is a game in the long-running series starring the eponymous character as the protagonist. This time Cheril heads to Pepinoni to spend her holidays and where she intends to start work on a book about retro video games. She has a meeting with her editor Amador who will supply the content of the book so she just need to copy and paste it. But when she arrives in Pepinoni everything is a mess. It is overrun by zombies so she has to clear the streets once again.</p>\n<p>This 2D platform game consists of several stages. They consist of multiple single-screen rooms connected both horizontally and vertically using the flip-screen mechanic, offering freedom to explore in any direction. There are several platforming sections to complete while avoiding enemies and hazards such as spikes. She has five lives and additional ones are provided by picking up hearts. Cheril has two types of jumps: a short one and a high one, depending on how long the button is held. To complete a level she needs to restore a temple by putting objects back in their original position similar to the mechanic previously used in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Cheril+the+Goddess\">Cheril the Goddess</a>. She encounters several objects that need to be carried to another location. But she can only carry one object at a time.</p>\n<p>Cheril initially has no means to attack, but a game mechanic previously explored in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/130781/mega-cheril-perils/\">Mega Cheril Perils</a> is revisited. Certain rooms contain a green device she can activate. The screen turns grey and a countdown from ten is started. During that period all enemies are frozen and Cheril can jump on top of them to take them out permanently. The effect is not limited to the room where the device is activated and it can be activated again. True to the series' legacy certain sections are guarded by an old man. Instead of a key Cheril needs to locate and bring him a piece of lingerie so he will let her pass.</p>",

One day Cheril hears about the three legendary stars of power. She grows curious and wants to find out more, when a strange man appears behind a huge pot. He tells her she needs help to reach the stars, but with a proper vehicle. The next thing she knows Cheril finds herself enclosed in a huge boot that leaps by itself. Before she has the chance to ask what to do next, it leaps away.</p>\n<p>The game consists of several stages. Each stage is composed of several single-screen rooms connected both horizontally and vertically using the flip-screen mechanic, offering an amount of freedom to explore. To complete a stage Cheril needs to collect twenty coins scattered around the level. They can only be collected completing difficult platforming sections. The boot jumps by itself, so the player only steers left and right. The height of the jump can be made shorter however by pressing down.</p>\n<p>Cheril can attack enemies by charging and releasing spit. This does not kill them, but pushes them away slightly. Enemies can be used as platforms by landing on top of them and this will alter their movement pattern. That way both techniques can be used to improvise with the level lay-out, getting enemies out of the way or in a favourable position. There are spikes to avoid and enemies cannot be touched from the side or below, or she loses a life. Cheril starts with five lives and additional ones are earned by picking up red hearts. Certain sections are locked and first require a key to be found.</p>",

However she needs a jewel to help her achieve her dream. So now it's up to the player to help her fulfill her dreams.</p>\n<p>In <em>Cocona World</em>, players take control of a witch named Cocona. The game revolves around maintaining three different meters for Cocona. A magic meter that drains when she attacks with her magic wand and can be refilled by locating a fairy. A mood meter which can be filled by completing Cocona's requests (play bingo, swim in the hot springs, fish, etc...) in a timely manner. Her mood will drain if her requests are ignored or if she is made to attack non-hostile animals. A strength meter which slowly drains naturally over time and can get drained from getting attacked by a hostile animal. It can get refilled by eating, sleeping, and using the hot springs. If either her mood or strength meter are totally empty the game will end.</p>\n<p>The game has a clock which tells what time of the day it is. Besides having to do Cocona's requests within a time limit, players have to be wary of the time since certain items can disappear over time and Cocona can only go to sleep at her house after a certain time which will bring her to the next day in game. For every day that passes, Cocona's meters can be filled to a higher level to a maximum of ten points which can be achieved on the sixth day.</p>\n<p>The game also has shops where Cocona can spend her treasure she found at a treasure cave or received from defeated animals. Shops carry food and other items to buy.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Espitene</em> is a 2D platformer inspired by the 2D <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Sonic+the+Hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> games created for the 2018 NESdev competition. As a fangame it uses many familiar elements in both visuals and mechanics. Some of the levels were previously featured in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/132546/mojon-twins-gran-sabiduria-31-in-1-real-games/\">Mojon Twins Gran Sabidur\u00eda: 31 in 1 Real Games</a> for the six games based on <em>Sonic</em> as the parodies <em>Sonic Mal</em> and the variants with a female character <em>Espinette</em>. This release is much more fleshed out compared to the shorter versions released previously. It contains twelve full stages divided over different zones as well as six boss stages.</p>\n<p>The story frames the game as part of the <em>Cheril</em> series. The recurring character in many of the developer's games find a mysterious puppet. When she examines it she knows she has a mission. She dresses up as the puppet wearing it as a costume and that way she becomes Espinette who needs to defeat the evil Somari (a spoof of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Mario\">Mario</a> from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/12052/somari-the-adventurer/\">Somari the Adventurer</a>, replacing Robotnik as the boss) and finds the six emeralds of Podewwwr.</p>\n<p>The player guides Espinette through levels with platform elements. The environment consists of single-screen rooms usually connected horizontally, but sometimes also vertically, using the flip-screen mechanic, offering an amount of freedom to explore. Typical challenges include crossing gaps, avoiding spikes, defeating enemies by jumping into them while spinning, using launchers, moving platforms, disappearing platforms and so on. Espinette can collect rings and when she is hit a single ring remains. When it is picked up again quickly Espinette regains protection against another hit. This can be repeated indefinitely. Sometimes additional lives can be found as well. The height of the jump depends on how long the button is pressed. When jumping in a regular way, without spinning, Espinette is vulnerable and cannot take out enemies, just like Sonic.</p>",

In each dream one or two daughters (called 'maids' in the level) need to be located and freed to end the level. Cheril moves through several single-screen rooms connected using the flip-screen mechanic. She can move around, shoot with an unlimited amount of bullets and push certain objects.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it is sufficient to get rid of enemies such as skeletons that appear from a spawning points or ghosts that can move through walls to reach the daughters. More often solving environment based puzzles is required. Certain rooms have one or many statues that need to be pushed to their pedestals. Once all of them are in position a passage usually opens to a next room. The room lay-out with many obstacles can be challenging and a wrong move often has Cheril stuck unable to solve the puzzle. She then has to leave the screen in order to reset all the statues and start over.</p>\n<p>Some rooms lead to multiple paths, to first find a key to open a gate or to locate more daughters. Each dream introduces new challenges, puzzle elements and hazards. One dream for instance has orbs that need to be shot to light and activate them. Some rooms have gaps, spikes or slippery tiles. Jumping can be used to cross gaps or to pass some hazards. An encounter with an enemy or a hazard immediately removes a life and finding a new life only happens every now and then.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Cheril the Goddess</em> is a 2D platformer made for the 2016 NESdev competition starring the developer's recurring character Cheril. In this title Cheril can become a goddess if she manages to obtain the Skull of Podewwwr. To reach it she must open three gates and unlock a magic column.</p>\n<p>It shares its name with the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Cheril+the+Goddess\">2012 ZX Spectrum title</a> and borrows a core element that Cheril must collect three items and bring them to the correct pedestal based on the Rock, Paper, Scissors principle. She can carry only one item at a time, so if she hunts down the Stone she must takes it to the Scissors shrine to open the first gate. The game consists of a single, large level where the environment consists of 2D horizontally scrolling rooms combined with the flip-screen mechanic for vertical movement. There is a large amount of freedom to explore freely and to complete the tasks in any order. The Select key is used to bring up a level map where all important locations are shown. After unlocking the three gates a key needs to be found as well to get past the magic column. The map is updated based on progress.</p>\n<p>The game uses another game mechanic not part of the 2012 title, but previously featured in the prototype <em>Vesta Vaal</em> part of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/132546/mojon-twins-gran-sabiduria-31-in-1-real-games/\">Mojon Twins Gran Sabidur\u00eda: 31 in 1 Real Games</a>. Cheril has access to a shape-shifting feature that allows her to transform into a flying, invincible creature for a short time. That way platform sections can be navigated quickly. When in regular form Cheril can only jump and has no means to attack. That means she can only avoid enemies (and some will chase her) and there are hazards to avoid as well. Cheril has three charges to briefly turn into the other form and then she needs to locate a pedestal with two hearts engraved to recharge. These charges can also be used to activate teleporters on different parts of the map.</p>\n<p>Cheril starts with five lives and every collision with an enemy or a hazard makes her lose a life. Every now and then a heart can be picked up for an extra life. When dead you lose the item you are carrying, but otherwise progress is saved, so if one gate is already open the game picks up from that point.</p>",

It stars the characters Espitenen (very similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Espinete\">Espinete</a> character) and Herr Pimponen, with three game modes. The game can be played solo, going through the ten stages in a fixed order as one of the two characters, a cooperative two-player mode and a competitive two-player mode.</p>\n<p>Each level consists of a large vertically oriented environment with platforms. The goal is to reach the top of the stage or to finish with most points. The characters start at the bottom and after the initial platforms the screen starts scrolling vertically at a fixed speed. If a character touches the bottom of the screen a life is lost right away. Quick jumping is required to keep progressing while collecting items for points. Both enemies can shoot in the opposite direction they are facing. They cannot hurt each other, but enemies can be taken out that way. The characters can however hinder each other, through bumping. When not touching the bottom of the screen a number of hits can be taken and health can be replenished by picking up red hearts.

        "description": "<p><em>Cosmo Police: Galivan</em> for the NES is very different from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/53112/galivan/\">other versions</a> and a game that belongs to the Metroidvania genre, being primarily a Metroid (NES)-style game with a few RPG elements added to the formula such as an experience point-based leveling system, melee weapons that grow stronger through usage and NPCs that hand out gameplay clues. </p>\n<p>The player explores an interconnected world in a sci-fi setting which gradually opens up as one gains new abilities (such as the late game jet boots which let you fly temporarily with each use, and some special weapons which let you open new paths by destroying walls), destroys computers and beats bosses. The abilities all cost energy (called CP in this game) to use. </p>\n<p>Interestingly for the time and platform, the game features an auto-save feature that triggers at certain points. Loading a save makes your experience points go down to the minimum for your current level while your main weapon's (the blade) level stays the same.</p>",

An object called the Golden Spike of Power keeps both dimensions balanced in harmony. It was placed on top of the Ocean Hotel in Las Vegas for safekeeping. However a doodle named Holli Would want the power of the Golden Spike so she can become a real human, but in doing so may cause both worlds to come to ruin. She also ripped up a map into five pieces which shown how the tunnels connected between this world and Cool World. So now it's up to Detective Frank Harris to track down the map pieces and put a stop to Holli's plans.</p>\n<p>Detective Frank Harris can jump, crouch, and use weapons to dispatch Holli's henchmen. Weapons include a pen, eraser, and bombs. Other items include bottles (used in conjunction with the pen), hearts which give Frank an extra life, food items which give Frank energy, and special area specific weapons. The game is broken into four different areas (Main Street - Cool World, The Highway, Main Street - Sweet Place, and Countryside near Sweet Place), with each area containing a piece of the map plus a fifth area which takes place at the hotel where Frank has to defend the Golden Spike from being stolen.</p>",

Bugs has to contend with those rascals Daffy Duck, Sylvester, Wiley Coyote, and Yosemite Sam who intend to stop him from completing this task.</p>\n<p>The game consists of sixty levels. Bugs must collect all the carrots on a level to beat it. This is not as straight forward as it seems as levels are typically maze like with many stairs and pipes that have to be navigated for Bugs to find all the carrots. Also, while Bugs is trying to find his way he'll have enemies constantly chasing him. He can deal with these enemies by pushing heavy objects on top of them or find boxing gloves that let him punch his adversaries. Bugs can also find an item called Magic Carrot Juice which gives him temporary invincibility.</p>\n<p>This version should not be confused with the same titled <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5341/the-bugs-bunny-crazy-castle/\">Game Boy version</a> which has its own unique level layouts.</p>",

The number of dungeons has been reduced from ten to five, however the dungeons have been increased in size and feature redesigned layouts. Other differences include the game featuring a larger character sprite, scrolling instead of a flip-screen, and spell incantations are done with button presses instead of typing in words, among other changes</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>AO</em> is a homebrew puzzle game. Each of the 33 levels consists of a fixed, single screen environment where a brick needs to be guided to a goal pit (exit point) in a maze-like environment shown through a top-down view. The brick is controlled directly and the view is in 2D, but the player needs to think in 3D to solve the puzzle. The brick takes up two spaces when it is laying on its side and one space when it is standing up. To get around in the maze the brick often needs to be brought into a specific position so it can move without falling off the edge. For instance: some passages only have room for a single space and then the brick cannot pass unless it is in a good position. When falling off the ledge the level restarts right away and there are unlimited lives. Gradually additional elements are introduced such as switches, teleportation blocks and weak floors. The game contains a competitive two-player mode where two players move through the maze simultaneously with the goal to reach the exit first. The game provides 1,000 seconds to complete the game, but it is possible to continue playing even when time has run out.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Beerslinger</em> is a time management game with a concept similar to the arcade classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/298/tapper/\">Tapper</a>. It is the second game in the <em>Holiday</em> series by the developer, this time made for Saint Patrick's Day.</p>\n<p>The player controls a bartender who needs to serve customers in a pub. Each level is a different day and introduces two bars, one with the beers on tap and one where customers sit down and order. Based on the customer's order the bartender needs to fill up the mug with the correct type of beer (e.g. IPA, lager, stout, wheat) and serve it in time. A timer below the customer's stool shows the remaining time and if the bartender messes up three times by being too late or serving the wrong type, he is fired and the game is over. The goal is to make it through the seven days of the week. Each day also has a cash target.</p>\n<p>A single button is used to fill up the mug and then again to serve it. The second button is used to empty the mug when it does not contain the correct type of beer to get rid of it. The customers order using a voice sample expressing their choice in addition to the next on screen. Levels gradually get more difficult, introducing multiple types of beer and more room for patrons who also turn up faster. Starting with two kegs and two stools the game ends with four kegs and six stools.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Family Picross</em> is a homebrew picross puzzle game. It keeps the classic puzzle game formula using the numbers on top and to the left of each row and column to fill in the boxes. The player controls the cursor directly and moves over the boxes. A single button is used to toggle between the three box states: selected, crossed out or open.</p>\n<p>There are more than 100 puzzles to complete, starting from very small puzzles to large and complex ones. Options including entering a name, a selection between three music tracks, stopping the cursor at the edges or allowing it to wrap around, and the ability to continue using a password. A password is provided after completing each puzzle. The game also keeps track of the high scores as puzzles have a time limit. Completing puzzles in a short time provides more points. It is possible to continue playing and complete the puzzle even when time has run out, but that costs one of the three lives provided.</p>\n<p>The game is available as a ROM download and a successful Kickstarter campaign was launched to provide a cartridge version in three varieties: box, loose cartridge and a solutionist version with a solutions guide to all puzzles.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>NES Virus Cleaner</em> is a homebrew arcade game and a spoof of the NES Cleaning Kit. Players guide the hero Clik through the inside of a NES console to grab the viruses that appear in various locations on the screen. Each level consists of a single, fixed screen and Clik can be moved around freely. To complete the level and move on to the next one, a certain number of viruses need to be captured before time runs out.</p>\n<p>Clik is slowed down in his movement especially because of electric bolts, sparks, homing missiles and disappearing blocks in the environment. Clik has no means to attack and can only move, so a lot of evasion is required. When the character is hit it respawns in the location where the last virus was captured. To help Clik get around fast when almost out of time he can drop a teleporter at any location to quickly shift to that place, but at the cost of 1,000 points. Once deployed it is possible to cancel the teleporter to drop it in a new location.</p>\n<p>Each level is built around a component of the NES console with a brief introduction by Clik as a guide. The character also explains all the dangers in that level. Points are scored for every captured virus (50 points), but they also provide additional time. If Clik gets hit a life is lost as well as 100 points.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Log Jammers</em> is a homebrew arcade sports game. It is similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/145005/log-jammers/\">PC and console versions</a> of the same name and by the same developer. Those versions are not identical and described as an \"upmake\" of the NES version. The game borrows elements from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/16956/windjammers/\">Windjammers</a>, which served as an inspiration.</p>\n<p>Players select one of six characters from a cast with names such as Rad Carlton, Bruiser Bogardus, Hot Foot Francis, Sparerib Boneapart, Mayo Monsoon or Ollie Oilsack. There are also multiple environments and different game modes. The characters are described as lumberjacks. Matches take place on a fixed screen view shown from an elevated position. Characters are standing on rolling logs and throw an axe that acts like a ball.</p>\n<p>In a typical tournament different opponents need to be defeated one after the other. Points are scored by throwing the axe into the goal area behind the opponent. This zone is different for each environment. Sometimes there is only a single, large goal area, while another environment has three zones for five, two and five points respectively. In some levels like North Pool the middle part is entirely open, while in others like Mount Olympus the axe can only be thrown through a few open passages.</p>\n<p>The opponent guards these areas and attempts to catch or bounce back the axe to try the same on the other side. A set is won when someone reaches twelve points. The best of three sets wins a match. Special items appear during matches such as stars (use a signature throw different for each character), magnets (increase catching range for five seconds), ice cubes (decrease the opponent's movement speed for a short amount of time) and oil (the axe cannot be caught for five seconds and will bounce back instead, and at a reduced speed). There are counters for some power-ups. For instance, when the signature throw is caught by the opponent, their signature throw becomes active right away.</p>\n<p>The game supports competitive multiplayer against another opponent on the same screen. The game comes in a box with a green cartridge and a full colour manual.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Journey to the Centre of the Alien</em> is a futuristic homebrew 2D platform game starring Special Agent PDT-6. She is deployed at an unknown location on a secret mission. The game consists of several levels where strange eggs need to be located and picked up, before returning to the relay station at the starting position. Levels consist of several single, fixed screen linked together using the flip-screen mechanic and there is a small amount of freedom to explore and complete the level in a non-linear way.</p>\n<p>Special Agent PDT-6 wears a cybernetic suit that provides some abilities such as swimming, double jumping and using her bum to bounce off enemies without being hurt. Gameplay involves a lot of platform elements such as precise movement and timing to avoid enemy patterns. Enemies cannot be killed. Certain parts of the environment are also deadly, such as sharp stones and spikes in the floor. A single encounter with an enemy or a hazard immediately removes one of the five starting lives. Additional objects can be collected as well. The HUD can be used to track how many eggs need to be located. When dead, the agent respawns right away and when the game is over it is possible to restart the entire game or to continue the last level.</p>\n<p>The game debuted in the 2019 compilation <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/131344/mojonian-tales/\">Mojonian Tales</a>. The title references the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Journey+to+the+Center+of+the+Earth\">Journey to the Center of the Earth</a> and a spoof of that game was previously explored in the developer's 2010 <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/132166/viaje-al-centro-de-la-napia/\">Viaje al centro de la napia</a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Nomolos: Storming the CATsle</em> is a homebrew 2D side-scrolling platformer starring a cat in armour called Nomolos. The story starts when two cats, Solomon and Snow, are playing together when a portal suddenly appears. A giant purple arm shoots out from it and yanks Snow inside. Solomon follows right away and is transported, becoming the feline warrior Nomolos in the process. Going through twelve levels (with an additional hidden bonus level / warp zone) Nomolos pursues the purple enemy that is brining snow to the CATsle.</p>\n<p>In addition to the platforming there are many enemy types and three weapons, both melee and ranged. Power-ups can also be found and picking up a mouse restores a heart. The game contains five boss encounters and there are three difficulty levels selected from the main menu. The game music contains chiptune renditions of famous classical music composers.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Darkman</em> is an adventure game developed and published by Ocean Software. The title released in 1991 and 1992 for Gameboy, was also available for NES, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Amiga, ZX Spectrum, and Atari ST and was the first entry in a saga with two other titles.</p>\n<p>Similar to the movie of the same name, Darkman used to be a scientist exploring applications of a new synthetic skin useful for fire victims. The investigation was interrupted when a gang of mobsters entered his lab looking for a document, killing his assistant in the middle and leaving him seriously injured. At the same time, the scientist used a new surgical treatment that granted him immunity to pain, superhuman strength, but in exchange for intense impulses of anger and adrenaline. Thus, swearing vengeance against the gang of mobsters with a bandage covering his burned face in the criminal attack, Darkman was born.</p>\n<p>The game is a side-scrolling platformer at times, in which the main character must advance through the levels using masks of their victims, attacking enemies, and jumping obstacles. The masks are obtained in the photography mode, where the game changes to a first-person perspective and the user must photograph the criminal to copy his face. These mini-games of photographs are vital for the resolution of the platform levels since the duration of the mask in the next level will depend on the quality of the photos that the player takes.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Cheril in the Cave</em> is a 2D platformer originally created in 2017 but released for the first time in 2020. Players control the character Cheril in a series of caves presented as fixed-screen environments linked together using the flip-screen mechanic. The game is slow and requires precise platform jumping to avoid hazards such as blades and slime, as well as enemies. There is some freedom to explore as often objects such as a floppy disk are needed to activate a terminal elsewhere and proceed. The character starts with five lives and every encounter immediately removes one. It is possible to jump on top of characters, but this will not kill them. Certain enemies such as bats can be killed by luring them into slime. The game starts with a short tutorial.</p>",

His journey through a large game world ends bringing him into conflict with the clan of the evil Domes and a quest to save the world itself. Luckily, he's equipped with his trusty sword, which he can upgrade over the course of the game, and defeating enemies lets him collect little bits of fire which can be used as currency at shops. Players explore the world from a side-view perspective, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7296/zelda-ii-the-adventure-of-link/\">Zelda II</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9829/ys-iii-wanderers-from-ys/\">Ys III</a>; as they defeat bosses and explore dungeons, the world itself expands, giving them new places to explore.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This unlicensed rally simulation was initially developed by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=hal-laboratory-inc\">Hal Laboratory</a> and released in Australia in 1991, then ported to the Famicom by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=kaken-corp\">Kaken</a> in 1992 under the title <em>Exciting Rally: World Rally Championship</em>.</p>\n<p>The game is played from a top-down perspective, and the controls themselves are rather simple: button A allows you to drive at low speed, button B at a higher speed, and the down arrow doubles as brakes and reverse gear. Arrows will indicate some, but not all, turns, and you will have to keep an eye out for jumps and obstacles. Your car will accrue damage each time you bump into something, until it finally explodes and you have to retire from the stage.</p>\n<p>Two game modes are available. You can drive through an entire championship with up to seven other human players. Three classes serving as a difficulty setting, and the competition will take you to ten different countries, where you will have to compete against the times set by AI (and possibly human) opponents across several stages.\nOr you can play against two to eight other players in the Battle mode, setting a time one after another on your selected stage.</p>\n<p>There is some level of tuning, with the possibility of choosing your tyres according to the surface (tarmac, gravel or snow), whether you want a turbo, and between two and four-wheel drive for each stage. Once a lap, you can also change your tyres when the letters \"SP\" appear on the screen ; simply come to a stop and press Select.</p>",

However, an alien species began attacking the humans, putting humanity's survival at stake. Though it was only a matter of time before Earth fell to the power of the enemies, the Earth's army commander issued an order calling all of the units dispersed around the colonized planets to return to Earth. The player takes the role of a young soldier who was stationed with the Rayieza unit on the planet Mars, and his journey begins as he makes his way back to Earth along with the other members of his unit.</p>\n<p><em>Ginga no Sannin</em> is based on <em>Chiky\u016b Senshi Rayieza</em>, a PC game produced by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Enix\">Enix</a>.

        "description": "<p>In <em>Dreamworld Pogie</em> you control Pogie the Fluffle, who first appeared in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/361/dizzy-series/\">Dizzy</a> game series as Dizzy's pet. In this scrolling platform collecting game, your goal is to travel through the 15 levels of Candyland, searching for the exit portals, whilst avoiding contact with the inhabitants. You can optionally collect sweets for points and stars, of which 100 will give you an extra life. Movement is simply left, right, and jump. You can use rising bubbles or mushrooms to reach higher places and collecting a 'Fizzola' temporarily gives Pogie extra speed and invincibility, useful if you want to speed run the level without bothering with the collecting. Touching any eggs you find will create a respawn checkpoint. There is no in-game timer, so it can be played at your own pace. There is an alternating 2 player option, whereby the 2nd player controls the female Fluffle, Rosie. In this mode, if you die you must collect all the stars again, unlike in 1P mode.</p>\n<p>This game was written by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/87923/philip-oliver/\">Philip</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/39325/andrew-oliver/\">Andrew Oliver</a> in 1992 but not released due to the publisher, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Camerica\">Camerica</a>, going into administration. The source code of an almost complete build was later rediscovered by the twins in 2011 and a prototype demo was created and released online. In 2016, Team Yolkfolk finished the game and a crowdfunding campaign for a cartridge version was successfully funded. The completed version was also made available for free online. It has since been included on the Oliver Twins Collection cartridge for the Evercade.</p>",

It appears the villains of the game are a parody of Konami. In gameplay terms the game is fairly straight forward, you make your way through six stages avoiding obstacles, shooting enemies and each stage ends with a boss fight.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Backgammon</em> is a video game adaptation of the millenniums-old board game of the same name. It was developed for Nintendo's Famicom Disk System peripheral, with supervision by the Japan Backgammon Association.</p>\n<p>The game offers several modes of play. The Demonstration and Training Play modes help ease the player into the world of Backgammon, as well as get a feel for the game's controls. Match Play is a standard exhibition match against the computer. Tournament Play is the main part of the game where the player must face off against increasingly more difficult AI opponents. Each mode has its own color scheme and music. If the player manages to beat the hardest AI in Tournament Mode, they are awarded a Certificate of Commendation by the Japan Backgammon Association. There is also a 2 Player exhibition mode available for play.</p>",

The main character has a limited, recharging power meter that is used to blow out puffs of air, which can be used to do multiple jumps in the air, or can be fired against enemies. Enemies are defeated by using the air puffs to push them into walls or into each other. If the power meter is fully discharged, Q Boy becomes exhausted and is unable to move until the meter has fully recharged. There are five worlds with four stages each. Each world ends with a boss fight and has a bonus stage where extra lives can be won.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Galf</em> is a retro throwback golf game that was originally part of the 2017 golf game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/96493/golf-story/\">Golf Story</a>. It was released standalone as a fully functional NES cartridge in 2018. The game consists of nine holes and controls very similarly to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Golf\">Golf</a> on the NES. The holes feature a variety of typical golf course traps and hazards. The position of your ball, what type of grass you're hitting it out of, and the current wind speed all affect your ball's power and accuracy.</p>\n<p>As an additional bonus to the physical release, there is now a two-player mode, where each player takes their entire turn finishing the hole before the other player is allowed to tee off.</p>",

After building their base deep underground, amidst the ruins of an ancient human civilization, they launch their invasion a year later. A lone warrior must now journey underground to destroy the heart of the enemy base, in order to save Earth and the human race.</p>\n<p><em>Fire Rock</em> is an action platformer for the Famicom Disk System. In each of the six vertically scrolling stages, you have to defeat four bosses and find four key items to unlock the exit, while exploring a maze of doors and caverns. The barbarian-like protagonist is only armed with throwing torches, which can be upgraded to the eponymous <em>Fire Rock</em>. All walls are climbable, to help in the vertical traversal of the stages. One of the more unique mechanics is that collecting meat items increases your jump height, and higher jumps are sometimes required to reach items or progress to new locations in a stage.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Jeffrey Wittenhagen's Black Box Challenge</em> is a role-playing game similar to the Japanese RPGs that existed on the NES during its heyday. Like any RPG, the main character levels up and acquires new skills and items. Unlike most RPGs, the overarching goal is to acquire a complete set of NES \"black box\" games. As the player acquires each game, they can play a mini-game inspired by it on their in-game NES, and thereby acquire new skills to use in the main quest.</p>\n<p>The game had multiple releases and editions via Kickstarter.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Takahashi Meijin no Bug-tte Honey</em> is a side-scrolling action game that uses characters from the TV anime \"Bug tte Honey\" (1986-1987) based on the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6628/adventure-island/\">Adventure Island of Takahashi Meijin</a>.</p>\n<p>Takahashi Meijin has been kidnapped by the Great King Kyura and Honey, a bee fairy girl, has to rescue him. In the first stage of the game the player controls Honey who has the ability to fly and shoot heart bullets. After being rescued by Bug-tte, Takahashi becomes a player character in the second and later stages. He throws a stone ax to attack his enemies, but cannot remove obstacles like fire and rocks. That is only possible if he takes a power-up item for the third time to turn his weapon into fireballs.</p>\n<p>In order to defeat the boss of each stage, the player has to find eight hidden eggs to get the eight correct letters of the password that will unlock the doors of the final building. Unlike the later stages there is no boss to fight in the first one. Touching an egg will send the player to a Breakout/Arkanoid-like stage. Like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1087/arkanoid/\">Arkanoid</a> the player must keep a ball in play by manoeuvring a paddle beneath the ball so that it does not fall through the bottom of the screen. However, in this game, each paddle stage is composed of two screens aligned vertically and thus the player controls two paddles. That means if the ball passes from the bottom screen to the top screen or the other way around, the screen changes automatically.</p>\n<p>To complete these stages, the player must first collect the one correct letter from the four letters that may fall from one of the blocks after hitting them. The screen will flash white if the right letter has been collected. Then every block from the upper screen must be cleared to open the gate in the ceiling. Once the gate is open, the ball has to be shoot through it to get back to the action stage. Collecting the wrong letter instead, will make the screen flash red and the player will lose a paddle. This will also happen if the player miss the ball with the pad on the bottom screen. Losing all the paddles will reduce the remaining lives in the action mode by one.</p>\n<p>The player starts with three lives and a life meter, but there are no continues.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In London, the city of fog, on the night of March 16, 1895, a woman knocks on the door of 221B Baker Street, where Holmes and Watson are boarding. Her name is Veronica Norton and she wants to talk about her father, Professor William Norton. Professor William Norton, who has just retired from the British Museum, left his house for a walk yesterday morning but has not returned. Veronica, afraid something has happened to him, wants Sherlock to investigate.</p>\n<p><em>Meitantei Holmes: Kiri no London Satsujin Jiken</em> is the second instalment of the Towa Chiki's Holmes series and a Japanese adventure game in which all actions can be performed through a series of menu options displayed next to a static image of the current scene, (go outside, listen to the story, enter inside, look, search, call, show, take and ?), like many Japanese graphic text adventure games.</p>\n<p>The game is presented in first person with the exception when the \"go outside\" option is used. This brings up the movement mode; a 2D map where Holmes and Watson can travel on foot or by carriage to their destinations that have been revealed by clues or in conversations. When riding a horse-drawn carriage it brings up the adventure screen where you can select a destination. Then you will automatically reach your destination, but travelling by carriage costs money.</p>\n<p>If you want to talk to people you use the \"listen to the story\" option. To speak with Inspector Lestrade or Inspector Gregson you will need to send a telegram from the post office first before you can visit Scotland Yard to talk to them. This also costs money. If you run out of money, you will not be able to continue the investigation.</p>\n<p>The \"look\" option is to see where you are, who is there, or what you are doing. \"search\" will bring up a magnifying glass where you can go searching onscreen graphics for hot spots. If the person you want to speak to is not in the same room as Sherlock and Watson, but in the same building you can call them with the \"call\" option\". The \"?\" option is used to change characters; from Sherlock to Watson and vice versa to do things that can only be done by Holmes or things that can only be done by Watson. As Holmes you can use the option \"observe\" with a keen observation eye and Watson can only use the option \"Write a diary\" to save the game. The option \"listen to opinion\" can be used to listen to Holmes (Watson)'s thoughts.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In London, 1897, the famous violinist Gray Cornell approaches Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in the St. James Hall Lobby. He wants to talk about a threatening letter that he received that morning. The letter said \"I decided to get the famous violin instrument Stradivari that you have.\" The sender of the threatening letter is the villainous Professor Moriarty who is after the Stradivarius. Now at the request of Gray Cornell, Sherlock Holmes will accompany him on a violin performance tour in Europe to protect the Stradivarius.</p>\n<p><em>Meitantei Holmes: M Kara no Ch\u014dsenj\u014d</em> is after <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Sherlock+Holmes:+Hakushaku+Reij%C5%8D+Y%C5%ABkai+Jiken+\">Sherlock Holmes: Hakushaku Reij\u014d Y\u016bkai Jiken</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/174746/meitantei-holmes-kiri-no-london-satsujin-jiken/\">Meitantei Holmes: Kiri no London Satsujin Jiken</a> the third and final instalment of the Towa Chiki's Holmes series and a Japanese adventure game in which all actions can be performed through a series of menu options displayed next to a static image of the current scene, (Move, listen to the story, look, search, call, show, take and decipher), like many Japanese graphic text adventure games.</p>\n<p>The game is presented in first person with the exception when at certain points of the game the \"go outside\" option is used. These are the tracking scenes and bring up a 3D dungeon crawl mode where Holmes will travel on foot with the use of the cross key. The direction of each key corresponds to north (up), south (down), east (right) and west (left).</p>\n<p>If you want to talk to people you use the \"listen to the story\" option. The \"look\" option is to see where you are, who is there, or what you are doing. \"search\" is used to check the objects and items in that place. If the person you want to speak to is not in the same room as Sherlock and Watson, but in the same building you can call them with the \"call\" option\". The \"move\" option is when you want to go out or move to another place or room. When you have found evidence you can use the option \"take\" to add them to your belongings. \"belongings\" shows what you currently have in your possession. If you want to show the evidence to other people use the option \"show\". \"observe\" is to observe the person you have met for the first time with a keen observation eye. \"listen to opinion\" is to hear Watson's thoughts. \"decipher\" is used to break the codes that are dropped by Moriarty's subordinates.</p>\n<p>When the investigation in each country is complete, Professor Moriarty will tell you the password before going to the next country. If you enter this in the Continue, you can start the investigation from the next country. (it's by country) It is not possible to save in the middle of the investigation.</p>",

If the player goes past the original 52 card deck, they will get $50 subtracted from their total for each extra card they need.

Players can now make hands diagonally, the next upcoming cards can be shuffled to a few different sets, the addition of a joker card, and the freeze pause has been extended to 200 seconds.

        "description": "<p><em>Akuu Senki Raijin</em> is a hybrid shoot'em up and four directional mech shooting game for the Famicom Disk System. The story starts with a sudden attack by the machine form Galem in the five subspace relay points known as the \"Field\". As a respond and to get rid of the threat, the Galactic Union sends the mechanized mobile unit Raijin, controlled by the player.</p>\n<p>The Raijin's main gimmick is the ability to transform from a mech unit to a spaceship and vice-versa. Said transformation changes the gameplay from a shooting-adventure game with 4 directional movement and aiming through interconnected single-screen segments (similar to the first Legend of Zelda), to side-scrolling shoot'em up sections with fixed directions. The game also features upgrades in the form of different weapons and shields, which are purchasable along with their ammunition between levels.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>\"Monti no Doki Doki Dai Dass\u014d: Monty on the Run\"</em> is a remake of the 1985 original platformer and means <em>\"Monty's Great Heart-pounding Escape\"</em> when translated to English.\nIt was created for the Famicom Disk System in 1987 by Jaleco Ltd. The game bears very little resemblance to the original version. For instance, Monty Mole has been replaced with a human on the run from prison and now has to escape through various Aztec-like temples. The only real association the game does have with the original is Gremlin's copyright and the familiar \"in-game\" theme playing on the title screen. Like many Famicom Disk System titles, Monty's Great Heart-pounding Escape is little known outside Japan as the game was never ported to cartridge for a Western NES release.</p>",

Red monsters turn into yellow, yellow ones becomes green, and green ones vanish when they get pushed next to the stronger monster.</p>\n<p>Four bosses are featured in the game. The first three, in order, are the one in the form of paper, the one shaped like scissors, and the one looking like rock.

In the lore of the game, the player is trapped in a dream having become one of two animals: a hamster or a bird.  In the dream setting, the character's ability to jump is unpredictable.  The player must adapt to the controls and collect the four crystal shards in each stage.</p>\n<p>There are eighteen level layouts, each of which comes in a summer theme and a slippery winter theme.  Both playable animals are able to jump.  The bird can additionally glide around or flap to fly.  The height and duration of a jump are randomized by default, but in \"Lucid Mode\" they can be set by the player.  In the \"Three Dreams\" mode, the goal is to complete three stages, and falling into a pit results in the end of the game.  In the \"Full World\" mode, the player must complete all eighteen stages in succession, and falling into a pit simply restarts the current stage.  In either case, a successful completion will show the in-game time and icons to indicate which modes were played.</p>",

        "description": "<p><i>Best Keiba: Derby Stallion</i> is a simulation game which focuses not only on horse races, but on producing and training racehorses as well. Thus it has something from managerial game. The stage is a ranch, stables, and racetrack. Initially, it starts with one breeding mare and 15 million yen in funding. The first given breeding mare is of course the lowest class.</p>\n<p>Horse maintenance costs are 100,000 yen for each horse on a farm and 400,000 yen for each horse in a stable. This fee is collected at the beginning of each month. When the funds reach zero, the game ends with bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>Of the basic parameters of a racehorse, four are directly related to racing: speed, stamina, temperament, and competitive spirit. Furthermore, performance changes depending on factors such as sturdiness, fatigue recovery, condition, horse weight, and growth rate. If you have a bad temper, you'll be late, or you'll waste your stamina by moving ahead without following the instructions on the way. If you have a fighting spirit, it will be easier to win when competing in a straight line. If it is highly durable, it is less likely to break down during training or racing. There will also be fewer cases of athletes becoming unwell after a race. If you have a high level of recovery, it will be easier to overcome fatigue after a race, and you will be able to run tougher even if you run repeatedly at short intervals. The condition of a horse is what is called a biorhythm, and no matter how capable a horse may be, if it is put into a race when it is not in good shape, it will not be able to fully demonstrate its potential. Each type has a different peak time, with early maturing being around the middle of 4 years of age, normal being late 5 years of age, and late maturing around 7 years of age. Horses might by injured during races and in such cases they are excluded from next races. In extreme situations, when prognosis are poor, horse can be euthanized.</p>",

A front view window is also displayed at the same time, to help you to understand the structure of the cube. There are often few paths to clear the stage, but sometimes there is only one way to do it and then you will need to restart the stage on any mistake.</p>",

You just run around and hit bad guys until you find the stairs to the next level. In addition to your normal chain weapon, you can purchase shurikens, and in time you acquire many jutsu techniques.

Exploring on land or sea however can land Columbus into a battle. While combat is turn-based, its slightly more in depth as players have to take movement into account to get in range of their opponents. Columbus can eventually hire two crewmen to help him in these battles. </p>\n<p>The game has both a Normal Mode and the Historical Mode. The only difference is in Historical Mode, time is a factor. The game must be beaten before the year 1493 starts with time passing counted by every step Columbus makes. There is also a mode where players can practice sailing route missions of various difficulties.</p>",

There are magnetized red and blue blocks in each stage that interact with the player's character in opposite ways, depending on the player's character's polarity. Opposite colors attract, same colors repel. Picking up items change the player's polarity. The player can use the interactions with magnetized blocks to their advantage by boosting jump height or to climb across the ceiling. The game contains 100 stages.</p>\n<p>At the start of the game, the player can choose to play as a boy or a girl, which also changes the title screen accordingly.

Most notably, this version is no longer a Metroidvania since the ability to freely backtrack to previous stages has been removed, the stage progression is entirely linear.</p>",

The period of peace under his rule came to an end when demons took away the source of his power - the titular Light of Indra - and Byrn falls into a deep slumber, leaving the surface of the planet infested by monsters.</p>\n<p>Taking after <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9223/dragon-warrior/\">Dragon Quest</a>, this early Japanese-style RPG puts you in the shoes of a young warrior on Ival starting out on a simple quest to procure a remedy for his ailing Princess.

        "description": "<p>Sukeban Deka makes it way to the Famicom in the first and only game for the system. This game is an adaptation of the third season of the Sukeban Deka live-action TV series. The new yo-yo slinger to take up the mantle of Saki Asamiya is Yui Kazama. And this time, she is not alone. Joining her sisters Yuka and Yuma, they are tasked with combating a psychic terrorist and his army.</p>\n<p><em>Sukeban Deka III</em> gives you control over all 3 Kazama sisters from the TV show, who each have slightly different sprites. The game starts in an overhead free-roaming stage, but subsequently switches to side-scrolling perspective in the following stages. Though mostly a standard beat 'em up, the game has some light RPG elements. Each sister - who you can switch out as the active character at any moment - has her own level and ninja arts and they gain experience individually.</p>",
