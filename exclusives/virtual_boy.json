        "description": "<p>In the 22nd century a special form of robotics known as Telerobotics allows robots to mimic human body movements, has become prevalent. Dr. Edward Maki Jr., a prominent scientist in the field, has brought new life to the sport of boxing using this technology. Robots that are remotely controlled by human controllers now duke it out in the ring. </p>\n<p>Similar to the boxing game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Punch-Out!!\">Punch Out!!</a>, the player ducks to the left and right avoiding blows from the robotic competitor, getting jabs in when they\u2019re off guard. Each of the 8 or so opponents has a different weakness for the player to exploit. A special variety of \u201cMachine Gun\u201d charge attacks can be utilized to help the player make it up to the top of the Teleroboxer circuit.</p>",

However, rather than doing this by flipping an enemy upside-down from underneath and kicking them away, you throw shells at them. Also, taking advantage of Virtual Boy's added depth, there is a front area and a back area which can be traveled to and from using pipes. Shells can also be thrown at enemies on the other depth area.</p>",

If you ever stack over the five layers you will lose one of your layers, once all five are lost your game is over.</p>\n<p><strong>B.</strong> In this mode you place blocks around the center of the well, any blocks placed in the center will vanish, unless the block completes a layer in which case it will vanish.</p>\n<p><strong>C.</strong> In this mode a shape will be shown before the game begins. You will have to replicate this shape perfectly, even one block out of place and your game is over. Succeed and after a short animation a new shape will be given.</p>",

You must destroy all the enemies in the area, while preventing them from capturing the Atollers. If an Atoller is captured, you can still rescue it by destroying the Smoker before it leaves the playing area. Once all the enemies are gone, you'll be given a bonus based on how many Atollers you have remaining, and then move on to the next level. And, like old coin-ops, the game ends when you run out of lives.</p>",

But the treasure is guarded and soon he finds himself deep within the Earth as the floor crumbles underneath his feet. Now Wario must find his way back to the surface, all the while collecting the treasure he believes rightly belongs to him.</p>\n<p>This 3D style platform game, following the tradition of the Mario and Wario platform games of the Game Boy, will have you using Wario's unique abilities (butt stomping for one) to crash his way through the earth to the surface. His other abilities depend upon the hard hat he wears, and different ones are available that can come as an advantage.</p>",

Rotate blocks, and when you've formed a complete line they disappear. Mode A is the familiar endless mode of play, where you'll keep going until you've let the pile reach too high. Mode B is another common mode, where there are a set number of lines you must clear before victory is declared. Mode C is the most unique in this game. The game field is twice as wide, but you only use half of it at once; the other half is displayed further away in the background. You can scroll left or right at any time, creating new possibilities for creating lines and strategies.</p>",

Each mission in the game, which takes place after a text story segment, begins with both armies arranged on a square grid. The player can move their Gundams in close to attack, try to hit a target from long range, or hide in an attempt to ambush the enemy on their turn. If two units close to melee range then the game switches into a third-person action mode, which both units flying towards and away from the camera. Each unit has unique ranged and close range attacks, and is controlled by the player while fighting another MS, or controlled by the CPU when attacking capital ships.</p>",

Both games are available in their original format, although <em>Part II</em>'s multiple colors are lost seeing as how the Virtual Boy can't display any colors other than red. The two games are also available in a \"3D\" mode where the camera is tilted down 45\u00b0, although player and enemy movement remains unchanged. Finally two challenge modes are available for both games: Time attack, where the player is tasked with clearing a screen as fast as possible on a single life, and Score attack, where the player aims for the highest score possible on only three lives, with an extra life awarded every 1,500 points.</p>",
