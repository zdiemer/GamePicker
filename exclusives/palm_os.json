        "description": "<p><em>You are a bold swordsman, penetrating deep within the monster-infested depths of the sinister wizard Zagor's catacomb fortress inside Firetop Mountain. With your wits, your blade, and more than a bit of luck, you will come out on top against fantastic enemies and strange magic, overcoming the warlock's hold on the countryside and making off with his legendary treasure hoard!</em></p>\n<p>Some 20-odd years along, after <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=The+Warlock+of+Firetop+Mountain\">an arcade action game</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/27821/seas-of-blood/\">text</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/28579/rebel-planet/\">adventure</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/27528/temple-of-terror/\">games</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Deathtrap+Dungeon\">a fully 3D dungeon romp</a>, things come full circle and they conclude that the most commercially viable use for the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/6087/fighting-fantasy-gamebook-adaptations/\">Fighting Fantasy gamebook</a> license is in fact in a staid, by-the-book adaptation of the gamebook's Choose-Your-Adventure gameplay, just like the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/23022/the-citadel-of-chaos/\">second</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=the+Forest+of+Doom\">third</a> back in 1984 (... but now with fewer colours 8)</p>\n<p>For your portable-gaming convenience, this means that this pilot project (sadly, it seems, inadequately commercially successful to inspire subsequent adaptations) incorporates huge swathes of text from the original 1982 Fighting Fantasy gamebook #1's famous 400 paragraphs, as well as many of the original black-and-white illustrations once gracing its pages. What it amounts to are descriptions of rooms and their contents, concluded with a multiple-choice list of options -- some of which yield surprisingly positive outcomes, some which dish up pain and suffering, and some of which are just time-wasting dead ends.</p>\n<p>The gamebooks' elements of randomness are handled through automatic die-rolls here, the computer acting as a virtual accountant keeping tabs on the ebbs and flows of your trademark SKILL, STAMINA and LUCK scores and managing them both in and out of combat situations. Inventory is similarly tracked automatically, as well as the book-holder's option to \"cheat\" -- blocking options whose necessary conditions have not yet been met and doling out a measured three flip-backs, \"undo\" moves permitting retraction to a previous paragraph. (There is no option to simulate a reader's flipping through the book with a handful of fingers crammed in various locations to mark the spots of important crossroads 8)</p>",

The player has access to a primary fire as well as shields and nukes. Once activated the shields make the player invulnerable for a short time. Nukes when launched will destroy everything on the screen, both enemies and their projectiles. The ship can be moved left and right and is also equipped with thrust that sends it forward in short bursts.</p>\n<p>By shooting a complete wave of enemies, they will drop items that the player can collect. These include coins that traded for bonus points at the end of a level, powerup crystals that upgrade the ship's weapons, shields and nukes. Each level ends with a boss fight. Bosses behave in different ways with different ways of attacking and they also have their own weaknesses.</p>",

Unlike traditional match three puzzlers like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/24362/bejeweled/\">Bejeweled</a>, the player here doesn't make matches by swapping adjacent tiles. Instead the player here has to tap on individual tiles which are then removed and matches are made from the tile that fall down and takes its place. For a match to be made a row or column of at least three tiles has to be made and if not the tapped on tile will reappear at its original location. The game has two game modes: relaxed and timed. In relaxed mode the player can play until there are no more possible matches to be made while in timed mode matches has to be made before time runs out. Each match then leads to extra time being added.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Interlopers</em> is a <em>Space Invaders</em> variant that expands on the original game by adding some new features. The basics are the same: the player moves his ship left and right behind three sets of barriers while blasting away at the aliens that descend from above. A major difference however is that it is possible to acquire new weapons and special equipment between waves. This is done with money that is occasionally dropped from the aliens. In addition to money the aliens might also drop two power-ups: one that recharges the player's shield and one that provides energy to the special equipment. Due to the shield the player here does not get killed instantly when hit but can take some damage. When starting out the special equipment is a random teleporter, but others such as repair units and guided missiles can be acquired.</p>",

It is set in a traditional fantasy world populated by elves, dwarves, humans and all sorts of of vile creatures. The king is mad, his heir disappeared in the woods, the doom is impending and you need to sort that all out. The game leans towards action, and the graphics uses isometrical perspective.</p>\n<p>The game starts with creation of a character, where you may choose between three races and four classes: warrior, mage, thief or a priest. Casting classes has their set of spells and the other two can choose proficiency with different weapons and typical rogue skills like \"hide in shadows\" or \"pick locks\". Advancing your character is also traditional and based on experience gathering and then updating your skills. Besides that it is possible to hire a henchman to help you out or get a pet.</p>\n<p><em>Edge</em> is played in real-time, but the movement is restricted to tiles like it was in a more recent <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Eschalon+Book+\">Eschalon</a></em> series. The gameplay revolves around solving many quests, interacting with NPCs, exploring and fighting. The combat can be executed in two ways: automatically or action-style - mashing the right buttons, if the device gets enough of them.</p>",

The game features the same isometric presentation, point&amp;click control and simplified roleplaying system that employs four basic stats. Character can use a variety of weapons, armor and learn magical spells. The ultimate goal is to collect four parts of the Gammalion ring and defeat the ancient prophet.</p>\n<p>The back story goes like this: the land of Basylonia has suffered greatly since the king married a foreign women, who turned out to be the devil in the flesh. She gave birth to a boy who looked like a mummy and had no blood. The heir was named Moloch. After an advice from the Devil-appointed figure at the court, the king started to kill his own people and feed his son with their blood. The country succumbed to the darkness with human sacrifices and twisted cults. However, this hasn't gone unnoticed as one day a guy came down from heaven and transformed Basylonia into a barren land. A lot of time has passed since those events, but now people are afraid that the second coming of Moloch is going to happen.</p>\n<p>The game is played in hack&amp;slash style by tapping the screen to go somewhere or to interact with environment. Quests can be received from NPCs that mainly require to kill a certain number of monsters or to find an item. The game world itself is generated for every new game from the main menu. Another interesting feature is the ability to trade items between two players via infrared port of the device.</p>",

The game's graphics are limited to a simple top down 2D view with none of the 3D views of the PC game being available. The game options are the same: ground rules, blindfold chess, tournaments and championship play. The mentor functions are also included: quick and detailed advices, analysis and teaching as well as three tutorial sessions: Chess Rules, Chess Tutor and Chess Rater. Matches can be played against the computer or another human or have two AIs play each other. There are sixteen different AI personalities to choose from. There are also more than 150 classic matches based on real life chess games.</p>",

The game can be played against an AI opponent (three skill levels) or against another human either on the same device or via infrared beam. Like in the classic game, players take shot on each other's ships which are placed on a ten by ten grid. The player that first sinks the opponent's fleet wins. </p>\n<p>The game can be customized in some ways. This includes six different fleet configurations to choose from. The standard configuration consists of a carrier, a cruiser, a destroyer, a sub and a PT boat but other options include Heavy which consists of two carriers but none of the others or Stealthy which consists of four PT boats. Other options include the number of shots per turn (1-9) and whether to have shots marked on the grid or not.</p>",

The game takes place inside the Saturn belt in the year 4017 and the player's mothership has just been attacked by Saturnian Death Squads. Before it explodes the player manages to escape in a small space craft and the objective of the game is simply to survive as long as possible (and get the highest score) before reaching the Saturn's surface. In the way there are numerous asteroids and enemies that give points when shot down. The controls are limited to moving in four directions and firing with a single button. It is possible to collect weapon bonuses but they have limited ammo.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Weecky Dance</em> is a rhythm action game with gameplay similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dance+Dance+Revolution\">Dance Dance Revolution</a>. The aim of the game is simply to dance as long as possible which is done by tapping four buttons. The screen shows a dancer to the left and a big receiver that moves downwards to the right. Arrows appear from the bottom and the player has to press the corresponding button when they reach the receiver. If successful the receiver goes up otherwise it goes down. When performing a certain number of hits the dancer will make some special moves. The game ends when the receiver reaches the bottom of the screen.</p>",

The USSR are preparing a new lethal weapon in a hidden base in Siberia. As a German Luftwaffe pilot, the player's task is to break through the Soviet defences and destroy the weapon. There are three different fighters to choose from with different ratings in speed, power and shield. The game consists of five regular levels and two special slalom levels. Each of the five levels ends with a boss fight.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7949/1942/\">1942</a> and other scrolling shoot 'em ups. The player has access to a regular fire and a bomb which clears all enemies on the screen. Holding down the fire button charges a powerful beam. After destroying enemies it is possible to collect power ups that increases fire power as well as medals that give bonus points.</p>",

It features two modes: Arcade (the standard endless mode) and Flash (a sort of puzzle mode where you have to clear the initial junk).
