        "description": "<p><em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> for the Didj is an educational game that combines the traditional side scrolling platform jumping of the series with spelling practice. The game is similar to the original Sonic games for Genesis and contains seven levels that are based upon the zones of the first three games in the series. The educational elements come from various word based mini games that are accessed by moving through large rings that are scattered around the levels. Sonic is then transported to another room where a spelling task needs to be completed. There are three different ones: One involves spinning a wheel to choose letters, while in another Sonic has to jump on the right letters and in the third Sonic has to be launched from a cannon. After correctly spelling a word the player is awarded with a large amount of rings.</p>",
