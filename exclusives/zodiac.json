        "description": "<p>Spy Hunter: Missile Crisis was inspired by the Spy Hunter released in 2001. Like that, it is a full 3D game, but not a port of it. The game is an independently built addition to the Spy Hunter series, having its own story. Player is set to fight against the evil Nostra organization on various countries and locations like Germany, Venice, Alexandria and Grand Canyon.</p>\n<p>To accomplish the missions, you are given an advanced agent vehicle which transforms between a car, motorcycle and a boat. It can also hold a varying set of weapons and tools to slow down enemy vehicles. In addition to the story driven mode, a more classic arcade mode is available. Also support for local multiplayer gaming over bluetooth is present.</p>",
