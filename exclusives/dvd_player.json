        "description": "<p><em>Harry Potter Interactive DVD Game: Hogwarts Challenge</em> is based on the first three <em>Harry Potter</em> films and allows the player to become a wizard-in-training at Hogwarts. It's built around fourteen different mini games as well as short video clips from the movies. As a student the player has to take classes and each class is represented by a certain mini game that is played with the remote controller. The game is divided into three years and for each year the player has to complete three classes to reach the year-end challenge and then advance to the next year. Ultimately after all three years it's possible to win tickets for the Quidditch World Cup. In addition to classes there are also additional mini-games called extracurricular activities that are unlocked as classes are completed.</p>\n<p>The game can be played both alone or against up to three other human players. Each player then chooses one of the four houses at Hogwarts and compete against each other in trying to get the highest score. It is possible to customize the difficulty for each player and there is also a mystery wand option where the difficulty level changes depending on how well the player is doing.</p>",

As such, this port no longer features save function but instead provides the player with a password which lets one continue from a specific point in the game based on player's choices. The story revolves around four childhood friends and their reunion five years after. You are a high-school student going through a story of growing up and falling in love. The game features many choices during gameplay which branch the story in several directions and lead it to one of many different endings. The game features all the adult content, but all the key scenes are censored nonetheless. DVD remote control (or DVD player application on a computer or a console) lets you fast forward or skip through the dialogues until you reach the point of branching the story based on your response. Character art relies on static portraits with different poses with no animation whatsoever, but all the heroines feature full voice-acting. The game comes with unlocked CG gallery which presents heroines in both regular and adult scenes.</p>",

Kouki Inoue, the protagonist and the apprentice manager, is dating Manami Ayasaka (\u5f69\u5742 \u611b\u7f8e), an actress, but due to load of work they barely have time to spend with each other. Despite the lack of time, they feel jealous and overprotective of each other and have continued to feel of each other as irreplaceable partner and are wholeheartedly devoted to one another. But in such an unbalanced relationship the strong love they have for each other may take turn to unexpected as another people appear on the scene, Mitsuru Tsurugi (\u5263 \u5145), a star actor and a womanizer, and Reina Oosaki (\u5927\u5d0e \u73b2\u5948), Manami's manager who is experienced and also acts as your mentor.</p>\n<p>This visual novel plays like any other where bulk of the gameplay is reading the text which self-plays in a DVD version, halting at the key points where the player can input choices that branch the story. Sex scenes, as well as regular character artwork do not feature any animations and only vary in different poses. The game continuation is done using passwords that are given at designated points in the game story, based on your actions up to that point. Upon completing the game, a special password is given which lets you access music player, CG gallery, and adult event scenes.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>UEFA Champions League</em> is an officially licensed DVD game about the annual international football tournament. Like many other DVD games it's similar to a quiz but here correct answers leads to passes and shots being made. Each question is accompanied with a video clip from the history of the competition and there are a few different kinds of questions. Some are traditional trivia questions where the players have to pick the correct answer while others involve figuring out what happens next in the video, for example does the player score or where in the goal does he score? Other types of questions hide the ball and the player has to guess where it is while others show a scrambled video and the player has to figure out who it depicts.</p>\n<p>There are two game modes: a penalty shoot-out for one player or a team match for two players. The penalty mode works like a real penalty shoot-out with each team shooting five penalties. The player is the red team and for each round first have to answer a question to score and then after that answer another one to make a save. </p>\n<p>The two player mode works more like a real match with the two teams attempting to win possession and score goals. After each player has chosen a formation there is a coin toss deciding who begins. The starting team begins in midfield and if they answer their question correctly the ball is passed on to their strikers and another question is given. If they answer this one correctly they will shoot and if they are right the opposition has to answer a question correctly to save it. If a team at any time misses a question the opposition team will win possession of the ball and have a chance to counter. At half time the player can change their formations and the game will then progress as before. If a match ends in a draw a penalty shoot-out will decide the winner.</p>",

The game does not only feature the same story line as that game, it is entirely built around video footage of it. Therefore the player sees Lara from a third-person perspective like in other games in the series as she runs, jumps and climbs around the levels, but for most of the time there is no control over her movement. At certain times the video stops and the player gets to choose what Lara should do next.</p>\n<p>The game is mainly controlled with the remote control's arrow buttons which are context sensitive depending on what Lara has around her. What each button does in a situation appears on the screen. It can for example say \"jump\", \"climb stairs\" and \"open door\". Some commands lead to progress through the game, while others lead to a Game Over screen. Some might be harder, but will make the player earn points, for example when choosing to explore when short on time. When enemies appear it is often possible to choose between shooting or doing a stealth attack. Some puzzle-solving exists as objects are picked up and then have to be used at the right location. In some situations a \"play safe\" option can be chosen. It is essentially a skip feature where Lara will automatically solve the problem.</p>\n<p>Certain commands lead to action sequences. Most commonly these are quick time events and there are two types. One where a single button has to be pressed repeatedly and one where a correct sequence of buttons needs to pressed. Often these have a lime limit and if not completed in time it might lead to a Game Over. Sometimes the player is told to memorize the sequence of buttons and then has to enter them without seeing them. There are also some shooting sequences where the arrow buttons are used to move a crosshair over the screen. The enemy has to be shot before time runs out.</p>\n<p>The game can be played in hot-seat multiplayer involving two teams taking turns playing the missions. The aim is then simply to earn the most points. Although it says teams, there is nothing in the game that requires more than one person playing.</p>\n<p>The game is divided into three acts and each act comprises about eight levels, at the end of each level the player(s) receive a five digit pass code enabling them to restart from that point next time. When played as a multiplayer/team game both teams score points as they progress through the game but only the player/team that is the first to complete the level increases their score. If team one starts and completes the level they take all the points and team two starts the next level. However if team one starts a level and fails to complete, usually this means making the wrong choice and getting Lara killed, then team two gets the chance to pick up from that point and try to complete the level.</p>",

There is only one mode of play. In rounds 1,2 &amp; 3 the players taking turns to answer questions. The player has a choice of Easy, medium or a hard question and all answers are multiple choice. At the end of the round there is an 'All Play' question where the first player to shout out the correct answer wins, in these questions the players are shown a series of clues and must identify the match, player, manager or event they are referring to.  </p>\n<p>Round four is a 'What Happened Next' round where players are shown a video clip and must say what happened, they then play the remainder of the clip to find out if they were right. </p>\n<p>In rounds one, two and three players score one, two or three points depending on the difficulty of the question - no points are scored or lost for an incorrect answer. However, in the final round players can lose one, two or three points for an incorrect answer.</p>\n<p>Questions are varied and range from 'Which club did ??? go to when he left Newcastle?', 'Who was the youngest player to ...?' through to video clips where the question could be 'Who scored that goal?' to 'What match was that?'. They cover the club's history through to the 2005/2006 season.</p>",

The categories are Families, Workplace, Romance, Woolpack, Feuds and Friendship, if a player answers a question correctly in a category they 'win' that category but should the spinner reselect the same group they must once again answer a question correctly to retain that category. This game can be played in Timer On mode where players have a fifteen second window to answer the questions or Timer Off where there's no limit.</p>\n<p>In the Longer Game players play the game in exactly the same way as the Standard Game but now they must answer correctly each of the six categories twice in order to 'win' that group, an incorrect answer will lose them the group and two further correct questions must be answered to win it back.</p>\n<p>In the Superfan Game players are asked six multiple choice questions, one from each category, to earn a Superfan rating.</p>",

Making Sudoku into a multiplayer game means introducing some means of scoring. The ides here is that the game shows a Sudoku puzzle and highlights a cell, the player holding the DVD remote then shouts out the answer before within the pre-agreed time limit. When the timer expires the game reveals the answer, if they are correct the nominated score keeper writes their score down on the score pad so if the player correctly deduced that the answer was 'four' they would score four points. </p>\n<p>Some cells are designated double or triple cells and the player scores two or three times the value of the number in that cell, there's also an 'All Play' cell where anyone can answer and the first correct answer scores ten extra points. </p>\n<p>When the game is complete the scorekeeper adds up the scores and announces the winner.</p>",

This option must be used with care because Gary may not be correct and each player can use it just once per game.</p>\n<p>In the single player game the contestant must answer twenty questions correctly to win the game. They are allowed one incorrect answer, they get a yellow card, but the second wrong answer means a red card and the end of the game.</p>\n<p>The multiplayer game is played differently and is intended to mimic a game of football. Players/teams take turns to answer questions, the team doing the answering is termed the team 'in possession'. If a team answers three consecutive questions correctly they get a bonus question and if they get that right then they score a goal, however the subject of the bonus question is decided by their opponents. If any question is answered incorrectly then that side loses possession and the other team has a chance to score. The first team to score three goals wins the match.</p>\n<p>All questions are multiple choice with just four options. The game claims over one thousand questions and more than one hundred and thirty video clips from the UK League, FA Cup, Champions League and International matches. Some questions are delivered by the host, Gary Lineker, and for these questions the 'Gamble With Gary' option is disabled.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Now That's What I A Call Music Quiz 2</em> is a music quiz for up to four people, it has three modes of play which are;* Chart Climber: This game is for one to four players, it is the only game mode with a single player option. Here players start in chart position twenty and take turns answering questions worth one, two or three cart positions with the objective of being the first to reach number one. Question topics include Lyrics, Rock, Cover Versions, Bad Haircuts, Fashion Disasters etc and the three point question is always a mystery. Some questions have an associated penalty, for example if the player gets it wrong they may be frozen for one or two rounds, instead of going up x places they go down 'x' or sometimes '2x' places, they could go one position below the lowest player and so on. Other questions allow the player to swap places with another player, go one position higher than the highest player and so on\n* Platinum Collection: This game mode is for two, three or four players, in it there are nine groups of themed questions based around particular decades, Solo artists, Lyrics etc. Players take turns selecting a category and try to answer three consecutive questions correctly, if they do then they win that category and it becomes unavailable to the other player(s). The first to collect five collections wins the game</p>\n<p>The questions used in 'Chart Climber' are re-used in 'Platinum Collection'. In both these game modes the player may see a picture, a video, or hear an audio clip. The questions are all multiple choice with three possible answers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Free For All: This game mode is for two, three or four players and can be played over three, five or ten rounds. The game shows a picture of the game's title screen, small pieces are removed to reveal an artist's picture. The idea is that one player will shout out the identity of the artist, at this point someone presses a button on the remote and the picture and identity are revealed. The game then prompts 'Who answered?', 'Was it answered correctly?' whereupon it adds or deducts points accordingly. Players score more points by answering quickly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is no manual supplied with this game but there are detailed on-screen instructions. None of the questions narrated, the audio is restricted to the song and video clips and an end of game \"Now That's What I Call a Winner. Well Done Player 'X'!\"</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Deal Or No Deal: Family Challenge</em> is a single player game based on the UK game show hosted by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Noel+Edmonds\">Noel Edmonds</a>. </p>\n<p>The format of the game mirrors the format of the show with the player trying to beat 'the Banker' as they open twenty two sealed boxes which contain randomly assigned sums of money inside ranging from 1p to \u00a3250,000. The game sees the player selecting one numbered box at the start of the game and eliminating remaining the boxes one by one. At various points 'the Banker' will offer a cash-out deal, the first offer comes after five boxes have been eliminated and thereafter offers come after every three eliminations. At the end of the game when the player is left with two boxes they may be offered the chance to swap their initial box for the one other remaining box.</p>\n<p>There are three game modes;* Single Player Mode: This plays just like the show, which is described above</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Family Game: This too plays just like the show but it is a multiplayer game for two to five players. At every point where the banker makes an offer each player has the option of continue playing or accepting the banker's deal, the winner is the player who banked/won the most</li>\n<li>Player vs Banker: This is a two player game, one player takes the role of the banker while the other plays the game eliminating boxes in the usual way. The player taking the role of banker is only active when a deal is to be made, the game offers a choice of three possible deals to select from and the player accepts or rejects the deal as normal. The banker wins if they can persuade the player to deal for an amount that is less than the value in their box, the player wins if they cash out for a higher value than the one contained in their box</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The DVD also has a Dream Factory option which takes the player behind the scenes, a Preferences option which cuts out a lot of the comments from the people who open the boxes, and a How To Play option in which <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Noel+Edmonds\">Noel Edmonds</a> explains the game's rules</p>\n<p>The game was filmed in front of a live audience and real people open the boxes on the player's behalf</p>",

If the player gets a question wrong they can continue, additionally some questions have more than one correct answer and here only the 'most interesting' answer wins. After half of the questions there is a 'road block' the host appears and, more often than not, tells the player that they made a mistake somewhere along the line and sends them back to the beginning.</p>\n<p>There are seven groups of questions in all, 1 - Suicide; 2 - Wyoming; 3 - Zapador; 4 - Draculin; 5 - Steely Dan, 6 - Pot Pourri; 7 - Lisieux, and they can be attempted in any order. Unlike other quizzes these groups are not question categories their titles are more like a starting points on a journey through random facts as the answer to one question will be connected to the next question either directly or indirectly through the coherent ramblings of the host<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/112741/stephen-fry/\">Stephen Fry</a>.  </p>\n<p>If the player manages to answer the fifty questions in a group correctly they are rewarded with a letter. Once they have completed all seven groups they will have the seven letters of an anagram. Once solved that anagram can be used as a password on the game's website where the first one hundred winners received a certificate proclaiming \"I am Quite Interesting\".</p>",

It's based on the familiar formula and is hosted by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Chris+Tarrant\">Chris Tarrant</a>. This is the 10th Anniversary Special Edition in the franchise and comes in a fat DVD case very shiny, metallic case inlay that contains both the DVD and a four player buzzer system which the game format has been slightly modified to make use of. The familiar player aids, 50:50, Phone A Friend, and Ask The Audience are still present. </p>\n<p>The instructions explain how the buzzer system is configured to send the DVD player the same Up/Down/Left/Right signals that the player's DVD remote sends. Once this has been set up the back of the buzzer control is pointed at the DVD player, the players take a controller each and the game is ready to play.</p>\n<p>There are two game options; the 'Multi-Millionaire Challenge' and the 'Special Anniversary Games', each can be played as an Adult, Junior or Mixed game. There is no single player mode in this game, in both game modes competing players aim to win the most money possible. The 'Special Anniversary Games' features eleven games from ten years of the UK television show complete with video clips of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Chris+Tarrant\">Chris Tarrant</a> and the contestant, the players are then presented with the same questions that the live contestant was asked to see if they can do any better.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Telly Addicts</em> is a DVD game for one or two people/teams. It is based on a UK television series that ran from 1985 to 1998 on BBC1. The programme was hosted by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Noel+Edmonds\">Noel Edmonds</a> who also presents this game. </p>\n<p>This game has six rounds;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Round One \"Screen Test\": In this round the player(s) are shown six TV screens each of which leads to a question. Typically the player(s) are shown a picture and an associated question with three multiple choice questions. In a single player game three questions are selected by the player, in the two player game the players take turns answering three questions each. Questions in this round are worth one point each.</li>\n<li>Round Two \"Guess The Year\": Here each player in turn is shown a picture or video and is asked a date related question such as \"What year was this programme first shown?\", this question is worth two points. They are then asked two follow up questions which are worth one point each.</li>\n<li>Round Three \"On The Box\": Here the player(s) are asked to identify either a TV personality or the character they are playing. As with the previous round the players are asked one set of questions each, the first question is worth two points and the two follow up questions are worth one point each.</li>\n<li>Round Four \"Odd One Out\": In this round the players have one question each. They are shown a picture with, typically, four people in it and they are asked to spot the odd one out. If they answer correctly they receive three points, but if the player does not know they can take up to two clues with the point value of the question decreasing for each clue taken.</li>\n<li>Round Five \"Classic Clips\": Again the players are asked one set of three questions each. Each set starts with a video clip and the first question is usually observational such as \"Where did the actress wear her sash, right, left, centre?\"</li>\n<li>Round Six \"Spotlight\": Each player is asked three random questions and has fifteen seconds to answer each</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the end of round two and all rounds that follow it Noel shows the players' scores. When the whole game has been played Noel introduces a competition in which players text their answer for a chance to win a home cinema system.</p>",

The rounds are;\n- Round One \"Player Power\": In this round the team(s) are shown a picture or video of a footballer which they have to identify. The second and third questions are related to that footballer and are typically questions like;\n    * 'From which club was he signed?',\n    * 'What number did he wear?',\n    * 'In the 2006 World Cup how many goals did he score?' and so-on.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Round Two \"Golden Goals\": Here each player in turn is shown a video and is asked two questions about players taking part. Typical questions are;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>'Who scored that goal?',</li>\n<li>'Who passed the ball to the scorer?',</li>\n<li>'Who was the goalkeeper?',</li>\n<li>'In this classic match what was the final score?'</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Round Three \"Make The Link\": Here the team(s) are asked three football questions, the first is a random question but the second has some connection to the first and the third has some connection to the second. In the next two questions after identifying the footballer the player is shown a new picture before the question is asked. Some of the questions that could be faced are;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>'Name the 1st player's brother?',</li>\n<li>'In their managerial career when was the first time they qualified for a championship?'</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Round Four \"The Gaffer\": Three questions in this round. In the first the team(s) have to identify a club manager. In the second question they have to pick two clubs he/she has managed from a list of four possible pairs. The final question is about an event in their career. Typically 'When did they first win the League Cup?', 'How many trophies did they win with one of their clubs?' etc</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Round Five \"Mind Games\": Here the team(s) must identify one footballer from the four pictured based on the clue they are given. If they can do so they score three points however if they cannot name the player they can ask for a clue. There are two clues and each reduces the value of the answered question by one point. A typical first clue would be something like; 'He started his career at this club in 1999' or 'He made his international debut against this country in 2004'.<br>\nFollow up clues could be 'He was signed by this club in 2006', or 'His transfer set a new record of \u00a3xxx.xxx.xxx'</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Round Six \"Extra Time\": Each player is asked five random questions and has ten seconds to answer each. The questions are not related</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the end of round two and all rounds that follow it Terry shows the team(s) scores. When the whole game has been played Terry introduces a competition in which contestants text their answer for a chance to win a footballing prizes.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?: 3rd Edition</em> is a DVD game for up to four players. \n It's based on the familiar formula of the TV show and is hosted by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Chris+Tarrant\">Chris Tarrant</a>. It is similar to the game \n<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Who+Wants+To+Be+A+Millionaire:+Family+Entertainment+Edition\">Who Wants To Be A Millionaire: Family Entertainment Edition</a>. Both games claim 1500 new questions including, for the first time, 400 new picture-based questions and a new feature adult of junior questions.</p>\n<p>However, unlike <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Who+Wants+To+Be+A+Millionaire:+Family+Entertainment+Edition\">Who Wants To Be A Millionaire: Family Entertainment Edition</a>, this game sticks closer to the traditional TV format - for example there are no question categories to choose from.<br>\nThe game starts by asking how many players there are, it then asks which players are adult and which are junior. From then on the players are asked questions alternately and the basic rules of the game are unchanged. Fifteen questions stand between each player and a virtual one million pounds, there is no time limit to any of the questions. Each question is multiple choice with four possible answers. Each correct answer takes the player closer towards the jackpot and there are two \"guarantee points\", one at \u00a31,000 and one at \u00a332,000, which means an incorrect answer after these milestones have been passed doesn't cost the player everything.\nThe picture questions don't appear until after the \u00a31,000 guarantee point has been passed.</p>\n<p>The player has the three usual lifelines, 'Ask The Audience', '50-50', and 'Phone A Friend'. With the last option the player is shown a picture of three people together with a brief description such as; 'Susan, Age: 62, Interests: Housework, On-line Gambling, Anime'. They select their 'friend' and then hear a faux 'phone call which may or may not help.\nAs with some of the other games in this series a live audience has been used, they show in the introduction when <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Chris+Tarrant\">Chris Tarrant</a>, some background shots and when the player uses their 'Ask The Audience' lifeline.</p>\n<p>When the game is over <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Chris+Tarrant\">Chris Tarrant</a> doesn't pop up saying 'Congratulations Player X!', instead the game show the players' scores and provides a link back to the start of the game which displays 'Game Over' on the way.</p>\n<p>If the player completed all fifteen questions correctly they received on-screen instructions for a phone-text competition where the prize was a trip to Paris.</p>",

This version of the game features questions based on films in the Turner Classic Movies library which includes movies such as Casablanca, 2001 - A Space Odyssey, Doctor Zhivago, The Wizard of Oz and more. The game can be played on a board or in 'Party Play' mode, the game board is not used in 'Party Mode' where the players are shown a series of questions and compete to be the first to shout out the answer. </p>\n<p>The game has a 'Pre-set Gameplay' mode, this is because the DVD element of the game randomly selects the questions it asks the players and this may result in some questions being repeated, using this mode removes that possibility.</p>\n<p><em>Scene It?: Turner Classic Movies Edition</em> was sold in two forms, as a boxed game which includes the game board and as an expansion pack for those who already had a game board by virtue of owning one of the other games in the series. The board is called a 'flex-time game board' after it's novel feature, when there's not enough time/interest to play a full game it can be folded thus reducing it's size so that a shorter game can be played. </p>\n<p>There are two ways to win the game. The downloadable rules say that the game is completed when a player collects ten trivia cards while the DVD game instructions show that the player must travel round the board to the 'Final Cut' area where they must answer three challenge questions to win.</p>\n<p>The game is played with two dice, a six sided die that determines how far the player moves and an eight sided die which determines the challenge the player will face. After the player has rolled both dice and moved their token they may have to complete a challenge, if successful they collect a trivia card and take another turn.\nSooner or later the player will land on one of the following squares* The 'My Play' square: this is a DVD challenge in which a scene is viewed and a relevant question is asked. If the player answers successfully they take a trivia card and have another turn.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 'All Play' square: This is also a DVD challenge, it is the same as the 'My Play' square but any player can answer. If the current player answers correctly they take another turn, if any other player answers correctly the current player's turn ends and the next player takes their turn.</li>\n<li>The 'Trivia Card Challenge' square: One of the opposing players draws a trivia card and reads the question and the player must answer within the allotted time, the DVD has a timer function which is set at the start of the game. There three different types of challenge, Take Three; Songs and Catchphrases; Pictures and People</li>\n<li>Players Choice/Buzz Card: Buzz cards are only present if the player has a full <em>Scene It</em> game, when playing with just the game pack this square allow the player top choose the kind of trivia challenge they face.</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p><em>James May's Motormania Car Quiz</em> is a single player DVD quiz about automobiles.</p>\n<p>The game starts with the player selecting the kind of car they wish to play for from the following five categories; Super Cars, Sports Cars, Classic Cars, American Muscle Cars, and Racing Cars. The player chooses their preferred category of car and are awarded what <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=James+May\">James May</a> considers to be the best car of that type then the quiz begins. There are thirty questions in each game and for every three incorrect answers supplied the player's car is taken away and replaced with a less desirable model, getting all questions wrong will result in the player finishing the game with a bicycle. \nFor example the best Classic Car' is the Bugatti Type 57SC Atalante but getting three questions wrong sees it being replaced by the Ferrari 250 GTO with accompanying comments from the host <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=James+May\">James May</a>, and so on. The object of the game is to finish the quiz with the most desirable car and not the bicycle.</p>\n<p>The types of questions asked range from cars used in films/adverts, identify this headlight, people associated with Formula One and, while American cars feature prominently, they have a UK bias.</p>\n<p>All questions are read by cheery <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=James+May\">James May</a> who occupies a small on-screen window. When he has finished speaking the text version of the question appears. The questions are not related to the class of car the player selected at the start of the game. All questions are multiple choice and the player selects A, B, or C using the controls of their DVD remote, the correct answers are not revealed.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Scene It?: Glee</em> is one of a series of games in the <em>Scene It?</em> series. This version of the game features questions based on Glee\u00a0an American\u00a0television series that was broadcast between May 2009 and March 2015.\u00a0 </p>\n<p>The game can be played on a board or in 'party play' mode and also has bonus activities.</p>\n<p>This is a boxed game which is played on the standard Scene It? 'flex-time' game board so-called because of its novel feature, when there's not enough time/interest to play a full game it can be folded, thus reducing it's size so that a short game can be played. The player(s) must travel round the board to the 'Final Cut' area where they must answer three DVD challenge questions to win. There is also a 'Preset Game Mode' that minimises the chance of a question being repeated.</p>\n<p>The game is played with two dice, a six sided die that determines how far the player moves and an eight sided die which determines the challenge the player will face. After the player has rolled both dice and moved their token they may have to complete a challenge, if successful they take another turn and continue to do so until they make an error. The challenge squares the player will face in their travels are determined by the eight sided die, they are;* 'My Play': this is a DVD challenge in which a scene is viewed and two relevant questions are asked. The first question is for the current player only, the second question is an All Play question which is described below. If the current player gets either question right they take another turn.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>'All Play': This is also a DVD challenge, it is the same as the 'My Play' square but any player can answer. If the current player answers correctly they take another turn, if any other player answers correctly they move two spaces around the board, the current player's turn ends and the next player takes their turn.</li>\n<li>'My Puzzle': the DVD controller is used to select a question which the player must answer within the allotted time, (the DVD has a timer function which is set at the start of the game).</li>\n<li>\n<p>'Trivia Challenge': Here another player draws a trivia Challenge card and reads the question. There are three categories of trivia question 'Beyond Glee', 'Music', and 'Gleek' and there is one question from each category on one side with the answers on the reverse. If the player answers a question from the hardest category, Gleek, correctly then they move an additional two spaces.\n.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>'Players Choice': here the player selects a trivia card or DVD category of their choice.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bonus Content: There are three bonus content games, none of them use the game board, all of them use the DVD;* Sing It: here a short clip is played and the player must sing the next few lines after the music stops</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Act It: This is based on the parlour game Charades and requires the player to act out a song title for the rest of the group. The rules say the player can use conventional hand signals or \"act out the choreography from memory.\"!! Here the group must look away from the television while the nominated player reads the song title they must mime.</li>\n<li>Say It: Here the player must give clues allowing the other players to identify a Glee character without mentioning the actor/actress, a character or any songs they appeared in. Again the group must look away from the television while the nominated player reads the character they must represent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Party Play: Described as 'perfect for a Glee party' this mode presents a series of questions for a large group to play, shouting out the answers as the board is not used in this mode</p>",

'flex-time' game board so-called because of its novel feature, when there's not enough time/interest to play a full game it can be folded, thus reducing it's size so that a short game can be played. The player(s) must travel round the board to the 'Final Cut' area where they must answer an 'All Play To Win' challenge. If they are successful they win the game, if not they move to the outer Final Cut circle and must successfully answer three DVD challenge questions to win. </p>\n<p>The box contains a folding game board, four metal tokens; James Bond, a vodka martini glass, a Bond car and a Bond Girl.</p>\n<p>The game is played with two dice, a six sided die that determines how far the player moves and an eight sided die which determines the challenge the player will face. After the player has rolled both dice and moved their token they may have to complete a challenge, if successful they take another turn and continue to do so until they make an error or the category die shows a Q - see below. Players move before they attempt a challenge and if they are on an 007 space they move twice the number rolled, The challenges the player will face in their travels are determined by the eight sided die, they are;* 'My Play': this is a DVD challenge in which a scene is viewed a question is asked.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>'All Play': this is a DVD challenge in which a scene is any player can answer.

        "description": "<p><em>Scene It?: The DVD Movie Game</em> is first game in the <em>Scene It?</em> series and can be played by two to four players or teams.</p>\n<p>The box contains a folding game board, Reference cards, Trivia cards and Buzz cards together with four metal tokens; a film reel, a box of popcorn, a clapper board, and a movie camera, the DVD is held in a card slip case.</p>\n<p>The game is played on the Scene It? 'flex-time' game board so-called because of its novel feature, when there's not enough time/interest to play a full game it can be folded, thus reducing it's size so that a short game can be played.   </p>\n<p><em>Scene It?: The DVD Movie Game</em> is played with two dice, a six sided die that determines how far the player moves and an eight sided die which determines the challenge the player will face. After the player has rolled both dice and moved their token they may have to complete a challenge, if successful they take another turn and continue to do so until they make an error or the category die shows 'buzz' - see below. Players move before they attempt a challenge and if they are on an 'Double Feature' space they move twice the number rolled. The challenges the player will face in their travels are determined by the roll of the eight sided die, they are;* 'My Play': this is a DVD challenge in which a scene is viewed a question is asked.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>'All Play': this is a DVD challenge in which a scene is any player can answer.</li>\n<li>'Buzz Card': If the category die shows 'buzz' the player selects a Buzz Card from the pack, follows the instructions and their turn ends.</li>\n<li>'Trivia Challenge': Here another player draws a trivia Challenge card and reads the question. There are three categories of trivia question 'Take Three' in which the player must identify a performer or movie based on three clue', 'Songs and Slogans', and 'Pop Culture' each represented by a distinct symbol on the category die. On one side of the Trivia Card there is a question from each category with the answers on the reverse.</li>\n<li>'Players Choice': here the player selects a trivia card or DVD category of their choice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The player(s) must travel round the board to the 'Final Cut' area where they must answer an 'All Play To Win' challenge. It is possible for two players to answer an 'All Play To Win' question simultaneously, in this case the DVD Tiebreaker question/challenge is used. \n If the player in the Final Cut area answers the 'All Play To Win' successfully they win the game, if not they move to the outer Final Cut circle and must successfully answer three DVD challenge questions to win. </p>\n<p>Unlike later games in the series this game has no 'Party Play' option on the main menu however the instructions say that a Scene It party is still possible by selecting My Play and All Play questions at random.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Pub Quiz: Hosted By Vince Earl</em> is a DVD quiz game containing twelve games each with twelve trivia rounds, five questions per round. It was developed and marketed to raise money for <em>The Golden Golf Charitable Trust</em>, a charitable organisation that helps disadvantaged children. The game is intended for two or more players but there is a single player mode and this is limited to the first six games. In keeping with a live pub quiz the host, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/840785/vince-earl/\">Vince Earl</a> cracks jokes and delivers the questions in such a way as to help create a convivial, pub-like atmosphere.</p>\n<p>There is a score sheet on the DVD in .pdf format which can be printed out as answering and scoring is done manually, there are printable 'Joker cards' (see below). The game starts with the player(s) selecting how many players are taking part, then the player(s) name their teams.</p>\n<p>Each round has five questions, these are a video question, an audio question, an image question, a multiple choice question and a 'Q &amp; A'. Each correct question scores one point unless the team has played their 'Joker card' on that question in which case they could score two points. After six rounds the game pauses, answers are revealed, mid point scores are totalled, drinks are replenished etc and then it resumes with the final six rounds. Each round is based on a specific topic, the topics for all twelve rounds are;* Round 1: General Knowledge</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Round 2: Sport</li>\n<li>Round 3: Television</li>\n<li>Round 4: Geography</li>\n<li>Round 5: Celebrity</li>\n<li>Round 6: Music</li>\n<li>Round 7: History</li>\n<li>Round 8: Maths</li>\n<li>Round 9: Languages</li>\n<li>Round 10: Science Nature</li>\n<li>Round 11: Film</li>\n<li>Round 12: Art &amp; Literature</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the end of the quiz the team with the highest score wins and there are tie break questions should teams finish on the same score, the answers to all tie break questions are numbers.</p>\n<p>Also on the DVD are interviews with Vince Earl and a couple of outtakes, these are all on the 'EXTRAS' menu</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Disney Hannah Montana: DVD Game</em> is a quiz game for one or more people/teams. The game comes in a keep case contained within a card sleeve. Inside the case is a three panel foldout which explains all the games, a couple of adverts and the DVD, Once loaded the DVD plays a series of adverts before the game's menu appears, it consists of a series of mini games grouped by the number of people required to play them, as follows;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Games for one player:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Hannah Montana Trivia Challenge: This is a series of twenty trivia questions, some are plain questions, some have a still photo and others have a short video clip from a Hannah Montana show. Answers are multiple choice and use the up/down/left/right controls on the DVD to make a selection. When a selection has been made a green tick shows if the player is correct, a red cross shows if the player is incorrect. At the end of the questions the player is given their score and offered the choice of playing another quiz or another activity</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pop Star: This is a single player karaoke game. There are seven songs here \"Nobody's Perfect\", \"The Best Of Both Worlds\", \"If We Were A Movie\", \"Rock Star\", \"Who Said\", \"Life's What You Make It\", \"I Got Nerve\". All songs are played against the same background which shows a microphone, spotlights and a shadowy crowd. The songs are just under two minutes long, they all have two lines of lyrics appear at the bottom of the screen in white and change colour as they are sung. There's no scoring here it's just for fun.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dance Off: In this section Lilly teaches the player a dance sequence. There three difficulty settings, <em>Easy</em> has the routines for \"Nobody's Perfect\" and \"Rock Star\"; <em>Intermediate</em> has routines for \"Old Blue Jeans\", \"Best Of Both Worlds\", and \"Who Said\"; <em>Advanced</em> has routines for \"The Other Side Of Me\", Pumpin' Up The Party\", \"Life's What You Make It\". Each dance is broken down into four sections which build into a full sequence. Lilly shows the steps for each section on-screen and follows that with the full sequence up to and including this bit, the player can watch the lesson as many times as they wish before attempting it and they can have as many tries as they wish before advancing to the next section. There is no score in this game.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Band Audition: Hannah &amp; Mr Stuart are auditioning for a drummer. This game is a <em>Simon</em> style mini game where a sequence of drum notes is played, starting with a single note and building into a thirteen note sequence. Each of the four drums corresponds to one of the up/down/left/right arrow keys on the remote. A score of ten or more gets the player into the band</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Seeing Stars memory Game: The player is shown nine pictures of characters from the TV show, the faces are then blanked out and presented to the player one at a time and the task is to put each picture in its correct position. When played as a single player game the player has three lives.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Personality Quiz: There are three quizzes in this game. Quiz One shows the player which cast character they are most like, quiz two shows the kind of rock star they will become and quiz three shows the kind of class character they are. All questions have four possible answers each of which is linked to one of the up/down/left/right arrow keys on the remote. At the end of ten questions the answer is revealed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Games for two players;</p>\n<p>All of the single player games can be played as a two player game. \n+ Hannah Montana Trivia Challenge: As with the single player game the player's play as a character from the TV show, the game then asks a question and players take turns answering it. Every five questions, if one player is in the lead, the game will announce who's ahead and who's falling behind.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Pop Star: This has the same songs as the single player game and plays in just the same way, it's still just for fun and there's no scoring here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dance Off: This game is also just for fun and is the same as the single player game</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Band Audition: The only difference between this and the single player game is that players take it in turns to try and follow the sequence.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Seeing Stars memory Game: This is the same game as the single player game but players try to place the faces into the grid alternately. Each player has just one life and is out of the game when they make their first mistake</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Personality Quiz: Player one chooses a quiz and answers all questions. When the result is announced player two has the option of taking a quiz, in which case they can select any of the three quizzes available, or not taking a quiz and selecting another activity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Keep The Beat: This is a word game. On screen the player(s) select a game speed either slow, medium or fast. The game then provides a subject such as 'Things sold in The Surf Shop' and cuts to a screen showing an audience clapping in time with a performer on-stage to the sound of Queen's \"We Will Rock You\". The players are supposed to clap in time and shout out an answer alternately. Whoever misses their turn loses the game.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>True Friends?: Each player selects a character to play as, player one then answers five questions which are then repeated for player two and a score is then given, the process is then reversed with player two answering five questions first followed by player one. The score shows how many times a question was answered the same by each player. Each question has four possible answers, a sample question is \"Miley makes her dad egg &amp; bacon for breakfast every day. What would your friend make?\", possible answers being pancakes, cereal, toast or eggs</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Games for three players</p>\n<p>The game menu for a three player game is exactly the same as the menu for a two player game. \n+ True Friends?: This game is a game for two people so in a three player game players 1 &amp; 2 play together, then players 2 &amp; 3, finally players 3 &amp; 1 pair up.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep The Beat: As before the game decides which player should start. The first time a player messes up the game is halted and that player is removed and the remaining two players continue as in a two player game.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Games for four or more players;</p>\n<p>This is the same menu as the two and three player game menus but with one new game option 'Party Play'.\n+ True Friends?: This game does not play all possible permutations of pairs that can be had with four players, players 1 &amp; 2; 2 &amp; 3; 3 &amp; 4 and 4 &amp; 1 play together and that's all.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Party Play: There are three activities in this section plus a fourth option of 'Mix It Up!. Games are played by two teams, 'Super Fans and 'Pop Stars'. All three games share the same artwork, and play in a similar manner. The games can be 5, 10, or 15 rounds and players can have either 20, 30, or 45 seconds for their teams to guess the answer, it is expected that only the clue giver of each team to read the task shown on the screen. The countdown timer in all games is a slowly decreasing orange juice, when time runs out the task is displayed and the players are asked whether the answer was guessed or not. The game keeps score of the correct answers for both teams and announces the scores and the winner when all rounds have been played.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Say Whaat?: In this game players have to describe something or someone to the rest of the group without using forbidden words.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hellooo Drama!: This game is played very much the same way as 'Say Whaat?', however in this game the clue giver cannot speak at all and must mime the answer,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Art Class: Again this is basically the same as the two preceding games but the clue giver must draw the answer for their team to guess. Paper and s pen or pencil are required for this game, they are not included in the keep case.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mix It Up! uses examples from each of the other three Party Play games</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The game comes in a keep case contained within a card sleeve. Inside the case is a three panel foldout which explains all the games, a couple of adverts and the DVD.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Carry On Quizzing</em> is a quiz game based on the <em>Carry On</em> series of films, it can be played as either a single player game or as a multi-player game for up to four players. It is presented by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Richard+O'Brien\">Richard O'Brien</a> of <em>Rocky Horror</em> and <em>Crystal Maze</em> fame.</p>\n<p>This is quite a basic quiz with just six hundred questions and no difficulty levels. All the questions multiple choice questions with four answers, responses are made using the up/down/left/right controls of the remote. At intervals, usually at the end of a round or the start of a new one, the player(s) are treated to a classic 'Carry On' film clip.</p>\n<p>A game consists of four rounds of five questions and the game keeps score for both the single and multiplayer games. At the end of each round, assuming some questions have been answered correctly, the player(s) advance down the Carry On Hall Of Fame. When a question is answered incorrectly the player(s) are told this but the correct answer is not revealed,</p>\n<p>The single player game is straightforward quiz. A question is shown, the player responds, they are told whether their answer was right or wrong and the process repeats until the end of the round and, eventually, the end of the game.</p>\n<p>In the multiplayer game the players play as one of four teams, Team 1 is <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Sid+James\">Sid James'</a> \"Helping Hands\"; Team 2 is <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/555507/barbara-windsor/\">Barbara Windsor</a>'s \"Chayste Place Girls\"; Team 3 is <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Charles+Hawtrey\">Charles Hawtrey</a>'s \"Devils In Skirts\"; team 4 is <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Hattie+Jaques\">Hattie Jaques</a>' \"Glam Cabs\". Questions are asked in four rounds each with five questions, as in the single player game. If the question features a picture, sound or video clip this is shown only once before each team in turn is asked the same question. The game lets the player's know if they were right or wrong but nothing on-screen gives any indication which answer they selected so as long as no-one peeks at the DVD remote while the button is pressed every team has an equal chance of guessing the right answer.</p>\n<p>There are five types of questions:* Carry On Guessing: these are straightforward trivia questions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have A Butcher's: These are based on a still photograph</li>\n<li>Carry On Watching: These are based on a video clip</li>\n<li>Quite An Earful: Based on a sound clip</li>\n<li>Ohhh Matron: This kind of question is based on a quote either from a film or something Carry On related said by one of the actors/actresses in an interview</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Questions are all linked to the Carry On films but they are not necessarily directly linked, for example one question was 'Carry On star 'X' played which of these roles in Dr. Who?', another example question is ''While working on which of the following films did 'Y' meet Sid James who brought him into the next Carry On film?'</p>",

At the start of either game the player is shown a selection of six celebrities who form the game panel. Both single player and two player games are identical, in the single player game the player competes against the DVD. A full game takes around fifteen to twenty minutes.</p>\n<p>Round One: Player One starts this round. <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/861994/terry-wogan/\">Terry Wogan</a> reads out an incomplete phrase and player one has to select a word from an on-screen pick list to complete it. Mr Wogan then asks the panellists what word they would have used and the player scores a point for every person who uses the same word that they chose. The process is then repeated with player two.</p>\n<p>Round Two: The player with the lowest score from Round One starts this round. The round is played the same as Round One but the player's can only match their chosen words with the panellists who did not match their word in the previous round. If both players are level after this then there is a tie break round.</p>\n<p>Supermatch Game: Both players take part in this, they are presented with a two word phrase with one word blanked out. The winner of the first round has first pick of one of the three possible answers, the player that picks the top answer wind the round and the player that has the highest score goes through to the final round, the loser gets a Blankety Blank chequebook and pen.</p>\n<p>Final Round: Here the remaining player chooses a panellist to play with, both are presented with another two word phrase with one word blanked out. The player selects an appropriate word from the pick list and if that matches the panellist's word then they win the 'Big Prize', if not they win the coveted Blankety Blank chequebook and pen.</p>\n<p>The panellists used in the game vary from one game to the next. At the start of the game just after the names have been revealed there's an opportunity to read their one or two line biographies.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Pepsi Chart Music Quiz</em> is an interactive DVD quiz with activities for one, for two or one to four players. The DVD also contains a 'Spot The Difference' competition in which the player could win a meeting with one of their favourite pop star's, this closed on Jan 31st 2003. Inside the case is a three panel foldout that is the game's manual, a DVD registration postcard and a competition entry postcard.</p>\n<p>The game starts with a fast paced video sequence leading to the main menu, from here the player can access a competition, profiles of forty pop stars, or play either a missing link game or the main game. * The competition consists spot the difference boards, each board show two versions of the same picture of a pop star or group with three differences on the right hand picture. There are ten boards to work through and at the end the player is given a code word which they put onto the entry form.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Missing Link: Here the player is presented with two rows of three pictures. The top row has pictures of pop band members but the central picture is blank. The bottom row has three pictures of pop stars from which player has to select a picture that completes the band line-up in the top row.</li>\n<li>Pop Profiles: This is not a game, it's information on pop stars and groups of the time. Did you know that Atomic Kitten featured in the 2002 Avon catalogue or that Shakira speaks three languages?</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Game: There are three games to play on the game menu;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Race To The Top: This is a two player/team game. The players start at position forty in the charts and answer questions aiming to be the first to reach 'Number One'. There are seven different question categories Famous Face; Observation; Memory; Photo Fit; Close Up; In The Picture and Guess Who plus a 'Chance' category making eight question types in all.   </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each question has three parts and the player must get all three answers correct to advance up the chart, an Easy question will move the player one position, a Medium question is worth two places while a Hard question is worth three. The first part of the three of the question is always a picture, a typical question set would be something like\n    - Part 1: Identify this star\n    - Part 2: What was their debut album called?\n    - Part 3: Which of these songs was a hit for them?\n+ Top 10 Challenge: This is the single player version of 'Race To The Top'. Again there are three levels of difficulty and all questions are in three parts, the difference here is that the player has to climb just ten places and one mistake ends the game.\n+ Pepsi Chart Music Quiz: This is also the same format as 'Race To The Top' where teams start at the bottom of the Top 40 and race to the top. The variation here is that players/teams have three lives and when they are gone they are out of the game.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

Throughout the game they are referred to by these avatars so the unnamed voice will say \"Christmas Fairy you're up next\", \"Penguin it's your bonus round\", \"Carol Singer you scored eleven points in that round, well done\" and so-on.</p>\n<p>The quiz consists of five themed rounds Television, Food &amp; Drink, Film, Pot Luck, and Music. Each round has seven questions and the players / teams take it in turn answering the questions using the DVD remote to select their answer. The selected answer is NOT shown on the screen as the DVD remote is then passed to the next player/team so that they can also select an answer. At the end of the round the game shows the teams' scores and gives the option of showing the correct answers to each question. After the end of round two and throughout the game from that point the cumulative points are also shown.</p>\n<p>The game has a 'Bonus Christmas Round' which appears once for each player at some random point in the game. In a single player game the question will be a 'Name That Christmas Tune' in five seconds while in a multiplayer game the question could be musical or it could be a charade. While each normal question is worth one point a bonus question scores five points.</p>\n<p>The game has in-game instructions which are voiced by an unnamed actor.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Great British Treasure Hunt</em> is a two part giveaway from the UK newspaper 'The Mail on Sunday' as part of their 25th anniversary celebrations. The first prize was \u00a3150.000 and there were ten runner up prizes of \u00a310.000. This is not the only <em>Great British Treasure Hunt</em> the paper has run, there's one being run in September 2017 which uses clues printed in the paper. </p>\n<p>For two weeks in November 2007 readers were given a free DVD. Each DVD contained ten themed puzzles, entrants had to write the clues on an entry form that appeared in the paper with the second DVD.</p>\n<p>When either DVD is loaded it plays a short video sequence with stirring music together with aerial shots of this green and pleasant land overlaid with famous figures from British history. The introduction ends in a title screen which in turn leads to an optional video in which a presenter explains how the quiz works.</p>\n<p>In the video the presenter explains that the prize money has been locked away in a safe somewhere in the British Isles, all the player needs to locate the treasure are the DVD's and a treasure map printed in the newspaper. The object is to solve the puzzles which ultimately will yield the location of the treasure and a phone number where the player leaves their answer and details. Winners were chosen at random from entries submitted by 16th November 2007.</p>\n<p>On each DVD there are ten 'Great British Icons', each one of which plays a short introduction followed by a puzzle. The answer to each puzzle is a word, when two or more words are put together they reveal a place name, the example given in the DVD's introduction is \"Puzzle one's answer could be 'maid' and puzzle two's answer may be 'stone' which gives the place name 'Maidstone'\". The player then marks the locations on their treasure map and by doing so they reveal the final location.</p>\n<p>Each puzzle MUST be played in the correct order and the puzzle answers MUST be written down in the order they are played. If a player get stuck on any puzzle the helpful presenter is on hand with a hint. A puzzle typically has four or five answers which the player puts into a grid on the back of the treasure map. Some cells in the grid are coloured and the letters from these cells are used to form the single word that is the solution for that puzzle. As a further aid players are advised that, having found an answer they should listen to the short introduction as it will contain the answer, if the player does not hear the word they have found then they have probably made a mistake.</p>\n<p>Once the introduction is over the player is presented with the main menu, here they can repeat the introductory video, start solving puzzles or visit the 'Training Camp' where the puzzle format, use of the DVD remote and even how to complete the solution grid printed in the newspaper are explained.</p>\n<p>DVD One: The Great British Icons on this DVD are all famous people<em> Puzzle one is based on Shakespeare and starts with a short video biography. Four simple riddles then follow the answer to each being a character from one of Shakespeare's plays. The player is then shown a short sentence containing the character's name and they must use the DVD's remote to identify character's name to show they have identified the character correctly. The example given in the puzzle's instructions has the player being asked \"Who was Juliet's Love?\" the answer to which is 'Romeo'. The player is then shown the sentence \"Simon really enjoyed going to </em>Rome o*n the aeroplane.\" within which they must find the name 'Romeo' and click on the first and last letters. Players will be told whether they are right or wrong immediately as they cannot progress to the next question until they have answered correctly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Puzzle two is based on Isambard Kingdom Brunel, after another two minute potted biography the player is presented with four picture puzzles. Here the player must look at two or more pictures and use them to derive a mainline UK train station - a reference to his work as a railway engineer, the example given shows a picture of a <em>chef</em> and a picture of a <em>field</em> from which the player derives the location of Sheffield. To make the puzzle that bit harder not all the pictures are in place - the player must fill in the blanks in order to derive the place names, doing this will leave some pictures unused and it is these that the player must use to derive the location that is entered into the grid on the back of the treasure map.</li>\n<li>Puzzle three is based on Alexander Graham Bell and references his major invention, the telephone. Players are given three telephone numbers which, when decoded, give the name of a famous inventor. The code uses the standard UK telephone dial where 2 = A,B,C; 3 = 3 D,E,F etc. The answers from puzzles one, two and three will yield letters that provide the first location on the treasure map.</li>\n<li>Puzzle four is based on Richard Burton and features a photo montage of people he worked with or married.</li>\n<li>Puzzle five is a word puzzle based on Charles Darwin, the letters from this puzzle and the previous puzzle combine to form the second location on the treasure map. The player completes a pyramid of words working from the bottom up. For each word there is a clue and the letters used in the word come from the word beneath.</li>\n<li>Puzzle six is based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and takes the form of one of Sherlock Holmes' experiments. The player is shown eight jars each of which is labelled by a single letter, clues to what is in each jar are contained in a riddle. The player must solve the riddle, identify the contents of each jar and, to prove that they have done so, must then use the jars to prepare a formula. When correctly done the letters of the jars used in the formula can be arranged to spell a four letter word.</li>\n<li>Puzzle seven features Roger Bannister, the first man to run a mile in under four minutes. This game consists of a running track around which are a series of footprints each containing a letter. The player answers a series of six questions the answer to each is a number. To answer the question the player moves around the track that number of footprints and notes the letter contained in the footprint they land on. When completed correctly the letters will provide a keyword to be entered on the back of the treasure map. Puzzles six and seven provide the third location on the treasure map.</li>\n<li>Puzzle eight is themed around Sir Isaac Newton with a nod towards his formulae. The example given is a cryptic clue \"7 Ds in a W\" and the question is \"What is the third letter of the D word?\". The clue refers to 'Seven days in a week' so the letter the player takes from this puzzle is the 'Y'. There are three such puzzles and the letters are again placed in a grid on the back of the treasure map.</li>\n<li>Puzzle nine uses Sir Winston Churchill as its theme. The puzzle features a decoding machine and a strip of paper tape. The player enters the letters on the paper into the machine noting the decoded response. However three key letters are missing, the player must turn work out what these are as they form the keyword that allows them to continue.</li>\n<li>Puzzle ten has five questions based on the life of Queen Victoria each of which yields a letter, All five letters when put together form a word spelled backwards.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The answers to puzzles eight, nine and ten form the final location for DVD 1. The player is then instructed to join the four locations on the treasure map together with straight lines in the order that they were revealed. The result will be a four sided shape and as an aid the game shows the player four possible shapes, one of which is correct, so that they will know they are on the right track. </p>\n<p>DVD Two: This contains the entire contents of DVD 1 as well as a new set of puzzles, it was published the week after DVD 1 and the newspaper that it came with also had a new copy of the treasure map. The Great British Icons featured on this DVD are all landmarks.* Puzzle one is based on Stonehenge. The player is presented with four separate sequences of letters from which the central letter is missing. As usual the player must complete all four sequences in order to progress. The four letters form a keyword which is entered onto the form on the back of the treasure map</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Puzzle two features the Blackpool Tower. Here there are four questions to be answered each providing a letter of the keyword. The answers from puzzles one and two provide the first location on this DVD</li>\n<li>The third puzzle follows a short introduction to The Giant's Causeway, Northern Ireland's only World heritage site. The puzzle consists of five numeric sequences shown on the rock pillars of the causeway, the player selects a number to complete the sequence and is rewarded with a letter which forms a keyword.</li>\n<li>Cardiff's Millennium Stadium is the setting for the fourth puzzle in DVD Two. It uses the same format as Puzzle two, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, on DVD One but here the pictures form the names of four football teams with the remaining pictures forming the fifth team whose name must be entered onto the grid on the back of the treasure map.</li>\n<li>Ben Nevis, Britain's highest mountain is the setting for the fifth puzzle, it uses the sane format as the Charles Darwin puzzle of DVD One. Her, instead of climbing the mast of H.M.S. Beagle the player assembles a pyramid of words to ascend the mountain. All five words must be entered onto the grid on the back of the treasure map where some cells are coloured. The letters that fall into the coloured cells form a word which, when combined with the solution of the preceding two puzzles gives the next location.</li>\n<li>London's 'Big Ben' is the setting for four puzzles. The example question shown is \"Add 5 hours and 15 minutes to the time Cinderella reputedly turned into a pumpkin.\" <br>\n<em>Note: Cinderella didn't turn into a pumpkin - her coach did - but that's the question they used</em>  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The player has to set the correct time on the dial of Big Ben which in turn rotates a master cog wheel. After each question has been solved the player must note the letter on the top of the master cog.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The seventh puzzle is a simple four clue crossword, as it follows a description of Cornwall's Eden project all the questions and answers are about plants. All four words are entered into a crossword grid on the back of the treasure map where, again some of the cells are coloured. The word from the Big Ben puzzle when combined with this puzzle gives the next location.</li>\n<li>The eighth puzzle on this DVD uses Jodrell Bank as its setting. All the answers to the questions are dates, a month and a day. When entered the date causes a model of the solar system to revolve and a beam from the Earth will highlight a single letter. The three letters form the keyword that is used to form the next destination.</li>\n<li>The penultimate puzzle is linked to 'The White Cliffs Of Dover'. On a drawing of the cliff face are many irregular shapes. Hidden among these shapes is a hexagon. The player must identify the hexagon, make a note of the letters contained in the shapes within its boundary, arrange these letters to form a word and finally enter the keyword into the lighthouse combination lock in order to progress. The words from puzzle eight and this puzzle give the final location to be marked on the treasure map.</li>\n<li>The final landmark is Glastonbury and the four questions are all music related and the answers are all numbers. The player answers by selecting a number from a selection shown on a guitar. When all questions are answered correctly they reveal a shape which should match the shape the player gets when they draw lines connecting the four locations they have derived from the preceding nine puzzles.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With all puzzles solved and all locations plotted on the treasure map the player now has two overlapping shapes. The penultimate task is to use the points of intersection to draw a cross whose centre reveals the final location. All that remained was to call <em>The Mail On Sunday</em> and provide them with the final location and the eight locations derived from the puzzles on the DVD and wait for the good news.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Golden Balls: DVD Game</em> is based on the popular UK game <em>Golden Balls</em> which was originally broadcast between 2007 and 2009. The TV show was hosted by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/659126/jasper-carrott/\">Jasper Carrott</a> who also hosts this game.</p>\n<p>The game comes in a keep case with four two sided 'Golden Wheels' reminiscent of the copy protection code wheels of old PC games. Each side contains thirty eight segments numbered 1-38 on one side and 39-76 on the other. Each segment contains a message such as 'You've been voted off'; '\u00a335,000 \u00a3500 KILLER', and so on. Note: Though the 'Golden Wheels' look the same the messages in the numbered segments differs from one to another.  </p>\n<p>While the TV game was played by four players, this implementation of the game can be played by up to four players with AI players making up the numbers. The 'Golden Wheels' are only used by the human players and then only in rounds one and two.</p>\n<p>Round One: The game has a bank of one hundred golden balls and inside each is a cash amount between 310 and \u00a375,000. The game draws twelve of these balls at random and adds four 'Killer' balls making sixteen in total. These sixteen balls are divided among the four players who display them as two front balls and two back balls. The front balls are revealed while the back balls stay hidden. Players then look at the value of their balls and announce a value to all the other players, this may be the truth, a calculated bluff or an outrageous lie. <br>\nThis is where the 'Golden Wheels' come into the game. After the balls have been dealt to each player the screen shows the players' front balls. The human players are instructed to turn their 'Golden Wheels' to a specific numbered segment from side one, which shows what their back balls are. The players keep the contents of their segments secret as the next stage is where they discuss amongst themselves what they claim have. The player(s) then get to see what the AI players claim to have.<br>\nThe round ends with player's taking a vote on who they want to eliminate, it's perfectly possible for the human player to be eliminated. In the event of a tie there's a second vote and if there is still a tie then there's a sudden death draw which eliminates one player.<br>\nThe round ends with all players' balls being revealed.</p>\n<p>Round Two: At the start of round two the eliminated player's balls are removed from the game. The twelve balls of the remaining players ate put into a pool and two more cash balls together with one more 'Killer' are added. The balls are then distributed five per player, two front balls and three back balls. The human players are instructed to look at a segment from side two of their 'Golden Wheel' which they talk about amongst themselves, once again after discussions/bluffing has been completed the player(s) get to see what the AI opponents claim to have.<br>\nAs with round one there's a vote and one player leaves</p>\n<p>Round Three: Bin To Win At the stat of this round the five balls of the remaining two players are taken away , another 'Killer' ball is added and the eleven balls are all mixed up. The remaining players then take turns picking a ball, one player's balls are discarded while the other player's selections are added to the cash pot. However should the player building the cash pot pick a 'Killer' ball they reduce the value of the prize pot by a factor of ten making \u00a31000 into \u00a3100, \u00a3100 into \u00a310 and so on. This continues until all the balls have been selected / discarded and the game calculates the final jackpot total.</p>\n<p>Round Four: Split or Steal. The remaining two players are given two balls. Inside each ball is a word, either Split or Steal. Human players discuss strategy between each other and, again, can either tell the truth or lie. If there is an AI player the game shows a screen suggesting the probability of a SPLIT / Steal answer. After the chat the players submit one ball. * If both players submit SPLIT then the cash is shared between them</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If both players submit STEAL then neither of them gets any money</li>\n<li>If one player submits SPLIT and the other submits STEAL then the player who submitted STEAL takes all the jackpot</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's all there was to the TV show and that's all there is to the game. <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/659126/jasper-carrott/\">Jasper Carrott</a> announces the winner, the game displays half a dozen credits screens and then returns to the main menu.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>2006 FIFA World Cup</em> is a football quiz game for one or two players. \nThe quiz is played as a football match and starts with the player(s) selecting from one of ten national teams. Each match s played in a virtual stadium where the pitch is divided into ten zones. Players pass the ball from one player to the next by answering questions, easy questions are asked when the player passes within the same zone or moving forward one zone, harder questions are asked for a two zone pass and difficult questions are asked for a three zone pass. In each turn there are always four passing options available, two nearby, one that's two zones away and another that's three zones away. The same game mechanic is used for shooting at goal, the further away from the goal the player is when they decide to shoot harder the question that is asked.</p>\n<p>All questions are multiple choice with three possible answers, questions are all related to previous World Cups and include video clips followed by '\"What happened next?\"; identifying players from pixelated photos; showing pictures of two players and asking when they played together/against each other; spot the ball questions; and asking the scores of previous matches. \nDuring the game player(s) have one red card, you yellow cards and three substitution cards to play. The red card is played from the virtual pitch, when played a question is asked and if answered correctly then that player gains possession of the ball. The remaining cards are played from the question screen, the yellow card removes one of the multiple choice answers and the substitution card swaps the current question for a new one.</p>\n<p>The game has three game modes which vary slightly depending on whether they are being played as a one or two player game ;* FIFA World Cup Tournament: This mode starts at the World Cup Quarter Finals and to win the player must triumph in their quarter, semi and final match</p>\n<ul>\n<li>FIFA World Cup Final: This is a single game</li>\n<li>Penalty Shoot Out: This is also a one or two player game.<br>\nIn the single player game the player is asked five questions and they play as both attacker and goal keeper. If they answer a question correctly they get the chance to make a save by answering another question, they must score a goal and save a goal to win.<br>\nIn the two player game players take turns answering five questions - each correct answer scores a goal. <br>\nThere is a Sudden Death round which occurs if no goals are scored in single player mode or if there's a tie in the two player mode</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the single player game the match always starts with the human player in possession at the kick off and the game passes the ball back to a defender. The player answers questions until they either score a goal or get a question wrong at which point control passes to the AI opponent. This plays just the same as the human player, i.e. It signals which pass it intends to make and the player is asked a question whose difficulty is dependant upon the pass being made, here short passes generate hard questions and long passes easy ones. If the player fails to intercept the pass then the AI opponent makes another pass until either a goal is scored or the player manages to save/intercept.</p>\n<p>In a two player game there's a virtual coin toss to decide who plays first. Another difference in the two player game is the mechanic of scoring a goal, if the attacking player answers their question correctly then they have a shot on target and the defending player must answer a question to decide whether they make a save. The difficulty of the 'save question' is the reverse of the mechanic of passing, here shots taken three zones away from goal are easier to save while shots taken from in front of the goal are saved by answering a difficult question. If the game is tied when full time is reached then there's a Sudden Death round in which the first goal wins the match.</p>\n<p>The game also has a tutorial section in which the presenter explains the game mechanics, the presenter is not seen on-screen and the tutorial is not interactive. If left to it's own devices at the main menu the game will eventually display the game's credits.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Richard Hammond's Top Gear Interactive Challenge</em> is a quiz game for one player - that's the 'Billy No Mates' mode, or two players/teams - the 'Head to Head' mode. Naturally, being a game based on the 'Top Gear' TV show and hosted by one of the show's presenters, cars feature heavily in this game.</p>\n<p>There are five rounds in the game, each round is preceded by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Richard+Hammond\">Richard Hammond</a> explaining the format of the round, these explanations are optional and can be skipped. Details of the rounds follow, after each round the player(s) are shown their round score, their cumulative score and a clip from the TV show, the rounds are;* Keep Your Distance: The player is shown a series of ten photographs of parts of cars such as a bumper or a rear light. They must select the correct car make/model from the supplied list. They have sixty seconds to complete the series, a wrong answer costs five seconds while a right answer gains five points.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Under The Bonnet: The player(s) are shown footage of a car and a statistic about that vehicle such as brake horsepower, engine capacity etc. They are then shown a second car and have to decide whether the same statistic for this vehicle is higher or lower than that of the first. A correct answer scores ten points while a wrong answer scores zero. The teams take turns answering their questions and there are two questions each.</li>\n<li>The Cool Wall: Players are shown a series of six cars and must decide whether they are cool or un-cool, each correct answer scores points and getting all six correct earns a bonus of twenty points. However there is a 'jeopardy car' - a car that is so cool it's rated sub-zero - placing that car in the wrong category ends the player's turn and loses them all points scored in the round.</li>\n<li>Caravan Roulette: Six caravans are lined up in a quarry and player's take turns blowing them up. The catch is that <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Richard+Hammond\">Richard Hammond</a> is hiding in one of them, blowing up a caravan that he' NOT in scores ten points while hitting the one he's hiding in ends the round. A further twist happens when the players are left with just two caravans, player one has the option of playing or passing the control to player two, the catch here is that blowing up Mr Hammond costs the team forty points while blowing up the empty caravan scores forty points.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the single player game this round is played slightly differently, the player has to decide whether they wish to destroy three, four or five caravans for thirty, forty or fifty points. Three or more caravans scores points and the round ends if Mr Hammond is shot.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Need For Speed: Each team is asked a series of fifteen multiple choice questions, they have ten seconds per question some of which are based on a clip from the show.</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p><em>Scene It?: Comedy Movies</em> is one of a series of games in the <em>Scene It?</em> series. </p>\n<p>The box contains a folding game board, a DVD in a card slipcase, instructions, 100 trivia cards, 12 'Buzz' cards, four tokens, and two dice - one which selects the question category and one standard numbered die. In this version the four tokens are all made from yellow plastic, they are a banana skin, a rubber chicken, a joke glasses false nose &amp; moustache set and a whoopee cushion (the only one with a label printed on it). There's also an advertising foldout listing other board games, mobile games and Facebook games.</p>\n<p>The game follows the standard format of all <em>Scene It?</em> game with minor changes to the names of some parts, for example in this game the category die does not contain a Buzz symbol. Although the game's instruction screens all have an actor delivering the information in a voice-over and the movie clips include sound none of the questions are read out to the players. Questions are timed with the default for the trivia questions being thirty seconds though this can be shortened via a main menu option.</p>\n<p>It is played on the standard Scene It? 'flex-time' game board so-called because of its novel feature, when there's not enough time/interest to play a full game it can be folded, thus reducing it's size so that a short game can be played. The player(s) must travel round the board to the 'WIN' area where they must answer an 'All Play To Win' challenge. If they are successful they win the game, if not they move to the outer Final Cut circle and must successfully answer three DVD challenge questions to win. It is possible for two players to answer an 'All Play To Win' question simultaneously, in this case the DVD Tiebreaker question/challenge is used. </p>\n<p>The game is played with two dice, a six sided die that determines how far the player moves and an eight sided die which determines the question category the player will face. After the player has rolled both dice and moved their token they are asked a question, if successful they take another turn and continue to do so until they make an error. Players move before they attempt a question, the type of question the player will face is determined by the eight sided category die, they options are;<em> 'My Play': this is a DVD challenge in which typically a movie clip is shown after which the player is asked a relevant question such as Name the movie/actor/character. Following this there is an 'All Play' question which any player can answer.\n    + If the player who initially rolled the dice answers either the first or the second question correctly then their turn continues\n    + If another player answers the 'All Play' question first and correctly then they have the option of moving two spaces or drawing a Buzz card.</em> 'All Play': There are two All Play symbols on the category die, a question is asked and any player can answer, (if two player's shout the answer simultaneously then there is a DVD Tie Breaker option.) Typical questions include showing a movie clip and asking to name the film, one of the performers etc or they could be a series of clues to an actor or a film.\n    + If the player who initially rolled the dice answers first and correctly then their turn continues\n    + If another player answers first and correctly then they have the option of moving two spaces or drawing a Buzz card, control of the dice passes to the next player.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>'My Puzzle Challenges': This is a DVD puzzle question and the player needs the remote control to be able to play. Questions are multiple choice and include 'Which is the odd one out?' and 'Which item is missing from this picture' types of questions. If completed correctly the player's turn continues - if not then control of the dice passes to the nest player.</li>\n<li>'Buzz cards' are earned by answering another player's question - see above, every card carries a quotation from a film which loosely describes it's content. When one of these cards is acquired the player reads it as some cards are meant for immediate use and others are saved for later use. An example of a Buzz cards that are saved for later use are the \"You'll shoot your eye out kid\" - when any other player rolls a six this card is played causing the other player to stay put while the player holding this card moves six cells around the board.</li>\n<li>\n<p>'Trivia Challenge': Here another player draws a Trivia Challenge card and reads the question. There are three categories of trivia question each represented by a distinct symbol on the category die while on the card there is one question for each symbol on one side with the answers on the reverse. If the player answers the question correctly their turn continues and they roll again. There are three categories of trivia question, Poo Culture - described as the 'Who What When &amp; Why' questions; Songs &amp; Slogans; and Take Three where the player is given three clues to solve\nThere is also a more difficult \"Hardy-Har-Hard\" question which the player may opt to take, getting this question right allows the player to move an extra two spaces before continuing their turn</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>'Players Choice': Where the player selects a trivia card or DVD category of their choice.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The game has three timed 'Bonus Activities' mode during which it presents a series of \"Sketch It!\", \"Act It!\", and \"Say It!\" questions for a large group to play by shouting out the answers, the board is not used in this mode. In the \"Sketch It!\" one player must draw something from a film, an example being a bottle of Soul Glo from 'Coming To America', and the other players must both guess the item and the film. The \"Act It!\" tasks are similar and usually involve movie titles. The tasks come with helpful suggestions such 'Put a bra on your head and create the perfect woman' which is meant to convey the film title <em>'Weird Science'</em>. In the \"Say It!\" section one player must convey a movie title without mentioning any film title, actor, character, or director.</p>\n<p>Finally there's a 'Party Mode' which plays an endless loop of questions of all types, sound clips, pixellated pictures, film clips, cryptic clues etc. Each question is preceded by an animation and is timed, players just shout out the answer, scoring is optional and the board is not used.</p>",

The main game can be played by four player/teams, there is also a 'Party Mode' in which the game plays an endless loop of questions, each question is timed and players just shout out the answer, scoring is optional and the board is not used.</p>\n<p>The box contains; a DVD in a card slipcase; a folding game board; 175 trivia cards in an open topped card container; 16 'Buzz' cards; four quick reference cards; four player tokens (called 'movers'); instructions; and two dice - one which selects the question category and one standard numbered die. In this edition of the game the four tokens are metallic and represent a Squishee soda, the cooling towers of the Springfield power plant, a television set and a three eyed fish. </p>\n<p>The main game follows the standard format of all <em>Scene It?</em> game with minor changes to the names and some parts of the rules. All the game's instruction screens all have an actor delivering the voice-over information and the footage from the show has sound too, however none of the DVD questions are read out to the players. Questions are timed, with the default for the trivia questions being thirty seconds though this setting can be altered via a main menu option.</p>\n<p><em>Scene It?: The Simpsons</em> is played on the standard Scene It? 'flex-time' game board so-called because when there's not enough time/interest to play a full game it can be folded, thus reducing it's size so that a short game can be played. The players must travel round the board to the 'WIN' area where they must answer an 'All Play To Win' challenge. If they are successful they win the game, if not they move to the outer Final Cut circle and must successfully answer three DVD challenge questions to win. It is possible for two players to answer an 'All Play To Win' question simultaneously, in which case the DVD Tiebreaker question/challenge is used. </p>\n<p>As with all <em>Scene It?</em> games two dice are used, a six sided die that determines how far the player moves and an eight sided die which determines the question category the player will face. After the player has rolled both dice and moved their token they are asked a question, if successful they take another turn and continue to do so until they make an error. Players move before they attempt a question, the type of question the player will face is determined by the eight sided category die, the options are;* 'Buzz Card': If the player rolls this symbol on the category die then they pick up a Buzz card and follow the instructions which means moving forward or backwards two spaces after which their turn is over.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>'My Play': This is a DVD challenge in which typically a clip from the show is shown after which the player is asked a relevant question such as Name the movie/actor/character.</li>\n<li>\n<p>'All Play': There are two All Play symbols on the category die, a question is asked and any player can answer, again (if two players shout the answer simultaneously then there is a DVD Tie Breaker option.. The types of questions asked include;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Worst Movie References Ever: Where the game shows four stills from an episode are shown one at a time and the players have to name the movie being parodied</li>\n<li>Springfieldians: Here four on-screen clues to a Springfield character are revealed one at a time</li>\n<li>Pattie and Selma's Eye Test: Two pictures are shown side by side and there's just one tiny difference between them.</li>\n<li>Freaky Frame Fragments: This is a cartoon version of the pixelated picture puzzle that appears in movie based <em>Scene It?</em> games, various coloured rectangles within a picture frame gradually resolve themselves into a character from the show.</li>\n<li>I Said Whaaa?: This is an audio question in which the players have to identify who's speaking</li>\n<li>'Round Springfield: In which a picture of one of Springfield's locations is slowly revealed</li>\n<li>I Can See Your Doodle: Here a drawing on a sketch pad is slowly completed</li>\n<li>Learn Your Lines: A classic Simpson quote is written on the school blackboard and players must shout out the ending</li>\n<li>Where In The World Is Homer J?: Much like the movie parody question, four stills from an episode of the show are shown one at a time and the players have to name the location.</li>\n<li>The Wiggum Files: Three clues to a Springfield character presented as a police rap sheet.\nWith the 'All Play' questions, if the player who initially rolled the dice answers first and correctly then their turn continues. If another player answers first and correctly then they have the option of moving one space forwards or forcing another player to draw a Buzz card, control of the dice then passes to the next player.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>'Trivia Challenge': Here a player other than the player who rolled the dice player draws a Trivia Challenge card and reads the question corresponding to the symbol on the category die. There are three categories of trivia question;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eye on Springfield: Described as the 'Who, What, When &amp; Why of Springfield these questions include the following examples \"In 'Dumbbell Indemnity' what does Homer steal to help Moe keep his girlfriend?\" and \"The Channel 6 News helicopter is piloted by what Kent Brockman-hating reporter?\"</li>\n<li>The Lowest Form of Communication: These questions are about songs and dialogue from the show, example questions are \"Complete this sign over the Springfield Dog Track....\" and \"In 'G.I. Doh' what does Cleetus say when he pulls the pin on a hand grenade?\"</li>\n<li>You Might Remember Me From..: These questions are about the films, books, musicians etc referenced in the show, example questions are \"In 'Simple Simpson' who was the Pie Man's final target?\" or \"In 'When You Dish Upon A Star', Homer takes a gift basket from which real-life talent agency?\"</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>'Players Choice': Where the player selects a trivia card or DVD category question of their choice.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If left alone for a while the game enters 'screen saver' mode. Both the main game and the party game are liberally interspersed with further clips from the show.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Indiana Jones DVD Adventure Game</em> is a family board game for one to four players with interactive DVD elements.</p>\n<p>The game comes in a card box which contains twenty-four temple tiles; one 'Hall of Ancients' start tile; four Indiana Jones plastic figures - each a different colour; thirty-six cardboard gold coins; five cardboard gold medallions; a DVD in a card slip-case; an eight sided die; three relics - the Ark, the Sankara Stones, and the Holy Grail; three cardboard boulders; forty 'Fortune &amp; Glory' cards and a game manual designed to look like Indiana's journal.</p>\n<p>The game starts with each player placing their Indiana Jones figure on it's starting point in the Hall of Ancients - one of the four coloured squares in the centre. After this they take two gold coins and two 'Fame &amp; Fortune' cards keeping them all face down so that opponent's can't see them. Players take turns rolling the octahedral die and moving the appropriate number of spaces, when they come to the end of the Hall of Ancients tile they take a temple tile from the face-down stack and extend the playing area by laying down more pathways.* If the player lands on, or passes over, a 'trap square' then they use the DVD to complete a Trap Challenge. Typically the DVD shows two numbered die and the player has five seconds to roll the game die to match both. If the player matched both they take two Fame &amp; Fortune cards and survive, if they matched one they take one card and survive.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the player lands on, or passes over, a combat square they use the DVD to complete the Combat Challenge, winning a fight earns the player gold coins. There are two forms of this challenge, the player either has to roll the die and get a number higher than the number the game shows in which case they take two coins from the coin pile, or they challenge another player and must beat their roll in which case they take two coins from that player.</li>\n<li>If the player lands on, or passes over, a secret passage square they use the DVD to see if it is open or not, it open they can move to any other secret passage on the board. If the door is closed the player continues their turn usually after following an instruction such as \"Swap two cards with another player\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During this phase of the game the DVD will warn of unpredictable events and players must follow the commands of the spirits.</p>\n<p>If a player enters a relic chamber, which they cannot enter unless they have either the correct gold coins, a medallion or a skeleton key though sometimes the game randomly won't let them enter and doesn't ask if they have the requisite items. If they are able to enter they must use the DVD to undertake a Relic Challenge. There are three relics;<em> The Holy Grail: There are three challenges to be completed here, the Penitent Man; The Iehova Challenge; and the Grail Challenge which are the three tests faced in the </em>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade* film incorporating film clips from each</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Stones of Sankarra: This challenge is based on the mine cart race in the film <em>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</em>, the left/right arrows on the remote steer while the up/down arrows drop debris on the pursuers</li>\n<li>The Holy Grail: One of the perils Indiana Jones faces in the film <em>The Ark of the Covenant: Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> is a buried Egyptian temple where the floor is covered by snakes. This challenge is based on that, the player must navigate a path through the snakes to retrieve the relic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When all three have been collected the players head back to the Hall of Ancients. During this phase the temple will be collapsing and the DVD will instruct players to remove parts of the temple, the temple tiles each have a letter A-H on them, if a player's Indiana Jones is on the tile removed then their game is over - they can make no more moves but they could still win.</p>\n<p>The object of the game is to arrive back in the Hall of Ancients with the most gold. There's a gold bonus for getting back first, with smaller bonuses for being second or third; there's the gold coins and medallions collected; Fame &amp; Fortune cards are exchanged for gold as are relics. Players add up the total and the highest score wins.</p>",

The DVD contains thirty races all filmed at Swindon dog track</p>\n<p>At the start of the game players are given \u00a36,000 in game money to bet with, they then load the DVD and watch <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/873307/john-francome/\">John Francome</a> introduce the game from Cheltenham racecourse, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/873307/john-francome/\">John</a> also optionally explains the game in detail for those who have not played it before</p>\n<p>When a race is selected from the race menu the DVD shows a race sheet with the names of the runners, their odds and their form or previous race history over which <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/873307/john-francome/\">John Francome</a>'s voice can be heard giving his tips for the upcoming race. The nominated bookie writes the names and the odds on the bookmaker's slate and takes bets from the players, players are allowed two bets per race. \nThere are six runners in a greyhound race and bets are made on the first two to cross the finish line. The game allows three types of bet, betting on a dog to win, an each-way bet which bets that a dog will finish either first or second, and a forecast bet in which the player predicts the dogs that will finish first and second.\nWhen all bets have been made the DVD remote is used to press the on-screen 'Ready To Race' button and the film of the race is shown with full commentary and a replay of the last few seconds as the winner crosses the line. The game then announces the winners and, as an aid to the bookie, it states what the return of a successful \u00a3100 bet would be.</p>\n<p>There are DVD Extras included with this game;* John's Greyhound Funnies in which <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/873307/john-francome/\">John Francome</a> tells a series of greyhound related jokes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extra betting slips - there's a .pdf file on the DVD which can be printed when the betting slip pad is exhausted</li>\n<li>A glossary of greyhound racing terms</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p><em>Trivial Pursuit DVD: Star Wars Saga Edition</em> is a family quiz game for two to four players or teams (or two to twenty-four players according to the blurb on the box lid). The game carries a U-Universal rating but the makers suggest it's suited to players aged ten to adult.</p>\n<p>The game comes in a large oblong box that contains a fold-out game board, one die, two DVDs in a card wallet, twenty-four scoring wedges and four shiny metal character tokens Darth Vader; Luke Skywalker; Yoda and A N Other (probably Anakin Skywalker but the tokens are not labelled). The four characters are mounted on black token holders, when a question is answered correctly the appropriate coloured wedge is slotted into the base. Players have the choice of playing a traditional came based on the card questions or a game from the DVD, unlike many DVD titles the two forms are completely independent.</p>\n<p>There are two discs each with ten separate games on them so the DVD questions do not get repeated and there's a space in the card wallet that holds the DVDs to record the name of the winner of each quiz. All questions appear as text on screen and on the question menu screen there is an option to enable speech so that the questions are spoken. Naturally the usual question categories of history, science etc don't apply in this game, these are the question categories used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blue - The Cantina: these questions are about specific scenes, cameo roles and alien races.</li>\n<li>Pink - The Force: this features scenes in which the Force is used or referred to.</li>\n<li>Yellow - Heroes, Villains &amp; Scoundrels: the title says it all.</li>\n<li>Brown - The Saga: these questions are about the movie plots, sub plots and story arcs.</li>\n<li>Green - A Galaxy Far Away: a category devoted to the towns, cities, planets and galaxies of the Star Wars universe - at least the movie versions.</li>\n<li>Orange - Wildcard: a sort of miscellaneous group</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All questions are timed, initially the person who rolled the die gets to answer to question but when the timer runs down to just five seconds remaining there's a sound and the screen changes to show that the question is now open to any player to answer. When the timer has expired the answer is revealed and whoever answered correctly gains a coloured wedge. When a player wins a game the DVD shows a sequence of celebratory clips from the movies followed by the game's credits.</p>\n<p>Both discs have the same introductory sequence and both contain bonus material in the form of another quiz.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Golden Compass: DVD Adventure Board Game</em> is a DVD board game for two to four players that is based on the film <em>The Golden Compass</em>. This is a co-operative game in which all players work together to help Lyra cross the ice bridge which is the final destination on the sixth game area. The game has two levels of difficulty, Beginners and Advanced.</p>\n<p>The game submitted comes in a tin measuring 28cm x 27cm x 7.5cm which contains three game characters - Lyra, Mrs Coulter, and Lord Asriel; one DVD in a card slipcase, a three page foldout Quick Start Guide; a twenty four page manual; twenty-five Daemon cards; twenty-five strength/reinforcement cards; a game board; six game fields - three arched boards with a different game field on each side; Fabric Chips and a Credit Meter. The game board is circular and when not in use folds into a quadrant. The Credit Meter is assembled from eight curved strips which fit together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, these fit around the main game board almost, but not quite, encircling it.</p>\n<p>The game follows the story of the film which is set in a parallel universe where souls have visible form, daemon or animal. It is centred on the journey of a young orphan girl called Lyra as she goes in search of her uncle Lord Asreil who is somewhere in the far north of the world researching the Northern Lights. Opposing her are the\u00a0world's ruler the Magisterium\u00a0who opposes free will and Mrs.\u00a0Coulter a powerful baddie who, in the film, is involved in something to do with missing children.</p>\n<p>In a player's turn they can collect daemon or strength cards, fight a villain or move Lyra. Players use up a daemon card in order to move Lyra. When fighting the DVD shows a picture of the villain with numbers in each of the corners, some numbers refer to the villains strength while others show how much honour is gained by victory. Players use a combination of their strength cards to beat the villain, other players can assist by donating their strength cards but for this they expect a share of the honour. Losing a fight costs honour and may result in Mrs Coulter moving closer towards Lyra. If Mrs Coulter catches up with Lyra at any point during the game then everyone loses. </p>\n<p>Once Lyra has reached the ice bridge the game enters its final stage which is played out entirely on the DVD. The DVD shows a sequence of ten symbols which the players must memorise as they must recreate the sequence in order to help Lyra cross the bridge. The player with the most honour/credit always plays first but with each mistake they lose some honour until eventually they are no longer the leader and someone else takes over. The game ends when the final symbol is identified, the DVD shows Lyra crossing the bridge and the player with the most honor at that point wins the game.</p>\n<p>The DVD has a detailed set of instructions delivered by voice over, it also has a film trailer and a choice of languages - English, Dutch, German, French. Spanish and Australian. The English and Australian voice over s, for each language selection the DVD shows different company logos before the cinematic introduction sequence.</p>",

The game comes in a large card box measuring 27cm x 27cm x 5cm looking like a traditional board game, inside are four Countdown pencils, a pad of plain paper with a Countdown front page, and a DVD in a keepcase.</p>\n<p>There are two game modes on the DVD, Classic Countdown and the Conundrum game:* Classic Countdown follows the same format as the television game, it has three sections:\n    + Sections one and section two have four Letters Rounds followed by one Numbers Round.\n    + Section Three has three Letters Rounds, followed by one Numbers Round and one Conundrum round.  </p>\n<p>In Classic Countdown mode the DVD keeps score for the players, totalling the lengths of the words found, how close the players were in the Numbers round etc and at the end it announces the winner.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Conundrum Game: Is a series of five conundrums at the end of which players are given their 'Conumdrum Rating - this is based on the number of correct solutions claimed and the speed with which they were solved.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Letters Round: here players try to make the longest possible word from a random selection of letters. Nine random letters are drawn by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/874488/carol-vorderman/\">Carol Vorderman</a>. There's a pause giving the players time to copy the letters onto their notepad before it disappears from screen as the action cuts to presenter <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/7685/desmond-lynam/\">Des Lynam</a> and the Countdown clock starts ticking away thirty seconds. When the time is up the players are each asked the number of letters in the longest word they could make. <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/7685/desmond-lynam/\">Des</a> then gives the longest words that could have been made and it's onto the next round.</p>\n<p>The Numbers Round: where the players are given a selection of numbers and have to use addition, subtraction, multiplication and division to devise a calculation that will match a randomly chosen target.  </p>\n<p>Once again <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/874488/carol-vorderman/\">Carol Vorderman</a> is called into action, this time drawing six random numbers and running CECIL, the numbers machine, to generate a target. As before there's a pause giving players time to copy it all down before <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/7685/desmond-lynam/\">Des</a> starts the timer.<br>\nWhen the timer expires the players are each asked how close to the target number their calculations got after which <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/874488/carol-vorderman/\">Carol Vorderman</a> explains the best answer step by step.</p>\n<p>The Conundrum Round: this round is introduced by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/7685/desmond-lynam/\">Des</a>. A nine letter word has been scrambled and its the player(s) job to unscramble it within thirty seconds, there's always just one possible solution to these challenges. In this game the player to shout out the answer and stop the clock, i.e. press the DVD controller button, wins the points.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Scene It?: Twilight</em> is one of a series of games in the <em>Scene It?</em> series, the full game is intended for two to four players but has party-play options too. The voice acting is by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/877287/peter-facinelli/\">Peter Facinelli</a> who plays Dr. Carlisle Cullen in the film</p>\n<p>The box contains a folding game board; a DVD in a book-fold card case; a single sheet of instructions - printed both sides; four tokens, two dice - one which selects the question category and one standard numbered die which determines how many places the player's token will move; four reference cards - one per player; thirty 'Fate' cards and one hundred trivia cards. In this version the four tokens are all made from metal, they are a house, a baseball, a grand piano, and a car. There's also a registration card and an advertisement for other <em>Scene it?</em> board games.</p>\n<p>The game broadly follows the standard format of all <em>Scene It?</em> game, however there are changes to the way the game is played, some minor and some quite significant. Minor changes often occur from game to game and typically include the renaming of some game elements, for example in this game the Buzz symbol and Buzz cards have been replaced by Fate symbol and Fate cards. More significantly this game is not played on the standard <em>Scene It?</em> 'flex-time' game board but on a smaller board that is the equivalent of the short game in other <em>Scene It?</em> titles, another major change in the game is that <em>Scene It?: Twilight</em> consists of fifteen different pre-set games. </p>\n<p>After the player has rolled both dice and moved their token round the board they are given their challenge, as indicated by the category die. If successful they take another turn and continue rolling the dice and moving until they either fail a challenge, roll the Fate card symbol or reach the STOP area of the board. The challenges are:* Trivia Card Challenge: there are three trivia symbols on the category die each of which corresponds to a symbol on the trivia card. When a player rolls one of these symbols another player takes a card from the trivia deck and reads the appropriate question, the answers are on the reverse of the card.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>'DVD Challenge': there are three DVD challenge symbols on the category die. When rolled the player's use the DVD to fins out what the next question is and, because the DVD contains fifteen pre-set games, the players have no control over which type of challenge they face, the challenges are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>'Mini Game Challenges': these are two DVD puzzles which only the dice roller can attempt, in one the player must remember the order of nine pictures in a 3x3 grid while the second is a kind of shell game with a baseball underneath one of three baseball caps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>'Fate': There are two Fate symbols on the category die, when a player rolls one of them they draw a Fate Card, act on it and their turn ends. Players can also be forced to take a Fate card when another player wins an All Play challenge.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>'My Play': In this challenge only the player who rolled the dice can answer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>'All Play': As the category name suggests any player can answer these questions, (if two player's shout the answer simultaneously then there is a DVD Tie Breaker option).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If the player who initially rolled the dice answers first and correctly then their turn continues.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If another player answers first and correctly then they have the option of moving two spaces or forcing another player to draw a Fate card, control of the dice passes to the next player.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Typical questions for the 'My Play' and 'All Play' categories are\n    - Name the Location / Name the Character where players are shown a partially completed word grid like those used in <em>Jeopardy</em></p>\n<pre><code>- Sequentials - putting scenes from the film in order\n\n- On Reflection - where the players are shown a distorted picture that gradually becomes clearer.\n\n- Other questions follow a clip from the film and can be 'Complete This Quote'; 'Who Said What'; an observation question based on the clip or detailed Twilight trivia knowledge such as 'Edward became a vampire in what year?\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When a player reaches the 'STOP' area they face an 'All Play To Win' challenge. If the dice roller answers successfully they win the game, if they are unsuccessful they move from the STOP area to the outer ring of the Twilightning area (this is the equivalent of the Final Cut area in other games), players in the Twilightning area must successfully answer three DVD challenge questions to win. If another player answers 'All Play To Win' question successfully they can either move forward three places of force another player to take a Fate card. </p>\n<p>The DVD also holds a 'New Moon' movie trailer has additional modes of play:* Shuffle Play: here the game asks a continuous series of questions for group/party play. The board is not used and anyone can shout out the answer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Mini-Games: A continuous series of the mini games previously described.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bonus Activities: there are three of these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Which Cullen are you? - This single player activity is a personality quiz where the player answers five questions such as 'What do you think of when you think of love?' and 'What does family mean to you?' and the game matches the answers to a character from the series</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Read My Mind - A five round, two player game where one player selects a picture from those shown on screen and the other has to guess their selection.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scene It? Twilight Party - This is NOT a playable activity, it is a reference to a DVD file in .pdf format which contains party invitations, instructions on how to organise a party, recipes and so forth.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p>The Beano is a long running UK comic that first started in 1938 and, in 2017, is still going. This title, the <em>Beano Interactive DVD</em> is a compilation containing a comic with single player mini-games plus a collection of Beano cartoons</p>\n<p>The comic tells the story of some baddies who are out to demolish the venerable Bash Street School. At first the Bash Street Kids are all for this because it means they will get a theme park instead but quickly uncover a dastardly plot and set out to thwart it. The full story has seven chapters, the first six of which contain a puzzle which, when solved, yields a letter of the password that unlocks chapter seven.</p>\n<p>The player can also read the comic one chapter at a time or they can play the games directly from the menu however they only get the letters that unlock the final chapter by playing through the full comic. The puzzles are;* Chapter 1: The Big Bust Up where the player helps Teacher reassemble a shattered statue</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chapter 2: Smiffy's Quiz Swizz, here the objective is to lose</li>\n<li>Chapter 3: Rodger's Dodge Decoy where the player has to sneak past security guards</li>\n<li>Chapter 4: Minnie's Mobile Malarkey a picture matching puzzle</li>\n<li>Chapter 5: Diggit! In which the player helps Gnasher find treasure</li>\n<li>Chapter 6: Windscreen Wipeout in which Dennis the Menace splats a digger with rotten tomatoes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The game has music, sound effects and in some places background cheering but no spoken words, the comic text appears in speech bubbles accompanied by a sort of 'Nyah-nyah-nie-nee-nyah' parody of the spoken voice.</p>\n<p>The DVD also contains eight Beano cartoons 'The Snowman Party'; The New School'; 'Jelly Babies'; 'It's A Dad's Life'; 'Dennis Meets His Match'; 'Flutterby'; 'On Safari'; and 'Bag Those Pipes'.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>TV &amp; Satellite Week Presents: The Big TV &amp; Movie Quiz</em> is a cover mount DVD quiz game. As quizzes go this is a small one with a bank of just five hundred questions which form five twenty-question rounds in each of the following categories; Action, Movies, Comedy, Sci-Fi, and Family. The rounds can be played in any order either by a single player or by teams. Some of the questions have associated pictures but there are neither audio clips nor video sequences in this quiz.</p>\n<p>The questions are not timed and are all multiple choice with four possible answers. When a selection is made the game tells the player(s) if their answer was right or wrong. When all twenty questions have been answered the game shows the correct answers to all the questions in that round. </p>\n<p>The game has a short loop of music that plays over the main menu and the category selection menu.</p>",

Players use Ben's Omnitrix to determine how many spaces around they move on each turn. On some spaces there are mini game challenges which, if completed successfully, will add an alien power to the Omnitrix. On other spaces there are hazards which can send the player back to the start or rob them of one of their acquired super powers. The first player to collect all superpowers is the winner.</p>\n<p>Throughout the game there are background music, sound effects and a running commentary from Ben 10.</p>",

In the multiplayer game the team names are Betty's Hotshots and Dierdre's Dynamos, in a single player game the player plays as a member of Betty's Hotshots. Each game consists of five, four question rounds. At the end of each round the scores for tha preceding round are announced, after round two the cumulative score|(s) are also announced. in multiplayer games the team that is in the lead is announced.</p>\n<p>The rounds are;* Round 1: Celebrities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Round 2: General Knowledge</li>\n<li>Round 3: Roy's Random Round.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Round 4: History &amp; Geography* Round 5: Entertainment</p>\n<p>Each round has a different style, i.e. the questions have the same multiple choice format but the background and presentation is different. Questions can be identify disguised celebrity faces of people from the past, what is a celebrities real name etc, they may use a film clip, a sound clip, a still picture or nothing at all.</p>\n<p>In a single player game the player presses the arrow on the remote that corresponds to the answer on screen. At the end of the game the total score is announced, there's a short video sequence showing Antony Cotton tidying up the pub after everyone has gone, the credits role and the game is over.</p>\n<p>In a multiplayer game both teams answer the same question. Betty's Hotshots are the team that always goes first and they must answer using the remote without the other team seeing what answer they select. In the multiplayer game Round 3: Roy's Random Round is played differently - the question is asked of both teams together and the first team to shout out the answer wins the point. After the final round the cumulative scores are shown, the winning team is announced,</p>",

A trivia game is accessed under the Special Features menu of the DVD. The game is known on the DVD as the \"Full House Trivia Challenge\". The player is given questions based around the Full House series, storyline and cast, and is given a few possible answers. When the player gets it correct (e.g. the player is given a question about DJ's full first name, and selects \"Donna Jo\" from the list of possible answers), the game will advance to the next question until there are no more left. After that, the DVD will return to the Special Features menu where the player has selected the trivia game from.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Beat the Intro 3</em> is a music quiz with single player and multiplayer modes.</p>\n<p>The Quick Fire game is a single player game. Each round consists of six timed, multiple choice, questions. If the player gets any of them wrong the round ends immediately, if they answer all six correctly they are shown the time they took to complete the round and that's the time they should aim to beat when they play the game again. All the questions here are introductions to pop songs.</p>\n<p>The Multiplayer game is for two, three or four players/teams. Unlike the Quick Fire round the questions are not all based on the first few bars of pop songs. In this game questions are grouped into segments. Part one is a timed question based on either a song introduction, a song lyric or a pixellated blurred picture of an artist. If the player answers this correctly they are then asked three related trivia questions such as 'What year was the song released?'; 'Which album was the song on?', 'Who did the artist collaborate with?' etc. Each team completes all six of their segments for which a points score is given. When all players have completed their round of questions the game announces the winner.</p>\n<p>Both games allow the players to answer questions based on a specific decade, the 50's &amp; 60's, 70's, 80's, 90s &amp; 00s, or a random selection. All instructions are written, there is no voice-over in this game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Catchphrase</em> is an interactive DVD game that is based on a UK TV game show.</p>\n<p>The game comes in a square card box with a hinged lid. Inside the box contains pencils, Catch Phrase cards, a notepad and a DVD keep case. The box art refers to a 'free bonus edition' also known as the 'travel edition' of the game, this is played using the Bonus Game Cards, notepad and pencil, any number of players can play this game. </p>\n<p>The main game, however, is played from the DVD and is for two players/teams referred to as Pink and Blue. The nature of the TV game is that the first person to press the buzzer gets to answer the question, to simulate this the game instructions specify that the two players/teams should sit apart, Blue on the left and Pink on the right, and that when either side thinks they know the answer they must grab the DVD remote and press their team's arrow button.</p>\n<p>There are three rounds to the game;* Round 1: In this round the teams are shown a picture representing a well known phrase or saying and must guess the phrase within the twenty second time limit. There are two ways to score;\n    + Seize the remote, press the left/right button for either the pink/blue team and then shout out the answer. If the answer is correct twenty pints are won, if the answer is incorrect then twenty points go to the other side\n    + Within the time limit just shout out an answer. If that proves to be the correct answer when the time limit expires then ten points are won, if it is incorrect no points are awarded to the other side. The round consists of four to six questions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Round 2: In this round the catchphrases divided into squares which are revealed one at a time. At the start of a question the catchphrase is worth one hundred points but this score drops by ten points as each portion of the picture is shown. As in round one players grab the remote, select their team and give their answer, if they are correct they score the remaining points, if they are incorrect the points go to the other side. This round also consists of four to six catchphrases.</li>\n<li>Round 3: This is the Super Catchphrase Round. Here the board is divided into a 3x3 grid. The object is to solve a catchphrase puzzle in each cell to make a row across the board, the puzzles are shown immediately as in round one. Whichever side is in the lead at the start of the round goes first, if they succeed they win the game, if they fail the other side gets to play the round. Thinking time in this round is limited to thirty seconds for all puzzles combined.</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Greatest TV Trivia Quiz</em> is a UK DVD game for up to four players/teams. It is based exclusively on shows from the first fifty years of the ITV network (1955-2005)</p>\n<p>The teams are referred to by the colours red, green, blue and yellow. The game is played over three rounds. At the start of each round the players/teams are asked a question in turn until each has had a chance to answer three questions. When it is their turn the player has the option to answer an easy, medium or hard question worth one, two or three points respectively. The round ends with three 'All Play' questions in which the first to shout out the answer is the only player who takes part. \nRound three is identical in format to rounds one and two but the scoring is different because in this round a player can win one, two or three points for a correct answer but will lose points for an incorrect answer. The game maintains the scores for all teams, no need for a pencil and paper.</p>\n<p>The game has music more-or-less throughout, the game is hosted by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Neil+Fox\">Neil Fox</a> who appears for the introduction, instructions, at the start of each round and congratulations at the end of the game, during the game his voice can be heard saying things like '\"Well Done!\" after random questions.</p>\n<p>Typical questions will show a still picture or a short video clip, the question could be about something that happened in the clip, a character's name, someone who appeared in the show or in a spin-off show. Other questions include identifying a shoe from a catchphrase, an actor/character from a jumbled picture and so on</p>",

Answering is done in turn by two or three players, usually it requires to choose one answer out of four available options, with points being awarded for correct choices. The first person to gain four points 'conquers' the city, and then the game goes to the next city in the list. The winner is the player who is the first to 'take over' four cities.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Music Hosted By Martin Kemp</em> is an interactive quiz game featuring <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/913541/martin-kemp/\">Martin Kemp</a> former bassist with <em>Spandau Ballet</em> and successful actor. It has twelve separate games each with seven rounds, when played as a single player game only the first six rounds are available 'to stop anyone memorising all the answers'.</p>\n<p>The game is set in an American diner with each option on the main menu taking the player to a different section, for example the game selection screen is the diner's jukebox.</p>\n<p>The rounds in the game are:* Round 1: Popwatch. The game shows a video clip and asks a related question. All questions are shown on the screen while the clip is played and when the clip ends <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/913541/martin-kemp/\">Martin Kemp</a> reads the question for the player.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Round 2: What's That Tune? This is a single question 'Beat the iItro' type of round where the player(s) score one point for naming the song and another for naming the artist.</li>\n<li>Round 3: Logical Order. There are two questions in this round in which the player is shown three pictures and is asked a question, they must place the pictures in the correct order. A typical question would show pictures of three singers and ask in what order they started their music careers, or put three artists in order of age - <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/913541/martin-kemp/\">Martin Kemp</a> names the people in the pictures in case the player(s) cannot identify them.</li>\n<li>Round 4: Name the Singer or Band. Another two question round in which the players are shown pixellated pictures and must identify the artist(s).</li>\n<li>Round 5: Multiple Choice. This round consists of ten questions each with four potential answers, typical questions would be 'X was a guitarist with which band?' or 'Which city appears in the song Put Your Hands Up for ...?'</li>\n<li>Round 6: Pop the Question. Ten questions in this round too but there's no multiple choice answers to choose from.</li>\n<li>Round 7: Think the Link. Two questions in which the game shows two pictures which have to be decoded to reveal a song title, the players also have to name the artist or band.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the final round the player(s) have to swap score sheets and mark each other's answers as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/913541/martin-kemp/\">Martin Kemp</a> reveals them an, just in case the game ends in a tie. each game has a tie-break question.</p>\n<p>Some rounds will be declared to be 'Negative Scoring' which means that one point is deducted for each wrong answer, likewise some rounds may be declared 'Double Scoring', when these pop up they apply to just one team for one round. At the end of each round the player(s) are given the chance to either continue or play the round again.</p>\n<p>Though the game is hosted by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/913541/martin-kemp/\">Martin Kemp</a> he is present in voice over only and does not actually appear on screen. Players need to keep their own score and there is a score sheet on the DVD which can be printed off via a computer, instructions on where to find it are in the Extras menu which also contains an interview with Martin Kemp and details of the Golden Golf Charitable Trust which received a portion of the revenue from the sale of the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the classic film The Lion King, this movie focuses on primarily Timon and Pumbaa's view on the various events that occurred in the original movie. Throughout the movie, Timon meets back up with his family, and both Timon and Pumbaa must become a father-like figure to Simba after his father passes away. The original DVD release (re-releases remove most if not all of them) contains four games accessed on Disc 2:</p>\n<p>\u2022 Timon and Pumbaa's Virtual Safari 1.5: This 8 minute journey follows Timon and Pumbaa, along with their families, on a fun-filled ride created by themselves. The interactive part of the safari comes when you must choose a path. There are many paths to choose from, all based on rides found at the actual Disney theme parks. The adventure can be played many different times and still have different outcomes.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Who Wants to Be King of the Jungle: This parody of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" is hosted by Meredith Vieira. As Timon, you must guess all of the Lion King related questions correctly in order to become the king of the jungle. You can also \"Phone an Animal\" or \"Poll the Herd\" if you are unsure of the answer, which you can use three times. However, the herd is not always correct, so make sure to use your lifelines carefully.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Find the Face: Many familiar Disney characters are coming to see the premiere of Timon and Pumbaa's brand new movie. You are tasked by Timon to find exactly who's in the audience. Use the silhouettes seen in the audience and pick the correct Disney character. The goal is to get as many correct as you can.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Hidden Mickey Hunt: For years, many different Disney movies have had Mickey Mouse ears hidden throughout the movie. When you play the movie in this mode, there will be 20 new pairs of Mickey ears to find. When the ears show up, an symbol will show up on screen, giving you 30 seconds to find it. At the end, you can go back and look at the Mickey ears that you have found. All of the answers were originally available on the movie's website.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Read Along With Postman Pat</em> is an educational title for young children. The main part of this title are two Postman Pat stories which are accessed via the <em>Pat's Diary</em> option from the main menu, they are;<em> </em>Postman Pat's Sleepy Days* which tells the story of a week in Pat's life when he could not get to sleep. At the end of the story there's a summary of the tale followed by a short animation featuring key words after which Pat shows some flash cards and asks for help reading them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Postman Pat's Three Wishes. This is the shorter of the stories and tells the tale of a day when Pat wished he could fly like a bird, run as fast as a dog and swim like a fish. At the end of this tale there is no 'flash card' sequence as in the previous story.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both stories were released in 1994 on a VHS video tape called <em>Read Along With Postman Pat</em> and, apart from the addition of a menu <em>Postman Pat's Sleepy Days</em> they appear unchanged. The credits at the end of the DVD stories are the same as the credits of the VHS tape and are also dated 1994.</p>\n<p>This DVD title also has a <em>Fun With Pat</em> section which contains some interactive games, the full contents of this section are;* Comic Strip: This is a short story in comic form with one or two panes to the screen. Beneath the pictures are short sentences and a speaker button which, if clicked on, gives the child the spoken sentence</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Colour Your Picture: Three pictures that could be printed via a p.c. Together with an invitation to send them to become part of the great Postman Pat exhibition.</li>\n<li>Pats Bag: Pat is emptying a letter box in the country when he drops his letters. The child clicks on a letter and this brings up a screen with a picture on the right while on the left is are eight words, the child must select the word that matches the picture. There are four letters per game and at the end the child gets a 'Well Done' message</li>\n<li>Choose A Shape: This is a single screen with three animals in it together with three outline shapes. A question mark appears in one of the outlines and the child must select the creature that matches the outline. Each correct answer triggers a short animation showing the animal together with the appropriate word. When all three have been answered correctly there's another 'Well Done' screen accompanied by a lot of cheering.</li>\n</ul>",

In this game the player is shown a pattern of bricks in the wall and on the right are three shields each with a similar pattern but only one of which matches the pattern Despereaux has to climb. To complete this challenge the player must select the correct shield with the remote over three rounds.</li>\n<li>The second challenge is to help Despereaux jump over a line of mouse traps using a catapult made from a spoon. In the first round there is a single catapult which is drawn back to fire Despereaux over the traps. Beneath the catapult is an indicator which flashes when the catapult is at the correct setting so the player's challenge is to press the button on the remote at just the right time. On the second round there are two catapults so the player must press the remote's button when both indicators flash, and in the third round there are three catapults so there are three indicators to watch</li>\n<li>The third challenge sees Despereaux fight the rats, which is reduced to three rounds of rock, paper, scissors</li>\n<li>Challenge four is a set of three 'spot the difference rounds' in which the player must select the odd key from a set of five</li>\n<li>To finally complete the quest and free the princess the final task is to arrange three mirrors so that the bounce light through the dungeon and scare away the rats* Build-A-Boldo Game: Boldo is the magic soup genie who helps the chef in the movie, he's made from vegetables and bits of kitchenalia.

Their objective is to give the top answers that the public gave. Each answer scores points depending on the percentage of the public who gave the same answer. If a team gives three wrong answers their opponents get a chance to 'steal' the points earned so far. </p>\n<p>In addition to the basic round, described above, there's also a 'Double Money' round, the game ends with the winning team putting forward two members who play in a timed round to try and win the game's jackpot prize in the 'Big Money'.</p>\n<p>The DVD game follows a similar format but makes a few changes to the mechanics of the game: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Round One:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Question One is always directed at Team A who have thirty seconds to write down what they consider to be the top five answers, during those thirty seconds Team B must write down a single answer. When the time is up the players reveal the correct answers one at a time and Team A score points for every correct answer they have no matter what order they wrote they were written down. The number of points scored for a correct answer, as in the TV show, depends on the number of people who gave the answer.<br>\nIf Team A gives five correct answers then they win the round, and the points, outright. If an answer appears which Team A did not write down then Team B have a chance to steal the points, this happens if Team B's answer is present in the answer Team A dindn't guess or any of the remaining answers.</li>\n<li>Question Two is the same as Question One with the question being directed to Team B.</li>\n<li>Question Three is a <em>Viewer's Question</em> round which is directed at both teams. This is a simple question with a choice of three answers. The teams select have only fifteen seconds of thinking/discussion time to make their choice and score fifty points if correct.  </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Round Two follows is similar to Round One:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This round starts with a question directed at Team B and this is followed with a question directed at Team A</li>\n<li>Question Three is a <em>Double Money</em> question directed at Team A and Question 4 is a <em>Double Money</em> question directed at Team B  </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The game's final round, as in the TV show, is the <em>Big Money</em> round. In this DVD game the <em>Big Money</em> round is played by both teams, however the team in the lead at the start of the round gets to answer all five questions while the team in second/last place is only allowed to answer the first four. <br>\nFive questions are asked and the teams must put down just one answer to each.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the end of the <em>Big Money</em> round the team with the most points wins.</p>\n<p>The game uses <em>random DVD technology</em> which gives a different game each time it is played. If a previously played game is presented the player(s) can select a new game via the game's menu screen. The game does not keep score for the teams, all totals are reckoned manually.</p>\n<p>The package includes an instruction booklet and two 'wipe clean' score cards (wipe clean for felt tip pens but not for biro or pencil). The game does not feature an on-screen presenter nor does it use the music from the TV show. It does claim to feature <em>the famous 'Uh-Uh' wrong answer sound</em> and uses <em>Macrovision</em> copy protection.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Frankie Dettori Champion Stakes: The No1 Horse Racing Game</em> is a family horse racing game. Inside the case are two pads of betting slips, an 'Odds Table' card, a DVD and, in the copy submitted here, a competition entry for a holiday.</p>\n<p>The DVD starts with an introduction from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/928071/frankie-dettori/\">Frankie Dettori</a> who helps player's through the game setup. The first task, according to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/928071/frankie-dettori/\">Frankie Dettori</a>, is to appoint someone trustworthy as the game's bookie and to give a betting slip to each player.</p>\n<p>Playing the game starts with selection of the racecourse, there are ten real courses to choose from, after which <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/928071/frankie-dettori/\">Frankie Dettori</a> pops up to describe the course a little bit, then it's on to the races. There are three races per course and each is run the same way.  </p>\n<p>Initially the details of each horse scroll across the screen and the bookie makes a note of the name and the odds. All players then write the name of the horse they select, the kind of bet - win or place, and the amount of the bet on their betting slip. For those unfamiliar with betting there's an on-screen option which will bring <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/928071/frankie-dettori/\">Frankie Dettori</a> to the fore to explain how the bets work, he also shows a few worked examples.</p>\n<p>Once the betting slips have been handed to the bookie the button on the remote is pressed and the race is run. These races are NOT animations of computer generated in any way, they are recordings of actual races run at real race courses.\nWhen a race is over the winners are announced, the bookie does all the calculations and payouts manually, and the next race is started. When al three races from the chosen racecourse have been run the players are returned to the racecourse menu for another session.</p>\n<p>There's an <em>Extras</em> menu which contains;* <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/928071/frankie-dettori/\">Frankie Dettori</a> explaining how to bet - this is also available in-game</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Frankie's Magnificent Seven: Video clips from 28th September 1992 when <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/928071/frankie-dettori/\">Frankie Dettori</a> won all seven races on the card at Ascot</li>\n<li>Racing Jargon: <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/928071/frankie-dettori/\">Frankie Dettori</a> pops up again to introduce a couple of screens of text containing betting and racing phrases and their meanings</li>\n<li>An option to print more betting slips</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to the packaging somewhere on the disc are <em>Hidden Bloopers</em>.</p>",

The story behind the game is that the SS Hawking a space exploration vessel, and SS Ark a space station studying alien life, have encountered an uncharted wormhole and has been flung across the galaxy. To get home the players must answer twenty questions correctly. </p>\n<p>The questions categories include Literature, Aliens &amp; Monsters, Planets &amp; Worlds, Amazing Craft, Robots, Crazy Science, Earth in Peril and The Early Years. A category can only be used once per game. Once the category has been selected players are asked questions in turn by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tom+Baker\">Tom Baker</a> after which the scene shifts to Amy where the player chooses from four possible answers. If they answer correctly they move closer to Earth, if not they stay where they are. When a question is answered incorrectly the players are NOT shown the correct answer.   </p>\n<p>The super-massive black hole that moved us so far from home continues to have an effect, randomly throughout the game more wormholes appear just before a question is asked. If the player is in the lead and gets the question right they stay in the lead, otherwise they swap position with the losing player. Conversely if the player is losing and gets the question right swap position with the leading player while if they get the question wrong they stay where they are.</p>\n<p>The game ends when a player returns to Earth or when all questions have been asked.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs</em> is a 2009 movie in which Flint Lockwood, scientist and hero, creates the <em>Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator</em> which causes the sky to rain food. Bad guys then take over the device and unleash chaos on the world.</p>\n<p>The UK DVD of this movie contains a game, <em>Flint's Food Fight</em>. In this game Flint takes to the skies in his flying car to disable the machine. After a cinematic introduction the player uses the DVD remote's direction buttons to avoid food items and the DVD's ENTER button to shoot attacking gummy bears. After the flying sequence the player must enter a code sequence to trigger the machine's destruction.<br>\nAn on-screen graphic tells the player which button to press and when.</p>\n<p>The game is replayable because the attacking food items seem to appear randomly making the first part of the game different each time.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Trivial Pursuit DVD</em> is a family quiz game for 2-4 players/teams (up to 24 players if teams are used), implemented as a hybrid between the classical board game and a DVD player game.</p>\n<p>The game comes in a large oblong box that contains a fold-out game board, one die, one DVD in a sleeve, 30 coloured scoring wedges and four plastic character tokens.</p>\n<p>The game has questions in the usual six quiz areas: TV, Trends, Celebrities, Music, Movies, Sport&amp;Leisure, of which 1800 are found on 300 paper cards, and 150 are on the DVD. A player throws the dice to advance in one direction per throw on the outside of game board, and takes a card with a text question in the color (each color represents a quiz area) the token end up on.</p>\n<p>A correct answer lets the player continue rolling dice and move on the board, but a false answer gives the turn to the next player.</p>\n<p>If the token stops on a DVD/wedge symbol (which colour is not already placed in the token), the question is to be found on the DVD - the quiz areas are the same, though questions on the DVD use the multimedia features of sound and images - you get audio clips &amp; video clips to identify, multi-image matching/exclusion, distorted images to recognize and headlines to guess the relevant year for.</p>\n<p>A competing player may challenge the current player, if they think the answer given to a DVD question was wrong - except for the distorted image questions. Answering correct, gives the player a wedge item to place in his token.</p>\n<p>The game continues until a player has filled the token with all six coloured wedges, after which the players goal is to arrive exactly at the center of the game board, where a last DVD question is selected from any quiz area, which if correctly answered, makes this player the winner. If wrong, the game continues as before until one player has won.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Tiger Woods PGA Tour</em> is an interactive DVD game for one to four players.</p>\n<p>This game comes in a tin box with rounded corners measuring 26.5 cm x 18cm x 5.5 cm. Inside the box are two DVDs, one for the St Andrews course and one for the TPC Sawgrass course, each in a windowed paper envelope together with a large foldout map showing one course on each side.</p>\n<p>The game starts when the DVD is loaded and the game cycles through the licenses, title screen, welcome guide before arriving at the main menu. By default it plays 'How to play the game' instructions but these can be skipped, the main piece of information is that the game is played with just the direction arrows and the ENTER key. </p>\n<p>Playing the game starts with the player selection screen where there are four players to choose from Tiger Woods, Colin Montgomery, Jim Furyk and John Daly - helpfully they are all wearing different coloured shirts. Each human player takes turns selecting an on-screen golfer and then choosing between the Amateur/Pro game, so it is possible for player one to use Colin Montgomery on the Pro difficulty setting while player two uses Tiger Woods on the Amateur setting. Naturally both players play the same course but on the Pro setting the wind direction and club selection have more of an impact.</p>\n<p>Playing the game is quite straightforward. There is a fly-by of each hole together with a brief summary following this the golfer takes their place at the tee. Taking a shot is a three step process;* Step 1: Club selection. In the lower right of the screen are three clubs to choose from, the player uses the right /left direction keys to cycle between them and the ENTER button to select</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Step 2: Direction. In front of the player there is a semi-circle of eleven direction markers with the central marker highlighted. In the upper left is an arrow showing the direction and strength of the wind, the player uses the left/right arrow keys on their remote to make an appropriate adjustment to the direction of the shot and ENTER to select it</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Step 3: Taking the shot. Once the first two steps have been completed the view shifts to show the golfer side-on and a circular power meter with a rising power bar appears in the upper right. The player uses the ENTER button on the remote to stop the power bar at an appropriate point depending on the distance to the pin.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The same process is repeated for all shots apart from putting on the green when there is no choice of club because the putter is the only choice. The game keeps score throughout the match and it has a faux TV commentary.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Trivial Pursuit: Let Loose</em> is a DVD version of the popular board game for up to four players/teams. In the DVD case there are, or should be one DVD and a packet containing four score wheels each in a different colour; twenty-four category wedges, that's four for each category, four 'Colour Flip' cards, four 'I Choose' cards; and Eight 'Double Trouble' cards. The game does come with instructions which are printed on the reverse of the keep case inlay.</p>\n<p>After a funky video montage introduction the main menu appears with a choice of eight different quizzes and a 'Quick Start' option which explains how the game is played. This implementation of the game does not use a board but players still have their own scoring wheels onto which they slot a category wedge when they answer a question correctly - however these are 2D card and not the familiar 3D plastic versions. At the start of the game the cards are dealt out, one 'I Choose', one 'Colour flip' and two 'Double Trouble' cards each.</p>\n<p>There are six question categories, Girls, Boys, Adrenalin, Gross, Music and Unbelievable which can have questions featuring video and audio clips. Before each question the host pops up and says something humorous. There are two other categories:* A 'Dare' category which is used when one player/team challenges another, this contains mini-games such as \"Which stall in the toilets is the cleanest? - players click on one of three doors to reveal the answer; \"Find the cat in the dustbin\" - a variant on the old shell game and so-on.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Going For The Win. The DVD does NOT keep score, that is left to the players putting card wedges into their score-wheel. When a participant has correctly answered a a question from each category they face one final question - this is the one that wins the game.</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p><em>Host Your Own Race Night (4th Edition)</em> is the fourth in a series of DVD games featuring live video from UK race courses. Game packs such as this can be used for a family get together or for a charity fundraising event.</p>\n<p>The game comes in a box measuring 27.5cm x 27.5cm x 7cm and weighing around 730g. Inside is a DVD case containing a detailed manual / race guide and the DVD itself which holds sixteen races, some over hurdles but mainly on the flat. Also in the box is * a Bookies Ledger. This is a double sided record of the bets placed in each race, when the winnings have been paid the ledger is wiped clean and re-used. No cloth is provided for this.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>a marker pen - non permanent</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Betting cards. Needed so the players also have a record of the bets they made, these are also double sided and are wiped clean before the next race</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Game money. Lots of it</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's not a great deal of interactivity in this game. The players view the race details and, optionally, the detailed form guide for each horse before placing their bets. Bets are made on betting cards which the nominated, trustworthy, fiscally responsible, bookmaker records on their ledger as they take the player's cash. Players can bet on a horse to win, place 1st or 2nd, or place in the first three.</p>\n<p>At the end of the race the game shows the first three horses and the payouts for a player who placed a \u00a3100 on each of the three possible bets. As players can bet as much, or as little, as they want the bookmaker then has to scale the amount shown on screen up, or down, as appropriate and pay the players.</p>\n<p>There are sixteen races on the DVD, each race is between two and four minutes long but the manual advises allowing thirty minutes per race so that players can study the form guide and place their bets. A 'game' would typically be eight races meaning this could be played on two occasions but in practice players could decide to play one, any or all the races in a session. <br>\nThe player holding the most money when the game ends is the winner.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Now That's What I Call A Music Quiz</em> is a collection of three games based on pop music from the 1960's through to the 2000's. All games are played by one to four teams or players and there is a tutorial section for each voiced by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Mark+Goodier\">Mark Goodier</a> though he does not appear on screen at any point. The games available are:* Top 40: This is a game for one to four players or teams and the objective is to travel up a ladder from the fortieth place to the number one slot. Players do this by answering questions which are classed as easy, medium or hard and, if the player answers correctly, they move up the ranking by one, two or three positions respectively.</p>\n<p>Most questions are individual questions, i.e. Only the current player or team can answer but some questions allow anyone to shout out the answer. If the question is answered by the current team then they advance as normal but if an opposing player/team answers then the current team stays put.</p>\n<p>Some positions on the ladder are coloured red, these are the Hit or Miss squares. If a player tries to land on such a position, for example if they are two positions away and ask for a medium difficulty question, then if they get their question right they are allowed to move extra positions up the ladder however if they get te question wrong they have to move back down the ladder.  </p>\n<p>The first player/team to reach number one must answer a random difficulty question in order to win</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Top 20: As with the Top 40 game this can be played by up to four players or teams and it also features a ladder that runs from twenty to one. However in this game the player in control answers questions that become increasingly more difficult. The player continues answering questions until they either stick in which case they retain their position on the ladder, or until they get one wrong in which case they return to their starting position.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I Spy: In this game the player's select a decade from the 1960's &amp; 1970's, 1980's, 1990's, 0r 2000's. The game then begins.   </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are five rounds and in each round a picture of a celebrity from the chosen decade is hidden behind a 3x3 grid of tiles. The current player retains control until they get a question wrong but for each correct answer a tile is removed and part of the underlying image is revealed. Any player or team can shout out the identity of the celebrity at any time, if they are right they get a point, if they are wrong they lose a point. The winner is the player or team with the most points after all five rounds have been completed.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Fingers on Buzzers</em> is an interactive DVD game for two to four players. What makes this game different to many others is the inclusion of four individual buzzers with five buttons. These are connected by wire to an infra-red device which 'talks' to the DVD player telling it which player pushed which button.</p>\n<p>There are two games to be played here, the short game which consists of five rounds each with six questions and the long game which has seven rounds each with eight questions. Players score one thousand points for each correct answer with the points going to the player who presses their buzzer the fastest. Guessing is to be avoided as players can lose a thousand points for an incorrect answer. At some point during the game, provided players are not tied on the same score, the game will play a 'Shake 'em Up' round where scores can be swapped or points can be stolen.</p>\n<p>Scores are announced at the end of the round and if there is a tie at the end of the game. </p>\n<p>The rounds vary considerably in content from basic spelling and mental arithmetic, a whack-a-mole like round where the player has to press the appropriate coloured button when a specific picture appears, identifying objects in pixelated images or a person from a sound clip. All questions and instructions are fully voiced throughout the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Trivial Pursuit DVD Game: Star Wars Saga Edition</em> is an interactive DVD game. This game is a two player version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/p,3/gameId,97561\">Trivial Pursuit DVD: Star Wars Saga Edition</a> which comes with a full Trivial Pursuit board etc and is for more players. This game comes in a black keep case sized box with predominantly silver writing that is enclosed in a card sleeve. The box is four cm deep and opens like a chest, a plastic DVD mount has been glued to the inside of the lid while in the base are recesses for the two dice and the stack of question cards. </p>\n<p>There are many similarities between the two games, both games come with two DVDs containing twenty pre-planned quizzes and the question cards look identical apart from the colouring of the game's name. The question categories are also identical, being:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blue - The Cantina: these questions are about specific scenes, cameo roles and alien races.</li>\n<li>Pink - The Force: this features scenes in which the Force is used or referred to.</li>\n<li>Yellow - Heroes, Villains &amp; Scoundrels: the title says it all.</li>\n<li>Brown - The Saga: these questions are about the movie plots, sub plots and story arcs.</li>\n<li>Green - A Galaxy Far Away: a category devoted to the towns, cities, planets and galaxies of the Star Wars universe - at least the movie versions.</li>\n<li>Orange - Wildcard: a sort of miscellaneous group</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Without having both games available for direct comparison it is not possible to say whether the games use exactly the same questions, however given that both games have the same title and menu screens plus the credits of this game are dated 2005 it does seem probable that this game is a reworking of the big box game.</p>\n<p>Gameplay here differs from the big box version of the game in two ways. The first difference is that there are two dice for the player to roll, one die determines whether the player answers a DVD question or a card question while the second determines the question category. The second difference is the scoring system because instead of moving tokens around a board the game has been adapted to use a scorecard system. Both players have a card showing a scoring grid and a cover card that, well, covers it. As questions are answered the cover card is moved to reveal a column on the score card. There are three levels of difficulty to the game so after revealing six, nine or twelve columns the player can attempt the 'For The Win' final question.</p>",

Though the title bears a striking similarity to the television show <em>Strictly Come Dancing</em> this title has next to nothing about dancing in it apart from the section headings and a plethora of dance related puns and facts. </p>\n<p>There are thirty six quizzes of multiple choice questions in this title and each can be played as a single player or two player game. The quizzes are grouped into nine 'dunce halls' that are Ballroom; Folk; Latin; Erotic; War; Swing; Scottish; Street and Novelty. Within each 'dunce hall' there are four quizzes in which introductions, questions and answers are all read by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/112741/stephen-fry/\">Stephen Fry</a>. All scoring is done within the game so there is no need for a pencil and paper.   </p>\n<p>In single player mode the player's opponent is <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Alan+Davies\">Alan Davies</a> a regular on the Q.I television show. Alan can be seen in a small side window playing the game and trying to answer the questions after the player has made their choice. At the end of a round <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/112741/stephen-fry/\">Stephen Fry</a> announces whether the player has beaten <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Alan+Davies\">Alan</a> or not.  </p>\n<p>In two player mode <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Alan+Davies\">Alan Davies</a> is nowhere to be seen, instead <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/112741/stephen-fry/\">Stephen Fry</a> reads the question and the possible answers and each player selects what they think is the correct answer. At the end of the round <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/112741/stephen-fry/\">Stephen Fry</a> announces whether Player A or Player B wins.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Vem vill bli miljon\u00e4r</em> is the first interactive DVD game in the 'Who wants to be a millionaire' franchise.</p>\n<p>The DVD version shares the cover graphics of the first PC/console game versions, but differs a bit in the gameplay; e.g. there is no highscore kept since a DVD player cannot save results from earlier sessions, but instead there are more video clips to enhance the game experience. The game starts with the selection of the number of players; 1-4, and a short intro video showing the audience sitting around the central empty seat.</p>\n<p>This version does not have a visible game host, but video clips of a live audience are used when it is called upon to suggest an answer to a question, and there are also image/sound clips in the 'call a friend' choices - when calling a friend, the player is given a choice of three people with different knowledge and background listed, which can affect the likelyhood of a correct suggestion. There is no time limit that requires an answer before it runs out.</p>\n<p>There are two safety levels at 10.000 and 100.000, and 15 questions to the maximum sum of 3 Million (virtual) SEK.\nThree lifelines are available per game: 50:50, 'ask the audience' and 'ask a friend'. If a player manages to answer all questions correctly and win the virtual millions, they are shown a code that lets them participate in a real competition via a one-time mail-in coupon for a vacation trip for four persons to Spain, visiting the Universal Studios Mediterranea resort. This coupon was only available in the DVD release of the game, and the competition ended in mid 2005.</p>\n<p>Once the gameplay is finished by winning or losing, the game starts a new session, asking for the number of players again.</p>",

At its heart this title consists of around twenty seven minutes of short extracts from the music of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/117930/wolfgang-amadeus-mozart/\">Mozart</a>.</p>\n<p>The options available in this game are:* Theatre: here the full twenty seven minutes of music can be played through in its entirety either once or put onto a continuous loop. Each piece of music is accompanied by bright images and videos, usually featuring toys or puppets, designed to attract a toddler's attention.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Concert Hall: this plays selections of music from the main list grouped into Mozart For Little Ears; Mozart For Bedtime; and Mozart For Playtime. As with the previous option the music can be played through once or put on a continuous loop however in the Concert Hall there are no accompanying video clips.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Language Lab: here there are flash cards in nine languages; English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Hebrew, Japanese, Russian, and Mandarin. Once a language has been selected the players have four options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vocabulary mode where the players step through the cards naming them.</li>\n<li>Reading mode where the card is displayed together with the word in the appropriate language both written beneath it and spoken.</li>\n<li>Vocabulary Auto-Play</li>\n<li>Reading Auto-Play<br>\nAll of the flash cards feature nice bright pictures most of which are of toys and occasionally fruit.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Resources: this option consists of a Video Tutorial which is a promo video for the Baby Einstein range of products, and Toy Chest which lists the video clips that accompany the music in the Theatre section.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p><em>Smash Hits!: Ultimate Pop Quiz</em> is a DVD game for one to four players. The format of the game is loosely based on an awards ceremony with players receiving awards. The single player consists of twenty questions, worth one or two points, and is over either when all questions have been asked or when twenty points have been scored. The multiplayer game ends when twenty points have been scored. The game is fully voiced at 'menu level' - in other words it uses standard phrases such as 'Your turn player one', 'Choose a question type from the following options', 'You've chosen Love Songs - How romantic' and suchlike but all the questions are text that must be read. </p>\n<p>In the quiz players answer a series of multiple choice questions using their DVD remote control to choose one of the available answers. <br>\nThere are eight question categories - Pop Groups; Solo Artists; Love Songs; Rap &amp; R 'n B; Dub &amp; Dance; Rock &amp; Indie; One Hit Wonders; and Retro however in each turn the player is only offered a choice of three. Within each category there are five types of question - Videostar: watch a video lip and answer a question; Jukebox: listen to a snatch of a song and answer a question; Photocall; here the question is based on a photograph; Pod Selecta: where the questions are based on song titles and are timed; and Take Two: which is based on duos.</p>\n<p>No pen and pencil is required for this game as it automatically keeps the score.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The X Factor: Interactive TV Game</em> is a game for one to four players/teams. It is based on the UK TV series <em>The X Factor</em>, features clips from the first four series, and is hosted by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/1184131/fearne-cotton/\">Fearne Cotton</a> who hosted the spin-off TV series <em>The Xtra Factor</em> in 2007.</p>\n<p>The game is based on the TV Show's format. I has four rounds. Each round starts with a short introduction from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/1184131/fearne-cotton/\">Fearne Cotton</a> who also presents each round's help section. Points earned in rounds one, two and three may earn lifelines in the final round. The rounds are:  </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Auditions: These represent the TV show's regional auditions in which the player(s) judge three acts based on clips from the show. Two points are earned if the player's assessment matches the judges.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Boot Camp: This round asks the player(s) three questions based on music knowledge and X Factor trivia. At the start of the round each player is assigned one of the following question categories Groups; 14-24 year old girls; 14-24 year old boys; 25 year old and over. Questions generally show a clip of a song being sung by X Factor contestants and the player is asked a related question such as \"Who was the original artist?\"; \"Name the song?\" and so on. If the question is answered correctly the player is asked a bonus question such as \"Name the best selling group of all time?\"; \"Which city did the 2003 finalist X come from?\"; \"Name the first UK hit single/album by <em>XXXX</em>?\". All questions are multiple choice with three possible answers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Judges' Homes: This is a timed round of three questions each worth five points. Despite the title the questions are about X Factor presenters and contestants not the places they live. Questions include pixelated pictures of presenters and acts that slowly become clearer; clips of acts from the TV show that have to be named; and presenter related questions such as which acts that they managed etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Live Shows. This is the main round of the game. The player(s) are asked five questions each and can choose from Easy, Medium and Hard categories. The categories are worth one, two and three weeks (points) respectively which represents the ten week road to the TV Final.   </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If the question is answered correctly the player proceeds to the next question.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the question is answered incorrectly the game shows a random clip of an X Factor contestant's performance. If that performance was good enough for the contestant to survive in the TV contest then the player can continue in the game otherwise it's 'Game Over', these are the lifelines earned in the previous rounds.  </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The objective is to score ten weeks and enter the Grand Final in which the player is asked one final question to win the game.</p>\n<p>Players successfully answering the final question beat the game and also unlock a secret code. Entry to the competition is by text only, there was one Grand Prize comprising - backstage passes for The X Factor Live Tour of 2008, an exclusive disc, a 40\" LCD TV, a home cinema sound system, a Playstation 3, a DVD player, a laptop and an mp3 player.</p>",

Argonia is invaded by a horde known as the Sirroms, and the planet's Guardian Force has to find a way to save it. In a last-ditch effort to save the planet, the Guardian opens a rift between Argonia and our Earth, and selects four warriors from Earth's timeline, who have an inert DNA strand that marks them as potential saviours of Argonia. Manipulating the DNA of these four ordinary people, the Guardian is able to bring these planet-saving abilities to the surface, and turns them into the eponymous Advanced Warriors. You decide what path the warriors take, and make critical decisions for them.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Richard Hammond's Top Gear Stunt Challenge</em> is a one or two player game, or as the game puts it 'Billy No Mates' and 'Head to Head', and it is a series of silly mini games with lots of video clips rather than the usual DVD quiz. The game invites players to select a team from Team Hammond; Team May; Team Clarkson and Team Stig and then the games begin. The game keeps score and everything is explained by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Richard+Hammond\">Richard Hammond</a>, the challenges are;* The Let's Not Blow Up Richard Hammond game: There are five white vans lined up on the Top Gear runway. Richard hides in one of them and one team attempts to blow up the empty vans. In preparation for this round the teams bid for how many empty vans they think they can blow up, the team that loses out in the bidding secretly selects the van Richard will be in.  </p>\n<p>Points are awarded for selecting the chosen number of empty vans and not blowing up Richard, points are lost if Richard is toasted.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Crock And Roll: 30 Years Of Top Gear. Here Richard shows a TV clip from an old Top Gear episode and the team/player has a limited time in which to guess the year. If they fail to answer within the time limit additional clues are given but the number of points is reduced. Teams answer questions alternately.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dashboard Reference: This is a spot the difference round where teams take turns to answer. A dashboard is shown for a short time, fifteen seconds or thereabouts, and then there is an interval where Richard does something like driving an off-road car in a race with a motor bike - a clever distraction to wipe the image of the dashboard from the players' minds, after which the dashboard is shown once again but something subtle will have changed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Skittle Powersliding: The Stig powerslides one of fifteen cars round a corner and attempts to knock over man-sized skittles in the process. Teams are shown some basic statistics about the car being used and guess how many skittles will be knocked over.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bunch Of Stunts: This is a multiple choice quiz round where the questions are based on Top Gear stunts. <br>\nFor example Top Gear once featured a race between a Bugatti Veron and a Eurofighter, the question asked is \"<em>The Bugatti's top speed is 252mph. What is the Eurofighter's?</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Carabungee: This starts with a caravan suspended from a crane by bungee rope(s). When dropped the caravan falls to earth but stops well before it hits the earth. Teams take turns to add domestic objects ranging from a safe to a microwave in an attempt to get the caravan to fall further without hitting the ground.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Golden Anorak: This is billed as the quiz bit for geeks, teams take turns to answer ten questions. Example questions are;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This car weighs xxxx kg, does this car weigh more or less?</li>\n<li>As above but substitute cost for weight</li>\n<li>Where is this car built?</li>\n<li>In which film does the featured car stunt appear?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p><em>Final Answer : Norwich City</em> is one of a series of interactive DVD quizzes each featuring a different football club.</p>\n<p>This quiz differs from most DVD quizzes as it does not use the usual format of a series of rounds, instead if a player answers a question correctly they retain 'possession' and get to answer another and another. For each correctly answered question a short animation shows the player's football team advancing towards the opposing goal until they eventually score by answering a question correctly, or if they answer incorrectly there's a save, either way possession changes to the other team and the game continues.</p>\n<p>All questions are multiple choice and the whole game is timed. In the event of a tie at full-time there's a penalty shoot-out round.</p>",

There are twelve games on the DVD, six multiplayer games and six single player games, in each case the objective is the same and that is to score as many points as possible over seven newspaper themed rounds.  </p>\n<p>Scoring is done manually with a pen and a piece of paper and a score sheet is available on the DVD in .pdf format. Teams must select a name and an icon before the game begins as throughout the quiz the icon will be used to indicate bonus questions some of which could score double points for a correct answer while others can lose the team points for an incorrect answer.</p>\n<p>All players/teams see the same questions on screen and record their answers on separate score sheets, the format of the rounds is as follows:* Round 1: Time Trivia. Following a video clip the players may be asked \"Who was the next American president?\", or \"This took place in xxxxxx, on what sea does xxxxxx lie?\" as well as the usual \"What year was this?\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Round 2: Blast From The Past. The players are shown a fragmented picture and must identify the person portrayed, just three questions in this round.</li>\n<li>Round 3: Multiple Choice. Twelve quick questions each with four possible answers.</li>\n<li>Round 4: Who Said What?. This round has two audio clips and the players have to identify the speaker</li>\n<li>Round 5: The Order Of Time. Two questions in which the teams are shown four pictures and must put them in the correct order.</li>\n<li>Round 6: Question Time. Twelve quick questions ranging from subjects as diverse as US politics, UK music, computer games and technology, television and fashion since the 1960's.</li>\n<li>Round 7: Read All About It. Players are shown the front page of a newspaper and must answer question on it</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After each round players are given the opportunity to replay it or continue.  </p>\n<p>All questions are spoken as well as appearing as on-screen text  </p>\n<p>If the scores are tied at the end of a game a single tie-break question is asked. The first person/team to answer correctly wins, if neither side answers correctly then the side whose answer is closest wins.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Price Is Right</em> is a television show that started in America in the mid 1950's and since then the game has been remade in over forty countries. This game is based on the UK show and is presented by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/24671/joe-pasquale/\">Joe Pasquale</a> who hosted the show in 2006/7.  </p>\n<p>There are two modes of depending on the number of players, there is no single player option;* 3 or 4 Players: This plays just like the television show.\n    + Round 1: The Pricing Round. Players are shown an object and must guess it's price from a range of options without 'going over'. All players choose from the same selection of prices so going first is an advantage.<br>\n    The winner of the first round then has a chance at a 'Super Game' where they can win an additional prize before going on to the grand final. This process is repeated until only one player is left - that player has lost.  </p>\n<pre><code>Super games are mini games played for an additional prize, typically players are asked to select the highest/lowest items or the items that have the same price from a selection.\n\n+ Round 2: The Big Wheel Round: The 'Big Wheel' has segments with values up to 100. The remaining players spin th wheel to get the highest score without exceeding 100. The winning player gets to play the Showcase Final.\n\n+ Round Three: The Showcase Final. Before playing the final round the remaining contestant plays a simple mini game to find out how accurate their final bid must be. With that decided the player is then shown a range of items from garden features to motorbikes, from holidays to furniture and guesses the combined value selecting a price from the options offered without 'going over'. If successful they win the game, either way it's Game Over and the credits roll.\n\nIn the Pricing Round and in its Super Games players are shown a computer generated representation of the item to be priced but in the Showcase Final they are shown a filmed sequence with models and the real thing.\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Joe's Two Player Challenge: a player must win thee pricing games in order to progress to the big wheel round. If the player wins the Big Wheel round they are straight through to the Showcase Final, if they lose then they must win another pricing game before they can try again.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the inside cover is a text-in competition for a cash prize.</p>",

The game has been simplified a bit for the DVD format which allows limited interactivity.

DVD 1 is Peter Alliss's Legend's Of Golf while DVD 2 holds <em>'Peter Alliss's Golf Quiz'</em> and some video clips of Peter answering some interview questions. Peter is also on hand to introduce and explain the game, to introduce each round, pass comment in the players' score at the end of the round and to deliver the 'Final Analysis' when the game ends.</p>\n<p>The quiz can be played by one or two players and it has two modes of play, the short nine hole game or the long eighteen hole game, whichever mode is selected the quiz will always have just five rounds with the long game just having twice as many questions. Players take turns to answer questions and at the end of the round the game shows both the round and the cumulative scores for each player so there's no need for a pencil &amp; paper with this game. </p>\n<p>Two rounds have multiple choice questions; in one round players must identify a golfer from a blurred picture which is slowly revealed; in another they must rank four things in order for example who has won the most US open titles; and then there's the 'What Happened Next?' round where the game pauses a video clip partway through and the player has to state the what happened next. Once the answer has been given the player(s) resume the quiz and state whether the answer given was correct or not.</p>\n<p>In golf the players attempt to get round the course using as few strokes as possible which means that the winner is the player with the lowest score, so it is in this game as a correct answer scores minus one point again meaning that the winner is the player with the lowest score. There is a tie-break round should the scores be equal at the end of the five rounds.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This is a two DVD set of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/1005989/ross-noble/\">Ross Noble</a>'s UK Unrealtime tour of 2003. The first disc contains the Unrealtime show performed at London's Garrick theatre, while the second disc contains a live performance from Regent's Park, London.</p>\n<p>Among the DVD extras on the Unrealtime disc is a twenty question trivia quiz, which, if all questions are answered correctly, unlocks some \"<i>never before seen archive footage</i>.\" However, the trivia knowledge needed to answer the questions in the quiz is not based on Ross' performance. There is another DVD extra option, which, when turned on, causes a series of trivia facts to be displayed as subtitles while the performance is being watched. All the questions are multiple choice with three possible answers.  The trivia upon which the quiz is based is humorous. For example: \"<i>The vole is the only mammal with four legs happy to wear a jacket</i>,\" which means that logic, rational thought and a good general education are of little use in trying to answer this quiz.\nThe DVDs come in a keep case-sized box made of cardboard. Inside the box are plastic mounts for the DVDs and an eight-panel foldout poster which has the Unrealtime cover art on one side and tour/marketing material on the other.</p>",

In the single player game the player is asked a series of twenty random questions after which they are given their score.</p>\n<p>The multiplayer game is played over eight rounds where each round represents a week in the house with the winner being the player with the most votes (aka points). While playing this game the players choose a housemate as an avatar and are referred to my the housemate's name and not their own. After each round the game reveals which player has the most votes.<br>\nIn  Weeks One, Two and Three each housemate is asked three random questions themed as a variety of different tasks;<br>\n- Big Brother's Trivia: A simple multiple choice question <br>\n- Diary Room Demons: Here players listen to a clip and guess who is speaking <br>\n- Headline Grabbers: A Big Brother related newspaper page is shown with a word of the headline blacked out and platers must guess the missing word <br>\n- Catchphrase: Some housemates had a catchphrase but who had what?<br>\n- Missing Housemates: A picture of housemates is shown where one 'mate has been hidden by pixellation, who is it?<br></p>\n<p>In Week Four each player has to answer three quick-fire questions, only five second per question to answer. The questions can be from one of two categories;<br>\n- Matching Pairs: Pictures of two housemates are shown and the player has to answer Yes if they were in the Big Brother house at the same time, otherwise they answer No<br>\n- Name The Housemate: After seeing a housemate's picture the player must identify them correctly.<br></p>\n<p>In Week Five watch player's watch a clip and decide what happens next. <br>\nWeek Six is called Rucks and Rows, players watch two video clips each and decide what the argument was about in each clip.<br>\nWeek Seven is the Name The Year round, this is the only round where there are clues available but using a clue means a reduced score for a correct answer.<br>\nThe final week is Week Eight, The Eviction. The players are shown a full set of housemates from a series and take turns to place them into the order they were evicted, an incorrect answer costs one hundred votes.</p>\n<p>After Week Eight players are evicted in ascending order which means the last remaining player has the highest score and the the winner.</p>\n<p>All questions are multiple choice and are spoken by an announcer who never appears on screen.

        "description": "<p><i>Telly Addicts: Multi-Player Family Edition</i> is a family game based on the UK TV show 'Telly Addicts'. It is a quiz about television shows for one or two players/teams and there is an option to select whether each team is playing as an adult or as a child.</p>\n<p>The game is played over seven rounds and during the game each team will receive a bonus question, there's no need for pen and paper to keep score as the game does this automatically and shows the score at the end of each  round.</p>\n<p>Round One: Screen Test. In this round there are six TV screens shown and behind each is a picture or a video clip and a related question. Players take it in turns to select a screen and answer a question, they get one point for each correct answer.</p>\n<p>Round Two: TV Ties. This time each player gets just one set of themed questions. The first question is a picture question showing characters from a show and the player must name the character that is missing. Following this are two related questions, each correct answer scores one  point giving a maximum of three points for the round.</p>\n<p>Round Three: Classic Clips. Again there's just one set of questions per player with each correct answer scoring one point giving a maximum of three points for the round. After watching a TV clip the players are asked related questions, one is observational, one is about the show and one is about the character.</p>\n<p>Round Four: Odd One Out. Slightly different format to this round but still up to three points at stake. Players are shown pictures of four characters from a show, say Del Boy; Rodney; Uncle Albert and Trigger from 'Only Fools and Horses', and they are given a clue to identify the odd one out. If the player answers correctly straight away they score three points, if they answer incorrectly they score zero. However there are two additional clues on offer. Taking each clue reduces the number of points scored for a correct answer by one point.</p>\n<p>Round Five: Theme Tunes. Simply identify a theme tune from a sound clip.</p>\n<p>Round Six: Guess The Show. Guess The Show. Identify the TV show from the clues given by members of the public. As with Round Four there are additional clues available but they reduce the number of points for a correct answer</p>\n<p>Round Seven: Spotlight. Each player is asked three questions in succession and is given only ten seconds to answer each one.</p>\n<p>At the end of the game Noel announces the winner. If there is a tie then the game will ask a tiebreaker question.</p>",

        "description": "<p><i>Raven</i> is a DVD game based on BBC Scotland's TV show which ran from 2002 to 2010 in the UK and which was later revived for a short run in 2017 to 2018.</p>\n<p>The original TV show was hosted by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=James+Mackenzie\">James Mackenzie</a> who presents this DVD. In the show a group of children faced a series of tasks to become 'The Ultimate Warrior' and the game follows a similar format.</p>\n<p>The game can be played as a single player game or as a multiplayer game for two, three or four players. In the multi player game each player is asked two questions to determine their spirit character whereas in the single player game the player simply chooses between the two characters offered.<br>\nOnce the characters have been chosen the next step is to choose a route. There are three routes to choose from;<br>\n- The Path Of The Demon: Four levels. Difficulty level three   <br>\n- The Path Of The Wizard: Six levels. Difficulty level six  <br>\n- The Path Of Nevar: Eight levels. Difficulty level nine.</p>\n<p>Each path consists of a number of mini games and puzzles. Players start with a number of feathers which are effectively lives because when they are all lost the game is over. Players receive gold rings as a reward for successfully completing a task and seven of these rings can be used to buy back one feather, in some tasks there are additional rings that can be discovered and added to the player's total.</p>\n<p>In the multiplayer game the players arrive at a mini game and play it in turns but each game can be slightly different. For example in the mini game Burning Battlements player one completes their turn, then player two and so on whereas in the game Demon Square a question is asked and the players take turns to answer it, then the next question is asked until all questions have been asked.</p>\n<p>Some of the mini games are: <br>\n- Enchanted Stream: To win two gold rings the player must reassemble a broken bridge by clicking on a selection of pieces in the correct order.  <br>\n- Spider Tunnel: There the player has to navigate a maze, collect gold rings and avoid spiders.  <br>\n- Demon Causeway: The player and the demon move alternately and the objective is to cross a grid without being caught. The reward is one gold ring but there are other rings hidden under the tiles of the grid.  <br>\n- Riddle Bridge: After the magic book has read a riddle the player is presented with a bridge of letters, the task is to select the correct letters from each step of the bridge and get to the other side by completing the word that answers the riddle.  <br>\n- Demon Square: The Wisdom Tree asks a series of questions to which the answers are either True or False. For each correct answer the player advances one square. Two incorrect answers ends the game  <br>\n- Serpent's Eye: This is a shooting game where the player has  three attempts to hit a target  <br>\n- Burning Battlements: The player uses a siege catapult to douse three fires with water bombs  <br>\n- Dwarf Mine: This is a memory game. The player is shown four symbols before they enter the mine. These symbols are on props which must be removed in order to go deeper in the mine, removing the wrong props will cause the roof to collapse.  &gt;br&gt;\n- Way of the Warrior: This is the final game where  the player has to navigate a path and avoid traps. There are three stages to complete and if successful the player will enter the portal to the Last Stand.</p>",

        "description": "<p><i>Play Your Cards Right</i> was a popular UK TV show that ran from 1980 to 1987. It has since been revived twice, first in 1994 when it ran until1999 and once more from 2002 to 2003.</p>\n<p>This game has both single player and two formats, in the single player game the player plays against the DVD. <br>\nTo start the multiplayer game one player must gain control of the game. This is done by asking a question of the form \"<i>We asked 100 fishermen if they ever lied about the size of their catch</i>\". Player one has to guess what percentage said 'Yes\" and player two then says whether they think the true answer is higher or lower than that figure. The winner of that mini game then takes control of the main board.</p>\n<p>The main board uses playing cards and the player in control guesses whether the next card to be revealed will be higher or lower than the last card shown.  They continue guessing until they make a mistake, in which case the other player takes control, or they cannot be sure of the answer in which case there is another question round.</p>\n<p>After three rounds of the game both players proceed to the final round. This is played just the same as the previous rounds however both players have a cash stake which they can gamble on the turn of the cards. The winner is the player with the most cash at the end of the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=John+McCririck\">John McCririck</a> was a sports journalist before becoming a UK television racing pundit. On this DVD he presents fifty minutes of falling horses, falling jockeys and other mainly horse racing related entertainment. During the course of the DVD he makes reference to Tic Tac, the system of hand gestures bookmakers use is called and even demonstrates a few moves at the end.</p>\n<p>In the DVD Extras section there is a Tic Tac game which is in two parts, in the first part Jihn again demonstrates the Tic Tac moves while the second part is a ten question, single player, quiz. \nIn each question John demonstrates a move and the player has to answer a multiple choice question to say what the move was, John then repeats the gesture this time giving the answer. At the end of the quiz the game gives the player's score</p>",

        "description": "<p>Play Your Cards Right was a popular UK TV show that ran from 1980 to 1987. Though this game's tag-line says 'All New' the instructions are practically identical to the earlier 2006 DVD game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Play+Your+Cards+Right\">Play Your Cards Right</a> meaning the gameplay is the same but the questions asked of the general public will be different..</p>\n<p>This game has both single player and two formats, in the single player game the player plays against the DVD.<br>\nTo start the multiplayer game one player must gain control of the game. This is done by asking a question of the form \"We asked 100 fishermen if they ever lied about the size of their catch\". Player one has to guess what percentage said 'Yes\" and player two then says whether they think the true answer is higher or lower than that figure. The winner of that mini game then takes control of the main board.</p>\n<p>The main board uses playing cards with one card showing face up and the player in control guesses whether the next card to be revealed will be higher or lower than it. They continue guessing until they make a mistake, in which case the other player takes control, or they cannot be sure of the answer in which case there is another question round.</p>\n<p>After three rounds of the game both players proceed to the final round. This is played just the same as the previous rounds however both players have a cash stake which they can gamble on the turn of the cards. The winner is the player with the most cash at the end of the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><i>John Francome's Day At The Races</i> is a family DVD game based on betting on the outcome of pre-recorded real horse races it is very similar to <a href=\"/game/97553/john-francomes-night-at-the-dogs/\">John Francome's Night At The Dogs</a></p>\n<p>The game comes in a box which contains a DVD in a keep case; \u00a380,000 of 'fun money' money in four denominations, a pad of betting slips; four pencils; a wipe-clean bookmaker's slate and a wipe-clean pen; and a manual. The DVD contains sixteen races all filmed at UK race courses.</p>\n<p>At the start of the game players nominate the most capable of their number as the bookie, this person accepts bets, hands out winnings and has the final word in any dispute. Players are given \u00a36,000 in game money to bet with, they then load the DVD and watch John Francome introduce the game and optionally explain it in detail for those who have not played it before.</p>\n<p>When a race is selected from the race menu the DVD shows a race sheet with the names of the runners, their odds and their form or previous race history over which John Francome's voice can be heard giving his tips for the upcoming race. The nominated bookie writes the names and the odds on the bookmaker's slate and takes bets from the players.<br>\nPlayers are allowed two bets per race, the minimum bet is \u00a3100 and all bets are in multiples of \u00a3100 to keep the maths simple. There are eight runners in each race and just two types of bet are allowed, betting on a horse to win or an each-way bet where the punter bets that a horse will finish first, second or third. <br>\nWhen all bets have been made the DVD remote is used to press the on-screen 'Ready To Race' button and the film of the race is shown with full commentary and a replay of the last few seconds as the winner crosses the line. The game then announces the winners and, as an aid to the bookie, it states what the return of a successful \u00a3100 bet would be.</p>\n<p>Also on the DVD are; <br>\n-  Extra betting slips - there's a .pdf file on the DVD which can be printed when the betting slip pad is exhausted  <br>\n-  John Francome's Racing Funnies  - a selection of anecdotes  <br>\n-  A summary of racing terms</p>",

The TV show was presented by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Michael+Barrymore\">Michael Barrymore</a> who is on hand to host this game.</p>\n<p>In the show teams three teams of two players had to answer questions to move across the game board, one team member answers the questions while the other moves across their allotted row. The DVD game follows the same format as the television show, there are still three teams though each team can now have one or more players. Each team moves across their row and at each of the ten points along that row is a television screen which reveals either a prize or a hot spot when the player lands on it. <br>\nIf a prize is revealed the player can either bank the prize in which case their turn ends or they can make another move. <br>\nIf a Hot Spot is revealed then their turn ends and any unbanked prizes are lost.<br>\nThe first team to get all the way across the board enters the Jackpot Round. Now in the qualifying round each team had their own row each with ten stops but in this round the successful team uses all three rows. The aim is still the same, to cross the game board in ten moves but now the team could, for example, choose point one from the top row, point two from the bottom row, point three from the top row, point four from the middle and so on. Each hot spot encountered costs a life, cross the board to win but  when all lives are gone it is 'Game Over'.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This is a five round quiz about rugby for one or two teams/players. Players can choose between two types of game, the Half Season game and the Full Season game, both have five rounds but there are twice as many questions in the Full Season Game. At the end of the game the player with the highest score wins, in the event of a tie there is a sudden death round where the first player to make a mistake loses.</p>\n<p>During the game there may be 'pop-ups' which could be a bonus that doubles the points scored in a round or a penalty which loses one point for every incorrect answer in a round.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Round One:</strong> Following a short video clip there are two multiple choice questions</li>\n<li><strong>Round Two:</strong> A video clip is paused part way through and players must say what happened next. This is not a multiple choice question and there's nothing sophisticated here, the player literally says what they think happens next then continues the quiz where the correct answer is revealed. The game then asks 'Did you answer correctly?' and expects an honest answer.</li>\n<li><strong>Round Three:</strong> A speed round - players are shown a question and four images which must be ranked in the correct order.</li>\n<li><strong>Round Four:</strong> The 'Name The Player' round. A blurred picture is revealed one tile at a time, answering quickly scores more points. When the player thinks they have the answer the click on the on-screen 'Reveal' button and are told the answer at which point hey are again asked 'Did you answer correctly?'</li>\n<li><strong>Round Five:</strong> Three multiple choice questions to be answered against the clock.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The quiz is hosted by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/707945/john-inverdale/\">John Inverdale</a>, an ex-rugby player and veteran sports broadcaster, who introduces the quiz as a whole and explains each round. It was filmed at <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/707945/john-inverdale/\">John's</a> old club Esher Rugby Football Club and there's an interview with him in the DVD Extras section.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The <i>Interactive Football DVD Quiz Game</i> is a football quiz which comes in a card keep case inside a card sleeve. </p>\n<p>This is a five round football quiz for one or two teams/players. Players can choose between two types of game, the League Game and the Cup Game, both have five rounds but there are twice as many questions in the League Game. At the end of the game the player with the highest score wins, in the event of a tie there is a sudden death round where the first player to make a mistake loses.<br>\nDuring the game there may be 'pop-ups' which could be a bonus that doubles the points scored in a round or a penalty which loses one point for every incorrect answer in a round.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Round One:</strong> Following a short video clip there are two multiple choice questions.</li>\n<li><strong>Round Two:</strong> A video clip is paused part way through and players must say what happened next. This is not a multiple choice question and there's nothing sophisticated here, the player literally says what they think happens next then continues the quiz where the correct answer is revealed. The game then asks 'Did you answer correctly?' and expects an honest answer.</li>\n<li><strong>Round Three:</strong> A speed round - players are shown a question and four images which must be ranked in the correct order.</li>\n<li><strong>Round Four</strong>: The 'Name The Player' round. A blurred picture is revealed one tile at a time, answering quickly scores more points. When the player thinks they have the answer the click on the on-screen 'Reveal' button and are told the answer at which point hey are again asked 'Did you answer correctly?'</li>\n<li><strong>Round Five</strong>: Three multiple choice questions to be answered against the clock.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The quiz is hosted by <a href=\"/person/32276/jonathan-pearce/\">Jonathan Pearce</a>, a veteran sports broadcaster, who introduces the quiz as a whole and explains each round; there's an interview with him in the DVD Extras section.</p>",

The game is hosted by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/972157/graham-mcpherson/\">Suggs</a>, the lead singer of the band Madness, who were very big in the '80s. He not only introduces the game; he also reads all of the questions as well as the in-game instructions.</p>\n<p>There are three game formats available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Quick Game</strong> - the first to 25 points wins</li>\n<li><strong>The Short Game</strong> - played to 50 points</li>\n<li><strong>The Long Game</strong> - ends at 80 points</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All questions are timed and must be answered within 10 seconds. A standard question will score five points if answered correctly and within the allowed time but before playing a question, a team can opt to gamble.</p>\n<p>There are three kinds of gamble available; a correctly answered can either score more bonus points, or it can double the team's score (the downside being that if the question is not answered correctly the team's score is wiped out), or it can steal points from the other team.</p>\n<p>The types of question are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Which Year?</strong> Typically the team is shown a picture of an artist or a personality and then asked when did a particular event take place. The player picks a year from the four on offer.</li>\n<li><strong>Fact or Crap:</strong> A simple true/false question.</li>\n<li><strong>Missing Lyrics:</strong> A famous line from a famous song is shown with one word missing; the player selects their answer from a choice of four.</li>\n<li><strong>Picture This:</strong> Here the picture shown to the team looks a bit like a colour negative and the team has to identify who it is.</li>\n<li><strong>Suggs Says:</strong> Best described as questions that do not fit into the other categories and which are sometimes based on quotes. </li>\n<li><strong>A.K.A.:</strong> These are questions about the real names of famous people from the '80s.</li>\n<li><strong>Odd One Out:</strong> Example question could be \"Which of these songs was not a hit for X in the 80s?\" or \"Which band did X not play for?\"</li>\n<li><strong>1 Hit Wonders:</strong> Typically \"Who had a hit with this song?\" or sometimes \"This song was a hit for which of these singers?\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The game keeps score so there is no need for pencils and pieces of paper.</p>",

In addition to video clips of past glories and virtual tour there is a single player quiz and a multiplayer quiz.</p>\n<p>The single player 'Fan Test' is a 20-question quiz where each question is classed as an individual round. It is also an unusual quiz as it ends as soon as the player gets a question wrong. When replayed, the questions are not in the same order so the questions that the player previously answered correctly may not appear.</p>\n<p>The multiplayer quiz is for up to four players. After answering a starter question correctly, players can choose a bonus question valued at one, two or three points. The game ends when a player reaches twenty five points.</p>\n<p>There are some light hearted 'spot the ball' questions while other questions are for people who really know their statistics; for example, being shown a team lineup for a 2002/3 league match and being asked which player is missing.</p>",

Players select a category and then choose a set of questions. The game then asks 10 questions and, at the end of the round, it gives the answers. There is no in-game scoring system and the questions are not multiple choice so players will need pencils and paper to write down their answers; printable scoresheets are included on the DVD. There are no video sequences but most questions do have a still photograph. There is no voice acting or in-game music. </p>\n<p>There are five rounds to each question category, the categories are:\n<b></b></p><b>\n<ul>\n<li>Which Bond</li>\n<li>Which Film</li>\n<li>What Year</li>\n<li>Villains</li>\n<li>Bond Girls</li>\n<li>Gadgets</li>\n<li>Cars</li>\n<li>Music</li>\n<li>Pot Luck</li>\n</ul>\n</b><p><b></b>\nIt is up to the player(s) to decide whether they are playing as individuals or in teams and it is recommended that a question master is appointed, their duties being advancing to the next question when players are ready and adjudicating over the inevitable disputed answers.</p>",

        "description": "<p><i>Family Fortunes: Hosted By Vernon Kaye</i> is the second UK DVD title based on the popular television show. In the show two teams of five, usually from the same family, are asked a series of questions which had previously been asked in a survey of one hundred members of the general public. Their objective is to give the top answers that the public gave. Each answer scores points depending on the percentage of the public who gave the same answer. If a team gives three wrong answers their opponents get a chance to 'steal' the points earned so far.</p>\n<p>There are five rounds to the game which does NOT keep score for the players, instead a score pad is provided so that teams can write down their own scores:</p>\n<p><strong>Round One</strong> is always directed at Team A who have thirty seconds to write down what they consider to be the top five answers; during those thirty seconds Team B must write down a single answer in the STEAL section of their score sheet. When the time is up the players reveal the correct answers one at a time and Team A score points for every correct answer they have no matter what order they wrote they were written down. The number of points scored for a correct answer, as in the TV show, depends on the number of people in the survey who gave that answer.\nIf Team A give five correct answers then they win the round, and the points, outright.</p>\n<p>If an answer appears which Team A did not write down then Team B have a chance to steal the points, this happens if Team B's answer is present in the answer Team A did not guess or any of the remaining answers. </p>\n<p>Once Team A has finished its turn it is Team B\u2019s turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Round Two</strong> is the \"Viewer\u2019s Question\" round. Here both teams play and have just fifteen seconds to write down three answers. Either, both or neither team can score fifty points if one of their three answers matches the top answer from the public survey.</p>\n<p><strong>Round Three</strong> is a replay of Round One.</p>\n<p><strong>Round Four</strong> is the \"Double Money\" round, this is also a replay of Round One but, obviously, the points that can be scored or stolen are higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Round Five</strong> is the \"Head To Head\" round where each team selects their strongest player to play against the opposing team\u2019s candidate. Five questions are asked in 25 seconds. When time is up, the answers are revealed and if the player\u2019s answer matches the survey\u2019s answer the player wins more points to be added to their team\u2019s total.</p>",

The three games, collectively called <em>Cinderella's Enchanted Castle</em> (and labelled a \"set-top game\"), are themed around preparing for a grand ball:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the dining room the pets have knocked over several things. The narrator describes them and the player's task is to identify the item being described and click on it to see it straightened up. However, clicking on the wrong item resets the room and the player must start again.</li>\n<li>In Cinderella's bedroom the player helps her pick an outfit for the ball by selecting three items of clothing. Once this has been done they repeat the task, this time selecting an outfit to go shopping the following day.</li>\n<li>The final task takes place in the kitchen where the castle cooks are so busy they have no time to make the prince's biscuits and the prince is fond of a nibble. Cinderella helps out and the player's task is to select the items from the table in the correct order so that Cinderella can make the batter.</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p><i>You Say we Pay</i> is a DVD trivia game hosted by television presenters <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Richard+Madeley\"> Richard Madeley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Judy+Finnigan\">Judy Finnigan</a>. It is based on the phone-in segment from the duo's Channel 4 chat show <i>Richard &amp; Judy</i>. This DVD game adaption expands on the existing gameplay of <i>You Say we Pay</i> with additional game types and variants.</p>\n<p>The game does not come with any written instructions; instead, the instructions appear on an in-game menu that triggers an explanation from the game's hosts depending on what is selected. </p>\n<p>There are three game modes;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>On Your Own</b>: This game mode is for two to four players with each player competing for themselves</li>\n<li><b>Two's Company</b>: This game mode is for two to four teams of two players</li>\n<li><b>Crowded House</b>: This too is for two to four players but in this game mode every player gets to compete for every question</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The question types are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>You Say We Pay</b> The player whose turn it nominates one person who sits to one side so that they cannot see the screen and another who operates the DVD remote. The player then describes the scene/image/person on screen without using the key words in the title, and for every object in the scene the guesser guesses correctly the player earns one thousand \"You See We Pay\" pounds. This process is repeated for sixty seconds and is then repeated for each player.</li>\n<li><b>The Tables Are Turned</b>: This is only played in the \"On Your Own\" game mode, here Richard and Judy do the describing and the player does the guessing.</li>\n<li><b>Acting Up</b>: Based on Charades, this game has players mime/act the objects on screen while someone guesses what is going on.</li>\n<li><b>Best Impressions</b>: On screen, a picture of a celebrity is displayed. The player must try and impersonate the person while their teammates try and guess who it is.</li>\n<li><b>Go Fetch</b>: Household items identified within the game must be collected within a fixed period of time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The DVD remote is used to indicate whether whatever is on screen has been guessed successfully and the game keeps track of the scores so there is no need for a pencil or paper.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This title is based on the idea that the more the brain is used the cleverer it becomes. It consists of a series of puzzles designed to test, and hopefully improve, memory, numeracy and literary skills as well as logic, spatial awareness among others.<br>\nAlso on the DVD is an IQ test which the player can use to compare their score against the rest of the country. Everything is explained very clearly by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=James+May\">James May</a> a renowned television presenter and motoring correspondent.</p>\n<p>Brain training consists of ten programmes each consisting of fifteen multiple choice questions from the following types;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Core Knowledge questions: These questions take the form \"A is to B as Y is to ?\"</li>\n<li>Sudoku puzzles where the number of a nominated cell has to be selected</li>\n<li>Dice puzzles </li>\n<li>Domino puzzles which involve a sequence of some kind</li>\n<li>Missing Card puzzles, a memory test where four cards are shown and then taken away and replaced and the player has to identify which card was not in the original set</li>\n<li>Wordwheel where the player has to identify the word that can/cannot be made using the given letters</li>\n<li>BrainDrain, this involves solving a maths equation</li>\n<li>Maze puzzles: A maze is shown and the player has to select which, if any of four exits is connected to the centre</li>\n<li>Brain Box: Here the player watches a short cartoon in which brains get into and out of a box, the objective being to keep track of the ins and outs and correctly state how many brains are in the box at the end</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The game keeps a track of the player's score in these exercises and James announces the result at the end of each each test. The full IQ test uses the different types of questions each explained by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=James+May\">James May</a> and there are seventy of them in total.</p>",
