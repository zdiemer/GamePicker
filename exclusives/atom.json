The player moves a laser cannon left and right and has to shoot down all aliens that move back and forth above him or her while at the same time avoid getting hit by their fire. This variant has the same features as the Taito original, including a mother ship that occasionally moves across the top of the screen and shields to hide behind. The game is endless and when all aliens have been killed another (more lethal) wave will take their place. The aim is simply to get as high a score as possible. The score per kill depends on the position of the alien. Aliens on the bottom two rows are worth only ten points while those on the top row are worth four times as much. The player has three lives when starting out but an extra life is earned when a full wave has been destroyed.</p>\n<p>There are six difficulty levels that determine the starting position of the aliens, their descent rate and their firing rate.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The objective of <em>Demon Dungeon</em> is to escape from a dungeon full of monsters. The game is text based and the the objective is to escape the dungeon by typing directional shortcuts (N, E, S, W). The player starts at level 1 and to escape has to make it to level 5 and beyond. To advance a level the player has to find a secret passage. Each level of the dungeon consists of 50x50 cells and a map shows the player's position. Each cell on the map has a number that represents the likelihood of it containing something. This can be either treasure, magic stones or monsters. The player is helped by a red and blue status indicator, red means that the player is moving in the right direction.</p>\n<p>When coming across a monster the player can do three actions: cast a spell, throw a magic stone or run away. Spells and magic stones have a 90% chance of killing the monster but only one spell can be used on each type of monster. Running away should only be used when the spell has been used and there are no magic stones left, since there is a 25% chance that the monster will follow and kill the player. The player only has one life and has to restart from the beginning when killed. Once a game has ended the player gets a score based on if they made it out alive and how much treasure they have collected. Before starting a game the player can choose a skill level between 1 and 50.</p>",

Killer bees are swarming the earth and they are intent on destroying the player's gun base. The queen bee is indestructible and is positioned in the middle of the screen. From there she releases bees which position themselves in columns. Once a column is full the bees begin descending down towards the player who has to shoot at them to prevent them from crashing into them. One difference from Astro Invader is that the enemies here shoot at the player while in the column. When the queen has delivered 100 bees she flies away and returns with a new batch. The player has three lives and when they are all lost the game is over and the queen is able to land.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Minefield</em> is a tank game where the player has to clear all the mines on the screen. The player sees the minefield from an overhead perspective and the tank automatically moves forward until it reaches a wall or the player changes the direction. Mines will appear all over the field and the player has to clear them by shooting at them. The problem is that this creates chain reactions when other mines are within the range of the detonating mines. The player therefore, not only has to avoid driving into mines on the ground, but to keep a distance when shooting at them. The player can't take too long though since the mines will self detonate when their timers run out. The tank also has limited amount of fuel. A level is cleared once all mines have been detonated. The player has three lives in the form of tanks and when all of them have been blown to pieces, the game is over.</p>",

Some dots are larger and when collected the roles are reversed as they allow the player to go after and eat the ghosts. A level is completed when all dots have been collected. This version does not have any fruit. Instead there's a Hopesoft logo that can be picked up for a large points reward.

There are four asteroids on the screen and when shot they split into smaller ones. The larger ones are worth one point and the small ones two.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Sub Hunt</em> is a text based simulation game where the player is in command of a destroyer and has to destroy a submarine. For every turn the player is given the distance to the submarine and can decide the speed and course of the destroyer. The submarine is automatically destroyed when the destroyer gets within one mile's distance of it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Breakout</em> is a version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Atari\">Atari's</a> game with the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Breakout\">same name</a>. It works the same with the player controlling a paddle that is used to hit bricks with a ball. For each brick the player earns points depending on how far off they are. Hitting the upper half will lead to increased speed and sending the ball through the wall will lead to the paddle shrinking. When all bricks are gone another set will appear. The player has three balls and game is over when they have all been lost.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

Like its namesakes thrust controls are used to steer the craft and prevent it from falling too fast.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Black Box</em> is an adaptation of the board game with the same name. It's played on a 8 by 8 grid where the player has to deduce the positions of four atoms. This is done by firing rays into the grid and observe if they are reflected or absorbed. The game uses three modes: edge mode where rays are shot from the sides, atom mode where the player picks the positions of the atoms and the guess mode where the solution is sent and the computer will indicate which guesses are correct.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

The player is in command of the Enterprise and has to clear the galaxy of Klingons within a given time limit. The galaxy consists of 8x8 sectors with each sector containing 8x8 quadrants that the player can navigate the Enterprise through by entering text commands. The warp drive command is used to move with the player entering distance and course. Upon contact with Klingons they can be battled with phasers or photon torpedoes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Four Row</em> is an adaptation of the board game Connect Four. It's a one player game played against an AI opponent. Players drop marbles on a board and the first one to get a row of four marbles horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Space Attack</em> is a fixed screen shoot 'em up where the player has to defend Earth from an alien invasion. There are ten levels that get increasingly harder. The invaders consist of three different ship types: command ships, decoy ships and gunner ships. The commanders lead the invasion and are invulnerable. When all other ships are destroyed they will flee and reappear with another wave. Command ships and gunner ships fire at the player with the latter having a blast radius that the player has to avoid. Decoy ships attempt to land and when they do they obstruct the player's movement.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

It works like any other version of the game with the player moving left and right along the bottom and shooting at the aliens above. Features from the arcade game such as barriers and saucers are retained. The player has three lives and there are three different invaders with different score values.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Wumpus</em> is a variant of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/63723/wumpus/\">mainframe game</a> with the same name. The game is entirely text based and the player moves between caves by entering the caves' numbers. The objective is to find and kill the wumpus which can be done by shooting one of three arrows into the room where it is believed to hide. Some caves contain pits that one can fall down into and bats that transport the player to another cave.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Reversi</em> is an adaptation of the board game also known as Othello. It can be played by one or two human players or between two AI players. Like the board game it is played on a 8x8 board where players take turns laying discs. The aim is to trap the opponent's discs so that they change to the opposite colour. The player with the most discs at the end wins the game.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p><em>3-D Noughts and Crosses</em> is an adaptation of the board game Qubic which is commonly known as 3D Tic-Tac-Toe. The game plays like the original pencil game Tic-Tac-Toe but adds an extra dimension. Despite the title this version does not render the graphics in 3D, but has the four boards placed side by side. The concept is still the same, though, with the player needing to get four in a row either on a single board, vertically in a column or diagonally through the boards. It is played against an AI opponent whose level can be selected from one to five. The game is entirely played by entering coordinates with the keyboard.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Acornsoft Games Pack 8</em> is a collection of three games.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Stargate</em> is a fixed screen shoot 'em up. Three different types of enemies (gliders, swoopers and divers) warp through stargates located at the top of the screen and will move towards the player ship at the bottom. The aim is simply to shoot them down before they do so. When a stargate opens the player can disable it temporarily by shooting it before an alien appears.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Gomoku</em> is an adaptation of the Japanese board game. It's for one player against an AI opponent who compete in getting five counters in a row. The game is played by moving a cursor over the board to place counters. The program keeps a score over multiple games.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Robots</em> is a variant of the Unix game with the same name. The player controls a character that is surrounded by robots who will follow every move made. The aim of the game is to lure the robots into potholes where they will be destroyed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

The player controls Snapper through the maze and has to eat all the dots while avoiding the creatures that are chasing. Eating crosses give invulnerable allowing the Snapper to eat the creatures for a short while. Snapper was also released for the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/62787/snapper/\">BBC Micro as a standalone title</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Minotaur</em> is a first person maze game where the player's task is to transfer five gold bars from their treasure chests to a wall safe. At the same time there is a minotaur that is trying to kill the player. As the minotaur gets closer a tone is emitted that gets higher the closer it gets. When it's really close the player can choose to drop a gold bar. The minotaur will then take it and return it to a chest before starting the chase again.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Babies</em> is a variant of the Game &amp; Watch game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Fire!\">Fire!</a> The player's task is to rescue babies that are falling from a burning building. This is done by moving a trampoline left and right and a baby is safe upon reaching the right edge of the screen. The game goes on until three babies have been missed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

Each player has a castle that is protected by a wall made up of bricks.

The aim is to destroy a dam by dropping bombs from a bomber plane that flies from left to right. The bombs will bounce along the surface before possibly reaching the dam. The plane automatically moves forward and the player's controls are limited to moving up and down and dropping the bombs. At the same time it's necessary to avoid getting shot down by the enemy's anti aircraft attacks.</p>",
