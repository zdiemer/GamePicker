        "description": "<p>The nightmare for any store manager has just happened in the department store Harridges. Some goods have begun moving and are creating havoc in the store. In these conditions getting any work done is both difficult and dangerous for the manager who has to be careful not to be hit as he moves around the store. </p>\n<p><em>Trouble in Store</em> is a platform game that consists of a number of single screen levels. The player is the store manager and for each level he has to collect a key and then use it to unlock the till and get the day's takings. Each level consists of a number of platforms and moving objects such as furniture, electronics and groceries. The player has to avoid coming into contact with the moving objects or he will lose a life. The player jumps between the platforms and can also hang on to ledges and walls, something that often is needed to reach far off platforms. The game's scoring is based on how quick the player is at completing the levels. At the start the player has four lives and he gets a new one for every 10,000 points he scores. When a level is completed the player can leave through the ceiling.</p>",

It's now up to the player in the role as a fleet commander in the Xenon Space Academy to travel to it and defend it from the attack. On the route he will have to overpass many enemies and dangers before having a chance on destroying the Zorgon Battle Star.</p>\n<p><em>Xenon 1</em> is at its core a fixed screen shoot 'em up. It consists of five levels each with a different take on the genre. The first two levels are similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/14937/moon-cresta/\">Moon Cresta</a>. In the first level the player is up against the Aards, birdlike monsters that move in circles above the player. Sometimes they shoot at the player and sometimes they move down and try crashing into him. The second level works similarly but here the player has to destroy bigger variants of the Aards. These are cloned when hit, with one of the clones diving towards the player and exploding when reaching the base line. The third level is without shooting. Here the player moves through a meteor belt and has to get through it without crashing.</p>\n<p>In the fourth level the player arrives at the planet Radon. Here he will be up against paratrons, parachuting creatures that jump towards the player from the top. Depending on skill level there are between 10-30 enemies that have to be shot down. The fifth level is the final battle against the Zorgon Battle Star. To destroy it the player has to hit its moving nuclear reactor. A bonus is awarded depending on how long it takes. On all levels the player has a limited amount of fuel and will die if he runs out of it. To avoid this the player will need to refuel at the mothership's service bay.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Zorgons Revenge</em> is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/54626/xenon-1/\">Xenon 1</a>. After their defeat in the previous game the Zorgons have now kidnapped Roz, the Xenon princess. She is being held in their castle and it's up to the player to rescue her. To do so he has to search and locate four magic stones that can be found in the different corners of the Zorgon Empire. They are necessary to build a bridge over the endless chasm that surrounds the castle. </p>\n<p>The game consists of four missions. For each completed mission the player retrieves one of the magic stones. The missions can be played in any order and are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spider Mission:</strong> A platform level where the player first has to first catch a rope to get across a pit, then avoid a spider, take a lift and hit a switch to get the stone. At the same time a monster is released that the player has to avoid. There is also a flying creature that drops stones on the player.</li>\n<li><strong>Space Mission:</strong> A shoot 'em up level where the player has to shoot down a number of aliens. The player moves his spacecraft up and down along the left side of the screen while the enemies advance towards him from the right. After a number of aliens have been shot down he has to defeat a freighter to get the stone.</li>\n<li><strong>Bird Mission:</strong> A platform level consisting of three levels of platforms. The player has to reach the highest platform by catching hold of a bird while at the time avoid getting hit by the stones that rain from the sky.</li>\n<li><strong>Quadnog Mission:</strong> A platform level where the creature known as the Quadnog spits venom that the player has to jump over. When close enough the player has to destroy it by reflecting its white venom. After that he has to avoid a number of laser beams, retrieve the stone and then meet another Quadnog before getting the stone.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When all missions have been completed the player uses a crane to put the magic stones into the right place and thereby bridging the chasm. The player can then enter the castle and save the princess.</p>",

If a ghost catches him he will lose a life. To attack the ghosts the player has to eat a special item which will charge him for a short while. While charged he can then go after the ghosts and eat them. The game has nine levels with different maze layouts, colors and difficulty that can be either played through in order or picked from the beginning. The player advances a level when he has either eaten all the dots or all the ghosts.</p>",

Each player choose a difficulty level (the speed of the ball) from 1 (very slow) to 9 (incredibly fast) and a game mode (Normal or Progressive).</p>\n<p>In normal mode, the wall is static, when it is totally destroyed, another wall appears in the same place. In Progressive mode, starting at 100 points, after each 50 points the wall move toward the bottom of the screen, getting closer to your pad.

You are a pilot of the Defence Force and you have to kill waves of aliens coming from both sides of the screen.

Radar shows you where enemies (even invisible ones) and humans are located on the level.</p>\n<p>The Vulturae type of alien ships should be your primary target as they try to abduct humans to transform them into Assassins (which will try to crash into your ship). For any alien wave, if there is a time where there are no humans left, you will be warped into the Astral Plains, where all remaining enemies are turned into Wraiths, a fast skull-looking ship which tries to bump your ship away. To help you to survive, you can activate shields, the screen is then blue and you are invincible for a few seconds (6 seconds on the first wave, only 1 second in the more difficult high levels).</p>\n<p>The player uses the cursor keys to control the ship.

It consists of a number of one-screen levels (15 in total) where the player has to paint all the bricks of the platforms. This is done as the player walks over the brick. Meanwhile the player has to watch out for various obstacles that moves around. Contact with any of these lead to a lost life. Other ways to lose lives are falling from great distances or letting the time run out. The player can do no more actions than moving around, jumping and climbing ladders and therefore has to plan his movements to avoid running into obstacles. Once all platforms are painted the player gets a bonus score based on time left and moves on to the next level.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ultima Zone</em> is an arcade action game that consists of three stages with different gameplay.</p>\n<p><strong>Battlezone</strong>: The player controls his space craft left and right and has to shoot monsters knows as walkons that appear in front of him. Beneath the player are three cages with bouncing ball-like creatures called brunes. When a walkon is killed it releases a fireball that when hitting a cage releases the brunes. To complete the stage the player has to kill all walkons and brunes while avoiding being hit by the brunes or the projectiles that are dropped. The player can use the 'Radoy Shield' to protect their ship for a limited time. Shield energy is shown by the yellow gauge on top of the screen. Destroying a walkon resets the gauge.</p>\n<p><strong>The Trap</strong>: The player controls his space craft like before but in front of him he has only one cruiser (which is called henk-class) and three brunes (stationary this time). To kill the brunes the player manipulates the cruiser by shooting at its control panels. The left panel makes it go up, the right down and the central fires the cruiser's lateral maser. This stage must be cleared within a limited amount of time (the timer is the red gauge).</p>\n<p><strong>Orbit Runner</strong>: Similar to Frogger the player guides a missile through orbital defences with the aim of destroying a walkon spy satellite. The player can move left, right and forward but not shoot. </p>\n<p>Once all three stages has been completed the game restarts at a higher level.</p>\n<p>The player controls the ship with the following keyboard keys : </p>\n<p>'Ctrl' key : move left.</p>\n<p>'A' key : move right.</p>\n<p>'Return' key : Fire (Stage 1 &amp; 2) or Accelerate (Stage 3).</p>\n<p>'Del' key : Deploy the Radoy Shield (Stage 1).</p>",

Controls are limited to turning left and right. The player earns points for each pair of flags he flies through and also for flying over various things such as hedgehogs and cacti. There are also obstacles to watch out for such as rocks and rhinoceros that sometimes walks across the race track. The plane can take some damage but after five hits the game ends. </p>\n<p>At some places the player will find holes in the ground that he can fly down into and enter a cavern. Going through a cavern shortens the length of the race and down there it's possible to find wrenches that repairs some of the plane's damage. The cavern is also the place of the yellow fungus which the player has to avoid since contact with it is lethal.</p>",

Contact with enemies or walls will lead to a life lost although a shield can be used for protection.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 2</strong>: Five blocks of different sizes move back and forth across the screen at different speeds. The player has to make a stack of the blocks by pressing a key when the lowest block is directly beneath the block above it. They will then lock onto each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 3</strong>: The player is located in the middle of the screen and is surrounded by demons that shoot bombs toward him. The player has to avoid these and kill the demons with his entropy bolt.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 4</strong>: The player finds himself on a conveyor belt leading to a doomsday machine.

The enemies not only drop regular projectiles that the player has to dodge but also land mines. These sink below the surface and move back and forth, attacking the player from behind. To have these destroyed the player must kill a special green creature that appears at time. The player has as much as seven lives and when these are all used the game is over.

Like the original arcade game, it's a single screen platform game where the player has to kill various enemies by first trapping them in holes and then knocking them. This version has one notable difference though. Instead of using a shovel to dig holes the player here simply jumps on the spot where the holes shall be made. Three jumps creates a hole and the player falls down to the platform below. After an enemy has been trapped the player has to use ladders to make his way back to it and then jump on it twice to kill it. Once all enemies have been killed the player moves on to the next level. Some enemies are tougher and need to fall through two holes to die. The player has four lives and any contact with enemies lead to one being lost.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Killer Caverns</em> is a rudimentary action game where the player takes control of poor Helpless Harold, the only man who knows the location of a secret treasure chest. The treasure is placed deep down into a well, but whoever placed it there broke the ladder into seventeen sections and scattered them in the killer caverns. The player has to find all the sections, one at a time, and bring them back to the well. The game is viewed from a side perspective and the controls are very simple with only two keys to control Harold's movement, left and right. Harold will come across many dangers in the caverns, such as snakes, falling stalactites and various monsters and the gameplay involves simply avoiding contact with these by timing movements right. Some luck is also needed since dangers tend to pop up randomly without prior warning. The player has five lives and when they are all used the game is over.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Frelon</em> is an action game where the player takes control of a helicopter whose task it is to rebuild a bridge. The bridge is needed so that a truck can enter enemy territory. The problem is that the pieces of the bridge are scattered around five interconnected screens that the player has to traverse from a side view perspective. After locating a piece the player moves over it to pick it up and returns it to the bridge where it is properly put in place. What makes this harder are the enemy forces that do everything they can to stop the player from fulfilling his job. Planes, tanks, rockets and falling objects are all things that the player has to avoid or shoot down. Crashing into these, the ground or their projectiles will lead to a life being lost. The player also has to watch out for the helicopter's fuel level or else it might explode. There are nine different difficulty levels to choose from and when one is completed the game automatically moves on to the next one. The game ends after three lives has been lost.</p>",

At the same time there are monsters roaming the corridors that the player has to stay away from unless he has collected a special pill that allows him to go after them instead. There are also strawberries that can be collected for a larger amount of points. In addition to the first person view there is also a radar that shows the location of the monsters and the player.

In it a rampart of the citadel Caspak is being overrun by strange creatures known as Ohmphals and the player's task is to stop them from reaching the top. As they climb up the rampart the player controls a man that can run left and right at the top of it while throwing rocks at the attackers. If they are hit they fall down and they take with them all climbers beneath them. The game goes on until any of the attackers reach the top. The difficulty of the game can be customized by altering the speed of the player character, the falling rocks and the enemies.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Probe 3</em> is a shoot 'em up played from a fixed third person perspective. The game uses pseudo three dimensional graphics where enemy space ships start far off and move towards the player's craft which the player views the back of. The player's controls are limited to moving left and right and shooting. To hit an enemy the shot has to be timed so that it strikes when it's at the correct distance. The attackers come in waves and to defeat a wave twenty of them have to be destroyed. Beneath the player's craft is a blue planet and in the second and subsequent wave there will be missile attacks from the planet surface. Every attacker that player let's past will land on the surface and increase the amount of missiles that are launched. Missiles have to be dodged since they can't be destroyed.</p>",

Before that the invaders only move back and forth in a formation of six rows. The player can get killed by colliding with a descending alien or by getting hit by a projectile. The game ends when all three lives are lost. When all enemies have been killed the game moves on to a new level which plays in the same way.

A wizard has sent a number of magical ice giants to destroy the player's fortress. Mounted on a winged battle beast, the player has to prevent them from doing that by simply shooting them until they die. The giants, who appear in waves of five, slowly walk towards the fortress and if they manage to reach it the game ends. The player can also die by getting hit by the magical snowballs that the giants throw. After completing the first few waves, magical snow that kills the player on contact will start falling.</p>",

If the player doesn't manage to eat another fruit before it runs out the amount of fruit needed to complete the level increases. Once enough fruit has been gobbled a hole opens up in the top wall that snake can escape through. In addition to walls there are bouncing balls that have to avoided.

Any two keys on the keyboard can be used except D, arrows and space. The space bar is used to jump in long jump and throw in javelin while the arrow keys are used for adjusting the angle in javelin. The D button can be used for doping but only once and it is possible to get caught and eliminated from the competition. After all events have been played through medals will be awarded in each event.</p>",

The player ship has dual 'pew-pew' cannons, aiming in the center of the screen without crosshairs, hitting an enemy will destroy it - adding to the current score, but the resulting debris has to be avoided by quickly sliding sideways as the remains pass by. If you miss completely, the enemies fly past the bottom/sides of the screen, but new will appear on the horizon, until the first three waves are over, when the scene is changed.</p>\n<p>After the surface skimming on the first planet levels, the next levels are in space, which means more vertical movement is used for aiming.\nEach type of enemy ship is also accompanied by a unique sound.</p>\n<p>Eight waves of enemies are to be fought off, and then a new 'universe' is loaded, with more enemies looking for revenge.\nThe attacks go on as long as you have ships, of which there are 5 in total. \n(The number for 'universe' has four digits, so it may be up to 9999 levels, if anyone could ever get that high.)</p>\n<p>There is no ship HUD, the interface is for score keeping, remaining ships and waves/levels.\nA highscore is kept from previous games, but no hall-of-fame list.</p>",

Actually, the game is available for one or up to 9 players, which are trying to be this general. Starting with a certain budget, each turn the player should make such financial decisions for National Defense, Agriculture, Environment, Foreign Trade, Foreign Policy, Industrial Sector, Education, Transport, and Leisure, which will not lead to the anarchy and his death. In the end of each turn, the player may also throw some money to the Public Sector and Social Help. One turn is equal to one year in power. Single-player and multi-player modes have their own specifics.</p>\n<p>In the single-player mode, the player takes a role of the general, who is a head of San Th\u00e9odoros and in chief of revolutionary forces \"Le Picaros\" (The Rascals). The player wins, when the contract defined as a number of years in power will be fulfilled.</p>\n<p>In the multi-player mode, each player is a head of certain San Th\u00e9odoros province. Taking turns, the generals play on the same screen, and they can declare war. The winner will be the general, who eliminates all his opponents. To complicate this task, each player is encouraged to hide his screen from the eyes of other players.</p>",
