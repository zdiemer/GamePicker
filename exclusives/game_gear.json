        "description": "<p>Long ago, the evil Cablon ravaged the Copto planet, a light year away of the Algol system. When he was defeated, he was sealed on a planet discovered by Alis, the heroine of the first \"Phantasy Star\", a planet that was also known as Alisland. In this <em>gaiden</em> (side-story) set in Phantasy Star universe, you play the role of two young people from the village Tedo - Alec and Minina. One day, Minina finds an old artifact. While wondering what that could be, the young people learn that Alec' father was attacked and kidnapped by bandits. Determined to find him, the two heroes embark on a dangerous journey that will eventually lead them much further than they suspect. </p>\n<p><em>Phantasy Star Gaiden</em> plays pretty much like any other <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Phantasy+Star+series\">Phantasy Star</a> starting with the second game: both towns and dungeons are in top-down view, the turn-based battles are viewed from first-person perspective. The gameplay is standard console-style RPG: you should fight random enemies, gain experience and gold, buy better equipment, visit many towns and dungeons, etc.</p>",

Arle, the heroine of the series, is a little girl who studies magic. One day, she goes into a forest, only to notice that something terrible happened to it and its inhabitants, the fairies. Is this the work of the archenemy, Satan-sama? That's what Arle has to find out!</p>\n<p>Like most other <em>Mad\u014d Monogatari</em> games, it takes place in 3D maze-like dungeons, which you should explore, find treasures, and fight enemies. The turn-based, random battles are viewed from the same first-person perspective as the dungeon exploration. You fight using a variety of magic spells.</p>",

The events of \"Last Bible Special\" take place in an alternate Middle East in the beginning of the Christian era. You play as Materu, a young warrior who gets an assignment from the bishop of Jerusalem to travel to four dungeons. The demon king Graias is controlling other demons who found their hideout in those dungeons, and it's your task to defeat them.</p>\n<p>Unlike the three previous Last Bible games, \"Last Bible Special\" features 3D first-person dungeons, like in mainstream <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Shin+Megami+Tensei\"> Shin Megami Tensei</a> games. The game is heavier on dungeon crawling: you cannot travel on the world map, but are taken automatically to the huge dungeons which you should complete in a specific order. In the town, you can buy items, as well as recruit party members. The battles are random and turn-based. Like in all Megaten games, you can communicate with the demons you encounter and convince them to join your party.</p>",

Now she is sixteen and she can still remember the spells she has learned long time ago. One day she meets a fresh young man who without any apparent reason casts a powerful spell on her. Arle finds herself locked in a prison cell. Grabbing the key, she runs out of the cell, only to find out she is imprisoned in a huge dungeon populated by vicious monsters...</p>\n<p><em>Mad\u014d Monogatari II</em> retains the gameplay system of the previous game. You navigate Arle through first-person 3D dungeons. Enemy encounters are random. During the turn-based battles, you can attack only with various types of magic. Since you don't see your own hit points, the key to winning the battles is to choose appropriate spells against various types of monsters.</p>",

Arle has no choice but to run away, and she falls down through a trap into a dungeon. It appears she is now alone there, because the first creature she meets in this dungeon is a frosh king. He asks Arle to use her magical powers to defeat the monsters in the dungeon and to find a way to escape from Minotaur and the mysterious woman.</p>\n<p>The gameplay of <em>Mad\u014d Monogatari III</em> is similar to the two previous games.

The usual Aleste powerup systems remains fairly intact. You still have powerup pods which release P capsules for upgrading your main weapon. On the other hand, secondary weapon upgrades are no longer released from ground bases, but from another type of flying pods. When you start out, your secondary weapon is a laser, which can later be replaced with powerups ranging from split fire to napalm rockets and target seeking power balls. Both primary and secondary weapons are in constant use, since only button 2 is used for firing both weapons at once. Due to the smaller screen estate of the Game Gear, the sprites are larger and the playfield more constrained, for which the game compensates somewhat by introducing multidirectionally scrolling sections.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Though it shares its Western title with the Master System shooter, <em>GG Aleste II</em> takes place in the far future, and not the steam-punk 1930s of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Power+Strike+II\">Powerstrike II</a> for the Master System. As in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/20838/gg-aleste/\">GG Aleste</a>, you're the woman pilot of a space fighter faced with the task of saving the world by destroying a lot of alien spaceships and technological plantlife.\nThe gameplay in GG Aleste II has been further refined since its predecessor. Before starting out, you're given the choice between all the secondary weapons, with suggestive names such as <em>Hammer Hawk</em> or <em>Rising Masher</em>. These are upgraded in the same vein as in GG Aleste until you reach a frightening potential, covering the screen in bullets and napalm explosions. As a last resort, you're also given the ultimate weapon; a smart bomb destroying all enemies on-screen. Unfortunately, you're only given one bomb per life. As far as the weapons arsenal goes, this is the pinnacle in 8-bit Aleste versions. The graphics have been revised with a clearer look which turns out better on the Game Gear's fuzzy screen.\nPerhaps taking a cue from the Sonic games of the time, the bonus levels are in 3-D, giving you the chance to earn bonus points and extra lives by shooting down as many baddies as possible in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Galaxy+Force\">Galaxy Force</a> style.</p>",

Ax Battler!</p>\n<p><em>Ax Battler: A Legend of Golden Axe</em> is an action game with RPG elements, which puts the player in the role of Ax Battler, the Barbarian from previous Golden Axe games in search for the Golden Axe. The gameplay feels much like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7296/zelda-ii-the-adventure-of-link/\">Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</a>, with Ax moving around in a top-down perspective, changing to a side scrolling view when fighting enemies or entering caves.</p>\n<p>The battles are random and Ax won't see the enemies coming. If he's hit during a battle, the battle will end instantly and he'll be sent back to the overworld map. If he prevails, he gets magic vases from the enemies. Magic vases are the game's currency and are also used to cast spells, just like in the other Golden Axe games, but instead of having only the \"Earth\" magic, he also has the \"Thunder\" and \"Fire\" magics. Ax can also use special attacks to fight his enemies, learned at \"dojos\" found in each city.</p>\n<p>Instead of battery backed RAM, this game uses passwords as a mean to save games. At each town the player enters, he'll find a place to learn a new password which, when entered, allows him to continue from the very point it was learned.</p>",

Rather than a fanciful approach like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Punch-Out!!\">Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!</a>, the developers went for a more strategic sim. Differently from its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=010086012156\">Genesis counterpart</a>, the game is played from a first or third person point of view, with the fighters facing each other directly. The player can choose to see the fight from his or from the opponent's point of view (\"through his eyes\").</p>\n<p>Players can either play a quick exhibition match or fight their way through the Career mode, using a created boxer to work their way up the 15-boxer ranking list until they fight Holyfield himself. During character creation, players can choose the fighter's head, color of skin, trunks and hair, physical and mental attributes. The physical attributes are dominant hand, power, speed, recovery and stamina. The mental attributes are style (brawler, dancer, boxer and dodger), killer instinct (low, medium or high) and favorite punches (jabs, straights or hooks aimed at head or torso, one for each hand). Between matches, career mode offers various exercises to assign the boxer to improve his stats.</p>\n<p>The players can choose the view mode (normal or reverse), three kinds of control schemes, round length (up to four minutes) and fight length (up to 12 rounds).</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Game Gear version of the grand old lady of war simulations, <em>Daisenryaku</em>, arranges a war between the fictive Red and Blue countries. On one of thirty different maps, units are produced and moved out into combat, and the war is only over when the enemy capital has been conquered.</p>\n<p>Three basic phases make up each turn: production, movement and combat. Each city or airbase within a distance of five hexagons from your capital may produce one unit each turn, as long as your funds allow it. Each turn yields new funds, whose amount is proportional to the number of cities and airports you have occupied.</p>\n<p>Units are moved on the map, which is based on \"fake hexagons\"; the hexagons are in fact square, but offset on each row so that each square borders six other squares. Each terrain type has different movement and defence values, which makes movement and combat more complicated.</p>\n<p>The outcome of combat is determined by the attack strength which varies between different unit types, and by their experience. Each time a unit survives combat, it gains experience points and eventually gains in experience level, which makes the chance of winning in combat higher. As each unit is in fact a squadron of ten, a typical combat will only destroy a certain number of the members of the unit.</p>\n<p>An additional moment in the gameplay is the recharging phase. Units which have lost members can be built up to full force in a city or airbase, and those which have run out of ammunition can do the same. Ammunition can also be replenished in the battlefield using supply trucks.</p>\n<p>A total of thirteen airbourne and land-based units are available. Some units cannot fight other units; tanks can do nothing against bombers, and mechanised infantry can't protect itself well against a howitzer two squares away.</p>\n<p>The game can be played both against the computer or against another human player by linking two Game Gears together.</p>",

On a top-down, horizontally scrolling playfield, armed robots are moved around in a manner similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/33598/super-robot-taisen/\">Super Robot Taisen</a> strategy games, albeit without many of the refinements of that series.</p>\n<p>Each game starts at the shop, where robots on your team are bought and equipped according to your tastes and finances. After that, the game begins in the robot arena, blue team against red team in one corner each. The goal is not explicitly to destroy the robots of the opposing team, but to destroy their base. In order to reach their base, and to prevent them from reaching yours, a certain amount of fighting is required. Each turn is split into a movement phase and a combat phase, and since actions of both sides are only executed when a phase is over, you cannot know when moving how close you will get to your opponents.</p>\n<p>Robots are available in three basic classes, from light to heavy, but can be modified with new movement units (different terrain squares have different movement properties), better armour and new weapons. Different weapons have both different strength and different ranges, as well as a limited supply of bullets. Reloading is done during the combat phase, but requires that your robot stays out of combat during that turn. Different sensors and command units can also be added, giving the robots better aim or particular abilities such as dodging, shielding and healing.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Game Gear version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=%E3%81%8D%E3%81%AD%E5%AD%90\">Kinetic Connection</a> has been rearranged a lot from the original version released 5 years earlier to cope with a smaller screen and Sega's taste in motifs.</p>\n<p>As the original version, <em>Kinetic Connection</em> is a jigsaw puzzle game, where the pieces are animated. This makes putting the pieces together to form the overall picture both more interesting and more difficult, since the player can not analyse each piece at his own pace when the entire puzzle is moving about. Pieces also need to be flipped around both on the X and Y axis in order to fit together.</p>\n<p>The game has 7 puzzles, some of which are carried over from the earlier versions but mostly new ones designed with Sega characters. Due to the small screen, the pieces are not kept in a box at the bottom of the screen as in the original <em>Kinetic</em>; instead they are all placed out on the grid already, in a random order. Each puzzle can be played in three different modes:</p>\n<p>Mode 1 lets the player swap pieces around as he likes. Mode 2 lacks one piece and lets the player slide pieces around as in a sliding puzzle. Mode 3 lets the player slide entire rows and columns around in the puzzle. The two second modes call for much more thought when solving the moving puzzles.</p>",

It seems to be completely abandoned except for some mine cart tracks. As he lands on the island a cart approaches, and Tails hides in the bushes. The passing silver cart is driven by a woman who says she is Wendy Witchcart. She proclaims that everything on the island is hers and threatens to transform everyone in crystal who does not follow her rules. Tails, determined to save all the animals on the island, sets in a chase to the Witchcart.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is fairly similar to the Sonic series. Tails need to defeat enemies and complete obstacles. He can fly, but is constantly suspended. He carries a golden ring that is used to take out enemies or to latch on to devices. Sonic, the emeralds and Dr. Robotnik are not presented, and neither are there rings to collect during the levels.</p>\n<p>The game came to other territories as an unlockable minigame in the GameCube version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Sonic+Adventure+DX:+Director's+Cut\">Sonic Adventure DX</a> and as one of the titles in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Sonic+Gems+Collection\">Sonic Gems Collection</a>.</p>",

During these times a group of pro-democratic rebels, led by Guy Freelander, has obtained a secret taped meeting between top government officials and ABC directors discussing their diabolical plans.  Convinced that if they play the tape through ABC's broadcasting, they can convince the repressed population to rise up against the current regime.  The only problem that stands in their way is the way to the broadcasting center, a death trap nicknamed the maze.</p>\n<p>The player takes control of Guy Freelander and must transverse this maze, with 20 levels and 100 different rooms in total, using a standard gun and a knife to take out security guards, androids, mutants and must avoid various pitfalls and traps scattered in these rooms.  The view of the game is isometric and has a password feature to allow players to pick up and return to the previous room they were in without having to replay the previous levels.  There are no life bars, instead the player can take four hits before their character dies with five lives.  After losing these five lives, the game will be over.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Sports Trivia: Championship Edition</em> is a mix of football and sports trivia. The main premise of the game is set on a football field, choosing plays on either offense or defense they than are answered a series of sports-related trivia questions. Answering more questions correctly in a certain amount of time will determine how well their quarterback will pass or how many yards their running back will gain. Alternatively, the same applies to the defense where if a player answers more trivia questions correctly, the better the chance of a sack, interception, etc.</p>\n<p>There are eleven different sports categories that range from football, baseball, hockey and boxing clear up to college sports and even auto racing. Each question is given in multiple choice format and players are allowed five audibles (an alternate question) for each half. The player has the option of either competing against the computer A.I. or against a friend.</p>",

Each character has a unique ability vital to some stages such as Storm's and Rogue's ability to fly while Cyclops and Gambit has long range capabilities and Wolverine's raw power.</p>\n<p>The story starts off with the world in peril as a deadly virus called the Legacy Virus is spreading throughout the world and is threatening to extinguish all of mankind. The X-Men learn of a cure that has been developed by a scientist by the name of the Gamesmaster and ask for his help, but in order to obtain the antidote they must first compete in a series of games scattered throughout the world by beating up various enemies and avoiding pitfalls and traps. To make matters worse, Gamesmaster has promised the X-Men's arch-rivals that if they can stop the X-Men from completing their tasks that they can have the antidote and destroy the only hope for mankind.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is a 2D side-scrolling beat-em-up with eight stages total that range from the Arctic to Egypt and the Moon with the ability for the player to choose the location they wish to explore first at the beginning of the game. Players must advance through these stages using their powers, which are in limited supply, beating up various enemies and creatures and face off against an end level boss for each stage.</p>",

Now you must manipulate the conveyor belts skillfully to deliver the correct product to the right person waiting outside, but you have only a limited amount of time. Unfortunately, thugs with bats or even guns patrol the factory. Your only weapon against these security guards is a battle cry that temporarily stuns them, but not for too long.</p>\n<p><em>Factory Panic</em> consists of four rounds, and each round consists of eight stages. Before a stage starts, the game tells you how many people are waiting in line and what product they are waiting for. Rounds one and three are played in \u201cSwitch Mode\u201d: step on different switches to rotate associated sections of the conveyor belt. If you get off the switch, the section rotates back to its initial position. One switch may affect more than one section. Since you can only step on one switch at a time, you have to bustle quite a bit in later stages. Rounds two and four are played in \u201cBridge Mode\u201d: remove and install small bridges between the belts to control the flow of products.</p>\n<p>If a person gets an unwanted product, the time remaining on the timer will decrease. Sometimes, the belt carries special items, e.g. a megaphone that makes your scream attack more powerful, or a weight that can be placed on a switch.</p>",

        "description": "<p>From Sega 8-bit specialists <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Aspect+Co.+Ltd.\">Aspect</a> comes one of many adaptations of Tim Burton's 1992 superhero sequel <em>Batman Returns</em>. Like other versions, it is a side-scrolling platformer. While very similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/42830/batman-returns/\">Master System version</a>, the Game Gear version has slightly different levels and gameplay mechanics.</p>\n<p>Batman must move through five stages on his way to defeat the Penguin. These include the streets and rooftops of Gotham City, Max Shreck's department store, the sewers, and the Penguin's lair. For the first four levels, a route can be selected from two options, allowing for different paths through the game.</p>\n<p>Enemies standing in Batman's way can be defeated by throwing the Batarang at them, which will take out most baddies with one or just a few hits, even though the weapon's range is limited. Other tools Batman can use are a grappling hook to pull himself up to higher levels or swing across dangerous areas, and his cape, which can be used as a parachute, for more control during falls.</p>\n<p>Unlike in the Master System version, Batman can take more than one hit: he has a health bar, which can be refilled with powerups hidden in bat symbols.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The game is based on the famous 1990s animated series of the same name. The player takes control solely of Batman, as the Joker has kidnapped Robin in order to lure Batman into a game. Furthermore, the Jokers lets Gotham's most feared criminals compete with one another in order to distract Batman. Naturally, Batman has to take care of the other master criminals, too, while trying to free Robin.</p>\n<p><em>The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin</em> is 2D platformer/ beat'em up. The goal in each stage and level is to walk from left to right to reach the (sub)boss and the end of the stage. To beat his foes, Batman uses punches and kicks in close combat and several weapons for short distances. Batman has an unlimited supply of Batarangs with him from the beginning, and there are four more weapons available. Apart from simple jumping, Batman can also perform a double jump to reach higher places and can hold on to ledges.</p>",

Several X-Men characters are playable throughout the game. The player can choose from two characters from the start, Cyclops and Wolverine, and three Levels are accessible. In the course of the game, the player can unlock five other X-Men, namely Storm, Iceman, Rogue, Nightcrawler and Psylocke.</p>\n<p>The story is that most of the X-Men have been kidnapped by Magneto, which is the reason why only Cyclops and Wolverine are available from the start. Apparently, unlocking the characters equals rescuing him. On the way, there several foes from the X-Men universe to beat, and at the end, Magneto once again needs a reprehension.</p>\n<p>The basic mechanics of the game are punching, (double-)jumping and jump-kicking. Furthermore, pressing Start activates/ deactivates the characters mutant ability, for example Wolverine's claws or Cyclops' laser beams. Using it however drains a limited amount of energy, which can be refreshed by finding \"X\"-symbols.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Y\u016b Y\u016b Hakusho: Horobishi Mono no Gyakush\u016b</em> is based on the manga / anime series <em>Y\u016b Y\u016b Hakusho</em>, which is about the teenage delinquent Yusuke Urameshi, who is appointed as an \"Underworld Detective\" after being killed in a car accident while trying to save a child's life. His task is to investigate various cases involving ghosts and demons in the human world.</p>\n<p>The game is a classic side-scrolling beat'em up and offers several characters from the manga to play. Apart from, as expected, Yusuke the player can choose between Hiei, Kuwabara and Kurama. All characters have different values in five attributes like jumping or speed. The game offers some variations from the standard beat'em up formula: There are four different levels accessible from the beginning and can be played through in any order. However, after completing a level, the player has to choose a new character he hasn't used yet for the next stage. If a character looses all his health, he has to fill it up with the health of the other characters and thus weakening them for the later levels. The game also switches to different mode for the boss fights. By turns, the player has to dodge an attack from the boss and then do a attack on his own by pressing Punch at the time when a moving cross-hair is over the boss.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Y\u016b Y\u016b Hakusho II: Gekit\u014d! Shichi Ky\u014d no Tatakai</em> is based on the the manga / anime series Y\u016b Y\u016b Hakusho, which is about the teenage delinquent Yusuke Urameshi, who is appointed as an \"Underworld Detective\" after being killed in a car accident while trying to save a child's life. His task is to investigate various cases involving ghosts and demons in the human world.</p>\n<p>While the first game was a side-scrolling beat 'em up featuring four characters from the manga, the second game is a one-on-one fighting game. The game though does take a different approach than games like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9465/street-fighter/\">Street Fighter</a>, as you do not control the movement of your character, as both opponents stand still. You fight by pressing a combination of buttons to make your character perform a certain attack. The efficiency of the attack depends on two factors: The position of a moving cross-hair on the body of your opponent, which determines the spot you attack, and the amount of energy in a displayed \"move gauge\" which increases over the time. To perform a special attack, you also need a certain amount of Ki energy which is displayed in another gauge. The Ki regenerates while it's not used further, and without Ki a player is limited to only normal attacks. The triggered attacks are then displayed in an anime style animation sequence showing both opponents doing their corresponding move.</p>\n<p>In single player mode (a two-player mode is available via linking two Game Gears), one may either play a tournament or single fight against a character of one' choice. However, not all fighters are accessible from the beginning (the single combat mode also starts with one character less than the tournament mode) and must be unlocked by progressing in the game (progress is saved with passwords). Altogether, there are seven characters to choose from: Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, Hiei, Itsuki, Toguro and Sensui Shinobu.</p>",

Each of the nine levels of the game is based on a unique concept or gameplay mechanic. These include escaping from a giant boulder, riding a mine cart, or a ski ride down a steep mountain (Indiana Jones sends his regards). Several levels are auto-scrolling: one sends Taz sliding along across icy surfaces, another forces him to follow a tree log down a river with the catch that he can't stay on it too long or it will sink. </p>\n<p>If there are any enemies in Taz' way, he can jump on top of them to dispose them or alternatively use his trademark whirlwind spin. The spin also allows him to jump higher and farther, but will also drain his health. This in turn can be refilled by picking up snacks lying along the way.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Pop Breaker</em> is a puzzle game with action elements. The goal of each level is to destroy certain things. The basic way to do this is to shoot them, but there are various obstacles which need to be circumvented, e.g. mirrors which reflect shots; the direction is indicated by small arrows on the floor. Destructible blocks are distinguished by their colour, for example a purple block becomes blue when shot once and vaporizes after the next. Enemies are also capable of destroying blocks. Reflected own and enemy shots (along with mines on the floor) can kill the space ship, but extra lives can be earned by collecting power ups. One speciality is that the player can change the position of the gun; either left, right or central.</p>",

Tarur\u016bto-kun, who can be described as a kind of magical super hero, flies through the levels while blasting away evil monsters. As the game is based on a humorous license, the enemies are unusual, e.g. a waking piano which throws with musical notes or jumping soccer balls. Tarur\u016bto-kun can withstand three hits before dying. Occasionally he meets his associate Mimosa which leads him to a separate screen where he can choose one of the unlimited weapon systems, e.g. enemy-seeking rockets or a multi-shot. On offer are also power-ups which can be used only a limited times like sleeping gas or a power scream.</p>",

Thus the infamous duo sets out to search the whole town for enough cash.</p>\n<p>The game is basically a jump'n'run game and cannot be called platformer, since the are no platform. All stages consist solely of one linear floor. The main goal of each stage is just to get from left to right. However, at one point in the game, you reach a ticket counter, and you cannot proceed if you do not have enough money to buy the concert tickets. So apart from reaching the exit, each stage must be searched for money, which both lies around and is contained in lockers, dustbins, coin-operated telephones and other things. Sometimes, even primitive puzzles must solved, e.g. by picking up books and selling them in the book shop.</p>\n<p>The stages are filled with all kinds of life decreasing obstacles, mostly bombs, moving objects or vermin. Beavis and Butt-Head have no means of attacking or defending, so everything must be evaded. The player controls only Butt-Head, Beavis is just following and will do any action delayed. However, if any one of the two is hit, you loose energy (which can be restored by picking up food). Possible actions are running, jumping, ducking, picking up items and interacting with the object in the background (if possible).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Kishin D\u014dji Zenki</em> is based on a TV and anime series. With help of demon spirit, the master of the Enno temple, Enno Ozuno, was able to defeat the demon goddess Karuma centuries ago. In present time, this demon spirit, called Zenki, appears again, after having been sealed in a column by Enno Ozuno - Zenki was freed by Ozuno's descendant in present day, a school girl called Chiaki Enno. However, Zenki has only the form of an ill-mannered child, and Chiaki can only transform him into a useful form by using a magic bracelet. Together, Zenki and Chiaki must avert the threat caused by the seeds of Karuma, who started to appear and transform people into monsters.</p>\n<p>The game is a platformer which lets you control either Chiaki or Zenki, which both have different abilities. While Chiaki can break stones with her powers to clear the way and look for power ups, Zenki has spinning attack. Like in Sega's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/18544/asterix/\">Ast\u00e9rix</a> games, you choose at the beginning of each level which character to play. Further, the level can be left to pick the other one. For boss fights, the game switches to a different mode reminiscent of one-on-one fighting games, where Zenki faces the opponent in a more powerful form.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</em> on the Game Gear is a fighting game that mixes one-on-one versus fighting with some brawling/beat'em up elements.</p>\n<p>The game's story mode consists of seven battles against monsters (and the evil Green Ranger) sent by Rita Repulsa to destroy the Power Rangers. Each stage consists of two segments: in the first, the selected ranger must face some Putty Patrols in the beginning, which can usually be dispatched in just a few hits. A short appearance by Goldar follows, and once he is driven off, the actual main boss of the stage appears and must be beaten to reach the next part. In this, the monster will usually morph into a larger version of itself and the Power Rangers must use their Megazord mecha to defeat it.</p>\n<p>Before each stage, any of the five rangers can be selected to play the next level. Once the Green Ranger has been defeated, he also becomes available as a playable character, and for the Zord stage, the player can choose from the Megazord and Green's Dragonzord in either standard or fighting forms.</p>\n<p>The Game Gear's two buttons are used for punches and kicks, while pressing both at the same time is used for powerful attacks like throws and uppercuts. Each character also has three unique special attacks.</p>\n<p>In vs mode, any of the game's characters (six rangers, three zords, six monsters and the putty patrol) can be selected for one-on-one matches against a randomly selected opponent. Link mode allows two players to compete against each other via the Gear-to-Gear cable.</p>",

A player can play as Godzilla or similar monsters (kaiju), like Anguirus, and Fire Rodan. Should players want to support humanity they can play as the G-Force, a human defense force. Humans have monster killing tools such as, tanks, artillery and planes. Some monsters are unplayable enemies and both sides will have the chance to fight against them.</p>\n<p>On the map, the game is a typical war strategy. The player can move units on the map, and attack enemies. Battles have their own screen and animations. The fighting is quite arcade-like and simple, functioning similarly to fighting games. When all units have used their actions points a turn ends. </p>\n<p><em>Godzilla: Kaijuu no Daishingeki</em> has four maps, and an extra secret level.</p>",

In addition, an All-Madden team can be used in Exhibition games only. </p>\n<p>The game features selectable quarter length, timeouts, flippable plays, freely definable audibles, quarterback substitutions, variable weather (which can be turned off for Exhibition games), optional color commentary from John Madden (called \"Maddenisms\" in the menu), and detailed stats. Gameplay is seen from a top-down perspective with the field scrolling vertically. During rushing plays and kick returns, the Game Gear's two buttons are used for a variety of moves by either tapping or holding: diving, hurdling, speed bursts and spins are possible.</p>",

It is based closely on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/66127/madden-nfl-95/\">previous year's game</a>, with one important difference: it loses the NFL license, thus featuring only generic team names. Still, teams, stats and schedules are based on the 1995 NFL season, with the two new expansion teams and rule changes like the two-point conversion included.</p>\n<p>The main game modes Exhibition, Season and Playoffs return unchanged from the previous game, and a new Sudden Death mode has been added. 30 teams plus the traditional All-Madden team are available. Features, controls and graphics (top-down vertically scrolling) are mostly unchanged from the previous game. The main changes are a redesigned frontend/menu system, reworked playbook, the addition of injuries, and substitutions now being available for all positions, not only quarterbacks.</p>",

While the gameplay mechanics are identical, there are some significant changes. Foremost, the game adds a story: the player takes the role of a boy who searches for his mother who wanted to visit a neighbour town. Unfortunately, the only thing he finds is a huge wall. When trying to sneak through a hole, he is transported to a strange, hostile place...</p>\n<p>Each level (one non-scrolling screen) consists of several platforms which are interconnected with ladders. Another thing which is found in the levels are monsters which walk around and try to catch and kill the main character. His only way of defense is the hammer which is used to punch holes in the platforms: when monsters walk over them, they get stuck. When using the hammer on those trapped monsters, the platform is filled up again, the monster falls down and is killed. There are two added benefits: a falling monsters is deadly to other monsters and it leaves a power-up behind, e.g. an extension of the time limit or a stronger hammer.. Sometimes the player encounters boss monsters which require a bigger hole.</p>\n<p>While some levels are based on the arcade version, others are different. This version also adds a shop where the player can buy power-ups. It can be visited before taking on the world's boss.</p>",

These include skid row at night, uptown during the day, the harbor, a subway train, the countryside and a mansion. Numerous Dragon Lord goons stand in Billy's way and must be taken out with punches and kicks. Each of the six large levels concludes with a boss fight against an extra large enemy. In a departure for the series, Billy is able to pick up guns (with a limited amount of shots) at various points during the game, allowing him to dispatch foes easily from a distance. By collecting various power-ups, Billy can increase his health bar and the number of continues. A statistic after every level details amount of hits taken and dealt.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Game Gear received a unique adaptation of the 1997 dinosaur sequel <em>The Lost World: Jurassic Park</em>. It is primarily a side-scrolling platform game but also includes some other gameplay elements. Players control a hunter who, armed with a stun rifle and having enlisted the help of a friendly Procompsognathus (\"Compy\"), must make his way through various levels on Isla Sorna to finally reach a helicopter and escape.</p>\n<p>The next level to be played can be chosen on an overview map of the island, allowing for some freedom regarding level order. In the standard platform levels, the goal is simply to reach the exit. Various dinosaurs must be avoided or taken out with the gun and environmental dangers like sand pits, rock avalanches and water holes must also be mastered. The gun's ammunition is unlimited and the hunter can take several hits before losing a life - his health is indicated by the color of his shirt. Replacement body armor is available as a power-up. In one of the levels, players don't control the hunter but Compy instead. Compy can only take one hit before losing a life, and instead of a gun, he has a jump attack. He also has the ability to climb walls.</p>\n<p>After most platform levels, a boss fight against an especially large and/or dangerous dinosaur follows, each attacking in a certain pattern requiring its own strategy to defeat. Variety from the standard platforming comes in a level where a raging Triceratops attacks from the left and the hunter must run for his life through the automatically-scrolling landscape. The final escape from the island takes place in a car, seen from the front (i.e. driving towards the screen), with a T. Rex attacking from behind. Both the dinosaur's attacks as well as obstacles on the road (like boulders and water puddles) must be avoided to reach the goal.</p>",

While there is no NFL license, the included teams are based on the 1995 season and include the two expansion teams Carolina and Jacksonville for a total of 30 teams. Gameplay is seen from a horizontally-scrolling view from above the field. The playbook allows choosing from over 90 plays.</p>\n<p>The baseball module also includes Exhibition and Season games with a password function. It allows the setting of game length from one to nine innings and the toggling of automatic running. 28 MLB-based teams are available (but without an official license). Gameplay follows the standard model of the time: pitching and batting are seen from a view behind the batter. When a ball is hit, the view zooms out to show the entire field for running and catching.</p>",

Five years after the events of the original, alien hunters Ricky and Mary are called back into action when a distress call from the space transport Dagal is received. More alien creatures have invaded. They need to be destroyed and the crew rescued.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is very similar to the original game: players select either Ricky or Mary (the difference is only visual) and must clear the levels (seen from an overhead perspective) by rescuing all crew members within a time limit while fighting off aliens. A map can be called up at any time to check where the crew members are. Panels in the walls reveal weapon power-ups, including lasers and flame throwers. Rescuing the last crew member opens up the exit. Upon leaving, a boss fight follows.</p>\n<p>The game includes five different levels, four of which represent decks of the invaded ship. All are completely new designs not seen in the original game. Certain enemies are reused from the arcade, however, including most bosses. The final level consists solely of a boss fight against a new alien.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Tom and Jerry: The Movie</em> is a tie-in to the 1992 animated film of the same name starring the famous cat &amp; mouse duo. It is similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/39767/tom-and-jerry-the-movie/\">Master System</a> version in gameplay, but has its own story (which is unrelated to the film) and entirely new level designs.</p>\n<p>Tom has found a treasure map while playing in the attic. With Tom dreaming about how to spend the treasure, Jerry grabs the map and runs away. Now Tom has to chase Jerry to get back the map, running after him through five different levels, starting from Tom's house and continuing in the city streets, a cruise ship, a deserted island and finally a hidden labyrinth.</p>\n<p>The game is a side-scrolling platformer. Tom's goal is to catch Jerry who always runs along at the right side of the screen. If Tom gets close he can try to grab Jerry, which ends the level, but if he misses, he loses a small amount of health. If Tom can't catch Jerry before the level end, he has to face one of Jerry's friends in a small boss fight.</p>\n<p>Multiple dangers abound in all levels: platforms that fall away under Tom, objects falling from the ceiling and bouncing along the way. Jerry himself also has tricks up his sleeve, throwing land mines and cherry bombs at Tom. If Tom gets hurt, he can refill his health by picking up a life potion.</p>\n<p>After successfully completing a level, one of two bonus rounds follows: Tag is a labyrinth game. Seen from the top, Tom chases Jerry through a maze. Picking up heart icons refills Tom's health and catching Jerry before the timer runs out increases Tom's life bar. Apples and Bombs has Jerry dropping either apples or bombs from a row of windows. Tom must catch the apples but avoid the bombs, which stun him temporarily. Catching 3 apples refills health whereas getting 24 or more of them increases the life bar.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ernie Els Golf</em> is a handheld golf game for up to four players. The game is similar to other golf games of its time with the golfer being viewed from a behind perspective when swinging and then switches to a top down perspective when the ball is in the air. A three click power bar is used when taking shots. On the first button press it start moving back and forth and by pressing again the amount of power is set. The third press decides the slice of the shot.</p>\n<p>Before a shot the player can choose which club to use and change the golfer's stance as well as the position of the ball. It's also possible to see a top down view of the hole. After the shot has been taken it's possible to see replays from three different views. The game supports mulligans which means that a shot can be undone. The number of mulligans can be chosen by the player. </p>\n<p>There are four different courses from around the world: St. Davids in Britain, Sunny Lakes in the USA, Hokkaido in Japan and Sydney in Australia. The first two have 18 holes while the later two have nine. The game features seven different game modes: practice, stroke play, match play, threesome, foursome, stableford and skins game.</p>",

The game is a side scrolling platform like the original game, with largely the same features, but it contains more locations and different level design and graphics. The story is the same with CJ attempting to escape his captivity and return to Africa. Unlike the original game he starts out in London and not in Paris (which here is the second location) and on his journey he will pass through the Alps as well as Egypt before reaching his destination in the African jungles. Each location consists of a few levels and ends with a boss. </p>\n<p>The gameplay mechanics are the same as the previous game with the player jumping between platforms while avoiding or killing the various bad guys. CJ can fire nuts through his trunk and lob bombs at enemies and when falling he can use an umbrella to land safely. The player starts out with nine lives with three hearts for each. A heart is lost when getting hit by an enemy and when all out of them a life is lost. More hearts can be picked up throughout the levels.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Magic Knight Rayearth</em> is based on the manga series of the same name, in which three Japanese schoolgirls find themselves in the magical land of Cephiro, where, as the Magic Knights of legend, they are tasked with rescuing the princess Emauraude from the evil Zagato.</p>\n<p>The game tells a side story set near the beginning of the girls' adventure. Their guide and companion, the rabbit-like creature Mokona, has disappeared into the Spirit Forest, and the three must venture out to find him. This quest is presented as a Japanese-style RPG, but with several unique elements.</p>\n<p>Unlike in many games of the genre, there is no main world map filled with towns and dungeons. The game world consists of a number of small interconnected areas instead. Scattered around the world are buildings like inns where the group can rest and the game can be saved, and shops where items can be bought. Other buildings contain characters that can give hints and advice regarding the quest. </p>\n<p>The main part of the game consists of random battles, done to level up and win gems that are used as currency. There are some similarities to the ATB system known from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4572/final-fantasy-ii/\">Final Fantasy IV</a> and its sequels in that while actions are selected from a menu as in a standard turn-based game, the action continues during menu selection and characters need some time to recharge before they can act again. The major interface element during battles is a spinning slot-machine-like reel at the bottom of the screen that includes images of the three protagonists. The spinning speed can be lowered or raised at the push of a button. While a girl's full body is in view, she is in recharging mode. Only when the view zooms in on her portrait she can be selected for action by stopping the reel while her portrait is in the center. This then allows her to select from standard 'attack', 'magic', 'item' and 'flee' commands. Sometimes, random effects (sent by Mokona) will pop up instead of a girl being selected. These include health restoration, automatic flight, putting the enemy to sleep or even an instant kill. There are also negative effects, though, like the draining of a character's health.</p>",

Half of the planets are re-arrangements of the Genesis ones, and the other half are unique to this iteration. Some of Ristar's moves and various enemy mechanics have been tweaked or expanded. Also unique to Ristar on Game Gear are collectable mini-stars scattered throughout the levels, which award an extra life on collecting 100.</p>",

The hero must defeat Gamma's forces in order to rescue his love.</p>\n<p><em>Devilish</em> is a Breakout variant. Instead of the screen remaining stationary, the game screen will scroll forward once the ball (called a power orb in this game) passes through a barrier. The game consists of eight stages. Players control a paddle and have to hit a power orb at barriers in order to break through them and the orb can also be used to destroy enemies too. The paddle itself can be configured into four different formations which are an offensive and defensive position and an L and reverse L formation. </p>\n<p>Stages must be completed before time expires. Stages also contain treasure chests that can contain either a time bonus, a 1-Up, a Buster Ball that can break through any barrier, and a Flash Bomb which will destroy any blocks surrounding it when it explodes.</p>\n<p>The game offers a regular game mode and a time trial mode. The time trial only includes the first six stages. Options let the player choose between an easy, normal, or hard difficulty and also let the player select the number of power orbs they have available at the start.</p>",

There are three modes including the Story Mode, a Battle Mode and a Player versus Player Mode. The story is now told in snapshots with character avatars. Combat encounters work a lot like the prequel with characters have their own moves, but the player fights single tough opponents instead of multiple weak opponents.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the world of Moldorian two races humans and magi live in peace, until this peace is fractured by the recent appearance of monsters across the lands. A youth named Navarre and his companion Miria go on a small adventure but when Miria is kidnapped, Navarre gradually finds himself in the thick of the conflict. Many of the game's mechanics both in town, outdoors and combat work like Final Fantasy. The most significant feature in the combat system is pressing a button and direction together to perform an action. The player can have a maximum of two companions to go with Navarre. As the game progresses, the player will be joined by a different character at a certain point.</p>",
