Meanwhile, Biosyn Corp has sent men down the former park so the company can gain control of the park for themselves.</p>\n<p>In this 2D shooter, Player 1 controls Dr. Alan Grant and Player 2 controls Tactical Sergeant Michael Wolfskin and alone or together you face off against the free roaming dinosaurs of the once known Jurassic Park along with the members of the Biosyn Corp.  Your player always has six weapons.  Your primary machine gun and cattle prod are unlimited and most take down both the humans and dinosaurs but some only work the dinosaurs such as the cattle prod.  Most of the levels are non linear so you must explore different pathways to complete the mission you have selected once you have once you selected either one or two player mode.</p>",

Flute follows you (although you can order her to stop and stay), but also can be grabbed and thrown at the enemies (yes, thrown at the enemies). Flute can also collect through all the stages some costumes that, when worn, give her special abilities, such as flying, leaping, breaking walls or even explode and kill all in screen. At the end of each stage, of course, you\u2019ll find the typical boss, all named as musical instruments.</p>",

The mysterious power of Mana is also the center of all events in <em>Seiken Densetsu 3</em>. Years have passed, and all the destructive powers of Mana have been securely sealed by Mana Swords into eight seeds, all placed in eight different kingdoms. But some people know about those sealed powers, and they don't want to free them for the sake of humanity, but for their own gain - such as the kingdom of Altena, which is slowly freezing and which can be saved only by the legendary powers.</p>\n<p>The game features several plot lines connected to each other by their common background. In the beginning of the game, you are offered to choose a group of three among six different characters of different classes: Duran the Fighter, Angela the Magic User, Lisa the Amazon, Carlie the Cleric, Kevin the Grappler and Hawk the Thief. Each one of them has her/his own background story and dwells in a different land. Gradually, the connections between those different characters become apparent, and the seemingly loose story lines are connected into a whole.</p>\n<p><em>Seiken Densetsu 3</em>, like the previous game of the series, is an action RPG, with real time combat.</p>",

Its events take place ninety-nine years prior to it, and it explains the origin of the series' antagonists, the group of super-humans known as the Sinistrals. The player controls the ancestor of the first game's protagonist, the swordsman Maxim. After having encountered a mysterious woman named Iris, Maxim goes on a journey to find other heroes who would help him to stop the Sinistrals from destroying the world.</p>\n<p>Like the first game, <em>Rise of the Sinistrals</em> is a Japanese-style turn-based RPG with many puzzle elements thrown in. The game makes extensive use of puzzles in its dungeon layouts; various items and accessories must be used to solve them. It also features a \"Capsule Monsters\" system; monsters can be summoned to fight alongside the party in battles. They would evolve when fed weapons, armor, or special fruits. Unlike in the first game, there are no random battles in the dungeons: all the enemies are visibly moving on-screen.</p>",

Well, you might end up with something like Death Valley Rally. The object is pretty simple: Race the Road Runner through each level as quickly as you can while collecting different colored flags, which are worth different amounts of points. When you reach the ending, if you're fast enough, you'll also get a time bonus, but if you're good enough, you'll get a flag bonus. Some of the flags are INCREDIBLY difficult to find, and the fact that you won't usually be able to find them, will challenge (or at least frustrate) most gamers. You can run, turbo run (by stocking up on bird seed), peck, and jump in this wild adventure, as you try to catch the escape the ever-witty Wile E. Coyote and his assorted ACME contraptions.</p>",

        "description": "<p>You have been called by the Master to restore life to the Friel empire. The ruler, King Magridd, struck a deal with the evil Deathtoll - in exchange for the soul of one living being, Deathtoll will give him a piece of gold. Magridd's greed got the better of him, and, thinking of the millions of souls of every living creature around the world, readily agreed to the deal. But Magridd himself has since disappeared, and the the land is now devoid of life - instead only filled with Deathtoll's monstrous minions. Will you be able to save Friel's subjects from their horrible fate?</p>\n<p><em>Soul Blazer</em> is an action RPG in the style of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=045496830076\">The Legend of Zelda</a>. Like <em>Zelda</em>, battles are not turn-based - the player directly attacks enemies and dodges them. As they progress, they also unlock special items which allows them to complete tasks for characters or access special areas (such as the Dream Rod, which transports you into someone's - or some<em>thing's</em> - dream). Unlike <em>Zelda</em>, the game has an experience meter, and the player levels up and becomes stronger as they defeat enemies. The game's unique hook is that there are \"Monster Lairs\" spread all over the land of Friel. When they destroy all the enemies in a lair, they don't come back, and when they step on the empty lair, it restores part of the game world, bringing back anything from plants, to animals, to people, to buildings and more. Each restored soul helps in some way - for example, the player can climb regrown ivy to reach new areas, reunite families by bringing back husband and wife, rebuild cities by restoring architects, and talk to characters to complete even more quests.</p>\n<p>The player's main goal is to find six Stones, which allow them to gain access to the World of Evil, where Deathtoll resides. These stones are guarded by key characters in different parts of the world, usually the rulers, who require the player to defeat a boss character to rescue them. While most of the game allows them to progress in a linear fashion, there are certain souls that can only be restored by killing monsters that can't be harmed with their earlier weapons. The player will need to find special weaponry and then backtrack to previous areas to rescue these souls. It's also advisable to revisit previous locations, as certain characters may have new sidequests to complete which can reward them with new items to make them even stronger.</p>",

You will earn money for each race depending on how you placed (for instance, first place nets you $7000) which you can use to purchase upgrades for your car. You need to find a good balance between the parts. To test the effectiveness of your parts you can run a test race to see how the car works before you buy. Data can be saved on the cartridge so you will not lose your parts or your race statistics. The goal is simply to complete all sixteen tracks; you will get a bonus at the end depending on how well you do so there is an incentive to play again and do better.</p>",

(In the fifth skill level, there is also a Flag Ship, and the game is lost if either one is destroyed.) Scenarios are laid on on a hexagonal grid, and each space has its own terrain type and can be occupied by one unit. You move your units around and attack enemy units in adjacent hexagons. There are also cities, airports, and shipyards, which you can occupy and use for your own purposes (ie. to repair a unit). Depending on the skill level or scenario you can also construct factories to produce additional units.</p>",

There are a total of 20 levels with 4 boards per level of increasing difficulty. Happy hopping!</p>",

Every weapon has also a massive 'smart' bomb feature, wiping out mostly everything on screen at once if invoked. There are also some <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5960/r-type/\">R-Type</a> style space shooter levels thrown in for good measurement. Very arcady with tons of action.

        "description": "<p>This game is based on the anime and manga by manga artists CLAMP.</p>\n<p>In the land of Cephiro, the world was kept in peace and harmony by the wishes of Princess Emauraude, the Pillar of Balance. But the evil priest, Lord Zagato, has kidnapped Emauraude, and Cephiro is being invaded by deadly beasts. If this continues, Zagato will gain complete control of Cephiro! The only ones who can stop him are the legendary Magic Knights...</p>\n<p>And those Magic Knights are three young girls from Earth. Hikaru Shidou, Umi Ryuuzaki, and Fuu Hououjii have been plucked from modern-day Tokyo and brought to Cephiro by Emauraude, and they're the only ones who can defeat Zagato...as the Magic Knights!</p>\n<p>This interpretation of the manga story is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the three main heroines as a party; each one uses different weapons and learns various skills. Typically for the genre, the party roams the top-down world, visits towns, descends into dungeons, chats with non-playable characters, and fights randomly appearing enemies in turn-based style.</p>",

One of the more successful releases of the Super Nintendo's twilight era, Uniracers mixes platform-based high-speed racing, with crazy stunts and tricks.</p>\n<p>The basic idea in most levels of the game is simple. Get your unicycle from A to B as quickly as possible, and finish ahead of your opponent. It's like Sonic, but with none of those pesky enemies, pointless power-ups and frustrating obstructions. In fact it doesn't sound like much of a game at all...</p>\n<p>Here's the key, though. Tricks performed and landed during the race increase your speed. The better the trick, the greater your increase in speed will be.</p>\n<p>Also, some levels are set in areas designed solely for stunts. Such levels require you to earn as many style points as possible, by doing tricks. These levels are against the clock, and a set points score, rather than an opponent.</p>\n<p>Unicycles are stupid and difficult, and yet fun, once you get the hang of them. Much the same could be said about Uniracers...</p>",

        "description": "<p>After the Awakening, magic has been re-discovered, and human beings have accepted the existence of those they thought to be fantasy creatures. Mega-corporations and cyberworlds had to give space to elves and Native American shamans. Jake Armitage was a seemingly ordinary data courier, assassinated by a hit squad in the year 2050 in Seattle, Washington. Miraculously, his true story began after his death. A mysterious figure approached Jake and cast a spell on him; after that, he woke up in the morgue. </p>\n<p>Jake doesn't know what happened to him, he doesn't even remember his own name. He is contacted by a shamanistic Dog totem with a cryptic message about his mission. Wandering through the large city where monorails, computers, and street gangs armed with automatic weapons co-exist with orcs, dwarves, and vampires, he begins to unravel the mystery, gradually learning about dangers awaiting him around every corner, and his own past.</p>\n<p><em>Shadowrun</em> is based on the pen-and-paper role-playing game of the same name, more specifically on the novel <em>Never Deal with a Dragon</em> by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/63118/bob-charette/\">Robert Charrette</a>. It is entirely different from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6649/shadowrun/\">Genesis adaptation</a> of the same license. The game is a skill-based RPG with action-oriented combat. Most of the time Jake uses firearms; he can also learn magic spells, primarily with defensive and support capabilities. The player can hire \"deckers\", temporary party members who can aid Jake in battles, and to whom the player can assign basic commands or let them be controlled by the AI.</p>\n<p>Karma points are awarded to the player for successfully eliminating enemies. These act like experience points in other RPGs and can be manually distributed by the player. The player can increase the character's basic parameters (such as hit points or charisma), as well as have him master various skills. These include firearms, computers, negotiation, leadership, and others. </p>\n<p>Jake can also use his cyberdeck to access cyberspace known as the Matrix, for plot-related purposes or in order to obtain money. Represented by an icon, Jake moves through the cyberspace, fighting programs that protect data from intruders. Jake's success in these endeavours largely depends on his computer skill.</p>\n<p>Dialogue with non-playable characters plays an important role. Most quests involve Jake exploring various locations in Seattle and gathering information from people. Conversations are topic-based; often it is necessary to learn about a particular topic from a specific character and then choose it in a conversation with another one to obtain the necessary information.</p>",

Now the boy is six years old, and Papas brings him to his hometown. After some time, they learn that Henry, the prince of Reinhart, was kidnapped by bandits.

Though the party only includes three active human combatants, the game allows the player to recruit monsters into it. Some of the enemies will randomly request to join the party. The player can then add them to the roster and use them in battles, where they behave just like any other combatant, using their own abilities and even leveling up.</p>\n<p>The game follows the story of Papas' son stretched over many years, from his childhood to adulthood. The player will be able to choose a wife for the main character from two available female characters. This decision influences some of the subsequent events and features.

It's time to go to the village elder, to get a seemingly simple assignment - to sell some goods at a bazaar in the nearest town. But soon the hero will discover his dream was not so far away from reality...</p>\n<p><em>Dragon Quest VI</em> is the last Super Famicom/SNES game of the <em>Dragon Quest</em> series. It is a party RPG with turn-based combat and battles viewed from first person perspective. Gameplay style, setting, and even menu layout are very similar to those of the previous games in the series. The game utilizes an enhanced \"class system\" from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dragon+wariior+II\">third game</a>. Characters can choose different classes to belong to, and switch between them. The more a character fights while belonging to a certain class, the more proficient he/she becomes in it. Once two or three starting classes have been mastered, the character gains access to powerful hybrid classes, which grant the characters new abilities and various upgrades.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The planet known to its inhabitants as Earth is composed out of two realms - the surface, or Lightside, and the underground world, or Darkside. Two cosmic forces, called God and Devil by the humans, were fighting each other fiercely until their final battle in Antarctica led to a catastrophe: the continents of the surface world submerged into the ocean, presumably eradicating all life on the Lightside.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the isolated underworld, consisting of frozen crystal mountains and lava rivers, continues to exist. A young boy named Ark grew up in Crysta, the only remaining village on the Darkside. One day, he and some other boys hear mysterious voices coming from beyond a door the village elder forbade them to open. Unable to resist their curiosity, the boys open the door, and Ark finds a box with a strange creature inside. By opening the box, Ark inadvertently causes all the villagers to be turned into stones. In order to bring them back to life, Ark has to find five towers within the dangerous Darkside and eventually restore life on the surface of the planet.</p>\n<p><em>Terranigma</em> is an action role-playing game. Ark levels up after having completed an important quest or cleared out an area. He can attack enemies with various weapons, using different techniques: pierce, leap, dash, etc., resulting from the combination of three basic actions - attacking, running, and jumping. Special objects called Magirocks can be collected and converted into rings, which act as one-use items capable of casting magic spells.</p>\n<p>The game is closely connected to and often regarded as the final part of a trilogy, the first two games being <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7134/soul-blazer/\">Soul Blazer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7011/illusion-of-gaia/\">Illusion of Gaia</a>.</p>",

In this role-playing game the player controls two main pilots from the series, Noa Izumi and Isao Ota, as they complete their typical duties each day, helping to deal with rogue Labors (Mecha) and other such incidents.</p>\n<p>The gameplay consists of three modes - a map of Japan, showing where assignments are located, the \"main\" screen, where the player controls the Labor from a top-down viewpoint and maneuvers it around the area of the crime, and the combat screen, for when you press the action button to attack a rogue Labor. From here it is possible to select one of various attacks; naturally, as the game goes on the pilots can learn new attacks. Unusually for an RPG there is also the option to just talk with the rogue Labor's pilot and try to convince them to back down - as a policeman, sometimes this is the only way forward.</p>",

The \"revenge\" or \"miso bomber\" feature was introduced in this game.  That is when a player dies they can still throw bombs in from the sidelines in an attempt to swap places with a player that is still alive.  Many new powerups were added in this game including the Kangaroo which in addition to giving a player and extra hit allowed them to have some extra ablity including jumping, laying rows of bombs, and high speed running.</p>\n<p>Players are also not limited to the traditional Bomberman.  There is a wide selection of different characters that the player can choose from.</p>",

Each character has a special power from a jet pack to throwing abilities.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The storyline of <em>E.V.O.: Search for Eden</em> follows the same patterns as modern Evolution theories. The players first controls a prehistoric sea organism, and fights to gain evolution points with which he can improve his fish's body parts and upgrade his attack/defense abilities. The gameplay is not completely linear, which means that certain choices of paths and stages will affect the player's success.</p>\n<p>The game is composed of a series of stages, in which the sea organism slowly evolves into an amphibian, and later a land-only creature. The physical changes are fairly scientifically accurate which gives the game a semi-educational purpose as well.</p>\n<p><em>E.V.O.: Search for Eden</em> is based on the Japan-only computer game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/50507/46-okunen-monogatari-the-shinkaron/\"> 46 Okunen Monogatari: The Shinkaron</a>. While the basic premise of the game is the same, there are significant changes in gameplay and the layout of the game world.</p>\n<p>In the computer release, the battles against other creatures were turn-based; here, the combat is real time, which effectively turns this version into an action RPG. The stages, while retaining similar themes, have a completely different layout. Side-scrolling view prevails over the original's top-down perspective. There are also boss battles that were absent in the original version.</p>\n<p>Character building (\"evolution\") is also different. Instead of distributing evolution points into four parameters, the player now basically \"buys\" upgrades, which have a fixed \"price\". The player is able to acquire such upgrades for the creature's body parts (jaws, neck, body, etc.), raising their parameters and becoming stronger.</p>\n<p>Story elements, friendly characters (NPCs), and quest-based structure that characterized the original game have been reduced and/or omitted in this release.</p>",

The player, controlling Bugs Bunny, is able to jump (and squash), high-kick, throw cream pies and use ACME weapons. These weapons are scattered all over the landscape and include such cartoon favorites as bone-shaped dynamite sticks, anvils to drop on heads, Shrink Rays, portable holes and many more. Players will encounter a variety of familiar Looney Tunes characters as enemies and level bosses. At the end of each level (10 in all). players are given a rating based on their gameplay style, which includes how many of these ACME weapons they were willing to use.</p>",

Seeing this logo, the slugs determine that ours is a race made up of BONES and of ADVERTISING, two things the slugs simply hate. So they attack.</p>\n<p>With the slug invasion in full swing, earth is quite simply outnumbered by the gooey slugs. It must recruit special super soldiers, Big Sky Troopers, armed with a special heavily armored suit to combat the menace. So urgent is the need for qualified Big Sky Troopers, that recruiting and rank are petty things. It is not unknown for example for a brand new trooper to start as a 21-star general in the army.</p>\n<p>Once selected, it is up to your Big Sky Trooper, piloting a FIDO class starship, to engage the slugs in space and in planetfall and thwart their plans to destroy mythical galactic devices and conquer humanity.</p>",

Suddenly, Adol notices a bottle, thrown onto the shore. It contains a letter, written in a foreign language, in which an unknown person asks Adol to come to the land of Celceta and save it from a mysterious evil. Adol decides to accept the offer, and thus his new adventure begins.</p>\n<p><em>Ys IV: Mask of the Sun</em> is one of the two games bearing the fourth number in the series, the other one being <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/25660/ys-iv-the-dawn-of-ys/\">The Dawn of Ys</a>. Though quite different in general, the two games share the same basic plot and are both sequels to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/13596/ys-ii-ancient-ys-vanished-the-final-chapter/\">Ys II</a> and prequels to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Ys+III:+Wanderers+from+Ys\">Ys III</a>. Like the first two games in the series, <em>Mask of the Sun</em> is a top-down action role-playing game. Its combat system is similar to that of the earlier games. with slight modifications. An enemy should be rammed from the side in order to inflict damage; if performed incorrectly, the player character will get hurt himself. Magic is learned from equipping various swords with elemental properties.</p>",

There is nothing but desert in Kefin area, but a legend tells a city was once was there -the city of Kefin. There is a rumor a legendary treasure is hidden somewhere amidst the ruins of the city. Who will dare to explore the dangerous region and to uncover the mysteries of the past? There is one who dares - a red-haired swordsman named Adol Christin.</p>\n<p><em>Ys V: Ushinawareta Suna no Miyako Kefin</em> is the fifth installment of the Ys series, and the first one to depart from its trademark \"bumping\" battle system. Combat has been somewhat modified to resemble a more traditional action RPG style, requiring the player to actively press a button to execute an attack rather than simply running into enemies. Adol can fight monsters using melee and magical techniques, and defend himself by pressing a button at the right time. The ability to jump has also been added, though it is rarely used for platforming purposes. Magic can be learned by acquiring and combining elemental orbs in the inventory, creating new spells. Separate experience points are awarded for vanquishing enemies with swords or with magic. </p>\n<p>A few months later after the game's initial release, a tweaked expert version was released. This version included tougher enemies, a time attack mode, as well as a new dungeon to explore.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A young boy named Ratix lives in the town Clatos on a planet with medieval culture, together with his best friends Dorn and Milly. They belong to respectable families of warriors and healers, and excel in battles kills. One day, a letter from a neighbor town arrives. A strange disease has plagued the town and its inhabitants plead the healers of Clatos to help them. Milly's father decides to go, but he himself catches the disease. The young adventurers must save Milly's father and other people at all costs. But in the beginning of their journey, they discover a crashed space ship with people who belong to a much more advanced civilization. People from two different worlds must work together to solve the grand mystery.</p>\n<p><em>Star Ocean</em> is a Japanese-style role-playing game that contains some stand-out features, such as Approval Rating: people like or dislike each other and their behavior towards Ratix and within the party might change depending on their feelings to him and your own actions. The combat is fast-paced, real-time: the player controls Ratix, while other party members are AI-controlled. It is possible to customize combat tactics by assigning roles to the protagonist's companions, and pause the combat at any time to make strategic decisions.</p>",

You have to determine the future of a little princess. Fill up the schedule for her, buy her weapons and armor, train her in combat, make her study and prove she is worthy of her title. Or just let her eat and sleep all day and see how she gets lazier and dumber day by day.

And fell asleep.</p>\n<p>Boy, did he pick a bad place to take  a nap.  Several hours out of port he woke up and found himself in deep trouble (and more than a little seasick).  The ship's captain believed his story about being an accidental stowaway.  But... only in cases of extreme medical emergency could the ship return to port.  And Lester wasn't that seasick.  Yet...</p>\n<p>So, he was along for the ride...  until the first port of call.  But as chance would have it, pirates hijacked and scuttled the freighter.  Luckily enough, Lester found a life vest before the ship sank and swam for the nearest tropical island.</p>\n<p>Just before reaching the beach Lester passed out from sheer exhaustion.  Now, his real adventure begins...</p>\n<p>It is up to you to help Lester get back home.</p>\n<p>You'll face such things as giant seagulls, panthers, pirates, and the spirits of the underworld.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This text-based adventure (with some background graphics) was originally released in Japan over the Satellaview system. The game is a spin-off from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/1517/chrono-series/\">Chrono series</a>, and is the precursor to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3810/chrono-cross/\">Chrono Cross</a>. Its main characters and plot elements are very close to those of <em>Chrono Cross</em>; it tells the story of Serge (travelling musician), Kid (thief), and Magil (wizard) as they attempt to steal the Frozen Flame from Viper Manor. The game contains multiple, often humorous endings. </p>\n<p>Gameplay is something between a standard text adventure and a visual novel. Rather than having a full array of possible actions, players are limited to the several options it presents at any time. With newly discovered items and information, new areas can be reached. Occasionally battles will occur during the exploration, which are also handled by displaying several possible actions to choose between, such as \"Run\" or \"Jump back as it swings!\"</p>",

Only Slowpoke escaped and sent for his cousin, the fastest mouse in Mexico... Speedy Gonzales! Following the trail of the Bandidos, Speedy will enter each level and try to rescue as many mice as possible while chasing after cheese and avoiding natural hazards. Ariba! Ariba!</p>\n<p>The gameplay in Speedy Gonzales resembles the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Sonic+the+Hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> series of games more than anything else. For the most part Speedy will run, run across fields and up slopes and into tunnels. There are also mousetraps which function similarly to Sonic's trampolines and will propel Speedy into the air. Speedy has a short range kick for attacking and can occasionally pick up items and use them at a later time.</p>",

In the game you play the son of the hero in the first game, Shadax. Shadax has been kidnapped by an evil witch and it is up to you to rescue him. </p>\n<p>There is a wide range of weapons and powerful magic spells you can use throughout your quest, some of which are required to solve puzzles. In the game you can travel on the above-ground map as well as the underworld, although all the action except for some battles will still happen underground. Basic gameplay concept is reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Zelda\">Zelda</a> games: you must search for keys, blasting or avoiding monsters, solving physical puzzles on your way to the meeting with an end-level guardian whom you must defeat to progress.</p>",

Thirteen years ago a strange disaster befell this world and killed many people. Upon the ruins of a great city and sealing back a great evil, a school of magic was built. Young Chezni is a student of that school of magic, striving to become a great spiritualist and control the elements. Meanwhile, a dictator to the south, Zaygos has conquered the entire continent and seeks to conquer the other half of the world. One day, after class Chezni is dared by a fellow classmate to enter and explore the forbidden tower that sits outside the school of magic. Entering the tower, Chezni will soon learn of the machine, Dal Gren that has been sleeping there for 10,000 years. What consequences will his actions have?</p>\n<p>Paladin's Quest is a 1-player RPG where the player moves around the world and in locations using an overhead view with up to four members in the party. Randomly encountered monsters engage in a first-person view battle mode that is played using turn-based commands to each player. Along with weapons, magic is available and uses the character's own hitpoints to command. There is no healing magic and no healing items, rather some characters have \"bottles\", one type of which can restore HP and these can be filled (nine uses per bottle) at most towns. Each character has a different profieciency in one of eight different elements, which may be combined to produce additional spells. New element usage can sometimes be learned by main characters in temples.</p>",

        "description": "<p>There exists a prosperous town named Rococo built on all the latest modern conveniences. Living in Rococo is a famous inventor, Dr. Akihabara and his son. All is peaceful until suddenly a group known as \"Hackers\" appear and begin causing trouble. The Hackers and their robotic monsters take part in robberies, vandalism and destruction around the world. Dr. Akihabara leaves on a voyage determined to thwart the Hackers plan, leaving his son behind in Rococo. As strange things begin to happen in and around Rococo, Akihabara's son decides to investigate. Idolizing his father and also wishing to grow up to be an inventor, he builds himself a robotic fighting machine and sets out on his Robotrek...</p>\n<p><em>Robotrek</em> is a fantasy RPG with sci-fi and steampunk elements. Players take the role of Akihabara's son, living in his lab at Rococo. The majority of the game is an overhead view, traveling through areas, talking to people and using items. Early on in the game, the player will learn how to create a robot in the laboratory and will use this this robot in a side-view battle mode to combat monsters and gain experience. The robots can be upgraded and equipped with different types of weapons, both found and invented. The player can have a total of three different robots to choose to send to battle, which allows customization strategies for certain situations and enemies.</p>\n<p>Akihabara's son will also need to think up new inventions to thwart the challenges in front of him. He gets the ideas for these inventions from talking to people or witnessing events which cause a lightbulb to go off above his head. New items then become available for production in the lab. Also, many existing items including his own inventions can be combined properly in the lab to create new items and weapons. Items no longer wanted can often be turned into scrap which sometimes is also able to be combined.</p>",

A village serves as hub in which Rooks can visit places like a fortune teller or shops to buy items and equipment. On the world map, which does not offer free movement, he chooses his next destination where the dungeon crawl begins. The battles occur randomly and are turn-based: during each turn, the player chooses the next action of a character from a list of actions, e.g. attack or magic.\nEventually the characters advance their experience level and therefore their stats.</p>\n<p>The main visual characteristic of the game is the display of monsters and characters: everything is represented with cards. They can have an elemental attribute or not. Rooks is able to summon an elemental to aid him. He can only summon one type at a time, and he must find them before being able to summon them. Two more characters can join the party.</p>",

The background story is based on the manga/anim\u00e9 of the same name. The years is 199X, and the world lies in ruins. Technology can no longer be used, and the land is controlled by fighters of rivaling styles. In this game, you can choose one of the fighter characters of the series: the main hero Kenshiro, his brother and rival Raou, Nanto Seiken fighters Rei and Souther, the assassin Heart, and others. You fight one-on-one, filling an energy bar and performing various attacks and techniques. There is a free fight mode where you choose your opponent yourself, and a two-player mode.</p>",

However, before he can rescue the princess, he must first overcome 24 levels filled with enemies and obstacles. Fortunately, Dirk has both his trusty sword and the ability to used ranged weapons (axes, knives, &amp; shuriken) at his disposal. </p>",

He lives in Tokyo and enjoys a life of an average teenager: he studies in school, works as a waiter on a part-time job, hangs around with friends, and so on. But one day, he meets a mysterious girl named Pai. Pai is the sole survivor of an ancient race called \"sanzhiyan\" (Chinese for \"three eyes\"). Long ago, they discovered the secret of immortality, but as a result they lost their human form, and some of them mutated into horrible demons. Pai's dream is to become human again. Yakumo's father was her trusty friend, but he died, and wished his son would continue helping Pai. At first Yakumo doesn't feel very enthusiastic about that, but through a bizarre accident his nature becomes inseparable from Pai's, and he becomes immortal himself. He has no choice but to help Pai. They travel around the world, from Hong-Kong to Mexico, seeking their lost humanity, and fighting the remains of the demonic race.</p>\n<p><em>3x3 Eyes: Seima K\u014drinden</em> is a Japanese-style RPG set in modern times. Player-controlled characters can travel from location to location by plane, or riding Pai's winged demon. On their journey Yakumo and Pai meet other characters who join the party, and visit cities and dungeons, where they fight enemies in turn-based style. Battles are viewed from first-person perspective. Every character has various spells and techniques which can be used in battles.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>J\u016bma H\u014dkan</em> is based on the manga series <em>3x3 Eyes</em>. Long time ago, in ancient China, a group of people discovered the secret of immortality. They became \"sanzhiyan\" (three-eyed ones) and possessed supernatural powers that were manifested in a third eye each one of them had. One of the sanzhiyan, a girl named Pai, longed to become a normal human again. She was aided by the Japanese scientist and explorer Fujii, who then disappeared in Tibet under mysterious circumstances. Fujii's son, Yakumo, became connected to Pai by merging his soul with her and becoming a \"wu\", an immortal being. Now they both travel around the world, trying to regain their human essence, and having their base in Hong-Kong, working for Li Lingling, the head of the Monster Fighting Agency.</p>\n<p>This game follows the story of volumes 8 to 11 of the manga. Lingling discovers a letter left by Fujii, where he reports about a strange tribe that can control beasts. Yakumo is ordered to travel to Nepal, but first he has to find more information about the mysterious tribe by contacting people in Hong-Kong.</p>\n<p>The game is a mixture of puzzle-solving and side-scrolling action, with the emphasis on the first. Yakumo moves around the game world, picking objects and manipulating them in order to solve puzzles, and talking to characters. But he can also jump, climb on ladders, run, and sometimes fight enemies in side-scrolling style.</p>",

Only then will he and his comrades be ready to face Homncruise and save the world.</p>\n<p>In this game you wander around the world map, visiting towns and dungeons, and fighting monsters in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, much like in <em>Dragon Quest</em> games. You'll have two parties at your disposal, and will be able to switch between them at any time. One party is the Aquitallion, the \"main\" one, and the only one which can access plot-progressing areas. The other parties can be used for visiting dungeons and retrieving valuable items. At a certain point in the game, you'll also be able to build and manage your own town.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The game is set in the end of Edo period in Japan (1600-1868). Japan, controlled by the feudal rulers (shoguns) of the Tokugawa dynasty, consumed by a peaceful sleep for three hundred years, was awoken by the arrival of the Westerners. It seemed that they only wanted the end of Japan's isolation from the rest of the world. But their true purpose was to take control of a mysterious Japanese energy source called reiketsu. To protect those sources, that were running dry during their three hundred years-long reign, the Tokugawa Shoguns formed the famous Shinsengumi special force. In addition to its primary mission of clearing out forces that would try to overthrow the shogunate, there also existed a special branch of them called \"Shadow Shinsengumi\". The duty of the \"Shadow\" was to take care of \"those things the human hand cannot manage\"...</p>\n<p>You control Yamatomaru, a strong-willed sixteen-year-old boy who lives in Iida village, near Koufu. His father has recently passed away. After failing to defeat a monster in his village, he was saved by one of the Shadow Shinsengumi man, Mibu Juurota. As he receives his father's katana, he goes on his first mission - rescuing boys who were trapped in a mountain path. Soon the plot thickens and the young hero becomes involved in mystical struggles between the forces who try to control reiketsu...</p>\n<p>The gameplay is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dragon+Quest\">Dragon Quest </a> series and other Japanese-style RPGs: the battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. You fight using physical attacks and a variety of special moves based on spiritual energy. An unusual addition to the gameplay is the karma system. By doing good deeds you can increase your karma level, in an <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8812/ultima/\">Ultima</a>-like way. This way you get more money and precious items from fighting monsters, and your special powers increase in strength. If you don't show compassion, steal people's things and lie, your karma will decrease, you won't get money from random battles, and some people will attack you.</p>",

In this city lives a totally ordinary (at first) fourteen-year old girl Usagi. When she meets a magical cat named Luna, she finds out that she is in fact a princess sent to the future in order to fight the minions of Darkness. She discovers within herself the power to transform into the hero of darkness, Sailor Moon, meets other warriors who help her on her quest, and fights the evil Queen Beryl, hostile aliens, and other foes.</p>\n<p>The events of this game take place shortly after <em>Bish\u014djo Senshi Sailor Moon S</em>, the fourth volume of the long-running series. A global peace is established in the universe, but lately suspicious things are happening. A strange meteorite is seen approaching the Earth. Street gangs and spies who work for a mysterious person called Apsu are seen in Crystal Tokyo. And the Mystic Silver Crystal, the Ginzuishou, which protects the city, is shaking! Usagi and her friends must now investigate the strange events and face the forces of Darkness once again.</p>\n<p>The game is a Japanese-style RPG in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Final+Fantasy\">Final Fantasy</a> style (battles with your party to the right and the enemies to the left), with a battle system somewhat similar to that of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4501/chrono-trigger/\">Chrono Trigger</a>: you must form a party out of several available characters, make them participate in battles together, and learn powerful combo attacks.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This game is set in a fantasy world that resembles feudal Japan. Long time ago, the first deity, the Emperor of Light, created two gods - from the darkness, the Ocean God, and from the glittering moon, the Mountain Goddess - and sent them to build a world out of the chaos. The Ocean God poured rain over the chaos and created seas and oceans; the Mountain Goddess created the Earth. But the Ocean God became evil. He built a huge tower, which connected Earth and Heaven, and thus the world of men and the world of gods became merged, and the path for demons to invade the Earth was open.</p>\n<p>Somewhere on an island called Mamoshima, there lives a young warrior apprentice called Jin. One day he goes to the nearby village, but when he returns, he finds his house has been burnt down by demons, and his sister kidnapped. Remembering the tale of the Ocean God his sister told him when he was a child, Jin realizes he has to find a way to the tower of the Ocean God in order to free his sister. Together with Wokuu, a cute little creature who was human once and wishes to regain her true form, Jin begins the journey.</p>\n<p><em>Bushi Seiry\u016bden</em> is a RPG with an unusual combat system. Whenever player-controlled characters encounter a monster, the standard top-down perspective switches to side-scrolling, where the opponents attack each other. The battles are in real-time, but are divided into turns (calculated by the number of moves). Before each battle, a number appears on screen which indicates the maximum number of turns the player is encouraged to finish the battle within. If the player manages to stay below the maximum they receive special energy units called \"magatama\". Depending on the amount of magatama collected during the game, some scenes will change, and the endings will be different.</p>",

Naturally, it is his job to save this world and also to rescue the aforementioned woman, who has been kidnapped by the Shadow King.</p>\n<p><em>Young Merlin</em> is an action game with puzzle-solving elements. The hero has to fight enemies using spells that are gathered during the progress of the game, as well as solve puzzles, interact with the game's inhabitants, and use several objects. What sets this title apart from similar games is the fact that there is no text in the entire game; instead, icons are used to represent conversations. Furthermore, the game uses passwords instead of a battery to record the player's progress.</p>",

The demon lord, still in a form of a menacing dark cloud, started spawning monsters and sending them to attack the now helpless kingdom. The king called to the heavens for help.

        "description": "<p>The magic world of Wozz, populated by magicians, alchemists, and other kinds of people - including simple town and village inhabitants - was a seemingly peaceful place, until one day, a poisonous rain started turning its inhabitants into monsters. The chief wizard realizes that the demon Balaam is trying to link the world of Wozz with the world of humans. Only a human hero can stop Balaam, and the wizard's teleporting magic brings... three young humans: the Japanese girl Reona Kitazato, and two boys: the American Shot Phoenix and the Chinese Chun Chingtao. Will those youngsters be able to stop Balaam?</p>\n<p>The game is a traditional Japanese-style RPG similar to <em>Breath of Fire</em>: turn-based battles are viewed from an isometric perspective. You control all three characters as a party, but in the beginning of the game you choose one of them as the main character, and therefore will see the game from his/her perspective. In case the characters split up, you'll be able to control only the one you chose.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Following the events of the first <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/13786/cyber-knight/\">Cyber Knight</a> in the 24th century, the crew of the Swordfish have returned to Earth after defeating the mechanical \"Berzerkers\" far across space. However during their time away, the Earth Federation has been taken over by the ambitious General Forrest, who seeks to wage war on the independent systems and conquer them. Recognizing the potential weapons that could be made from the Berzerker science data, Forrest impounds the Swordfish and jails it's crew. The Berzerker data is used to create \"Overtech\" and bring to life \"Metalliforms\", self-replicating war machines. The Swordfish crew manages to escape, thanks to a mysterious agent \"CJ\", and are recruited into the resistance against the Earth Federation. Given a new spaceship, the Galvodirge, they must travel the galaxy to different human civilizations and devise a plan to stop Earth's attack.</p>\n<p><em>Cyber Knight II</em> is an RPG with science-fiction themes. As in the first game, much of the game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Galvodirge starship. The Galvodirge can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, the crew can debark either on foot or using combat modules (mechs). Some areas are only accessible using modules and others (such as towns) do not allow the use of these war machines. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated enemies leave behind \"NeoParts\", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. </p>\n<p>The crew are divided into a three person \"combat team\" and a three person \"support team\". If modules are used, they can be assigned from the ship's hanger. Unlike the first game, modules only perform a combat or a support role, and each is unique in statistics and the type of weaponry it can carry. When combat occurs on the main map, the support team will often deliver the first strike by firing missiles into the enemies. When searching facilities, caves or other locations, the support team is not available. Following either case, the combat team engages the enemy in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of \"options\" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Galvodirge.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The magical land of Shelldorado is populated by creatures who look like beasts, but possess a great wisdom despite their appearance. A long time ago, the land was attacked by the Demon King Fattobajah. The Demon King was only defeated by the power of the four great elemental shells - Fire Shell, Water Shell, Air Shell, and Earth Shell. In the ultimate battle, Fattobajah was sealed by the magical Aura Balls, and the Balls themselves were sealed in a crypt in Dorado City, so that the Demon King could never reawaken.</p>\n<p>Years have passed, and a disaster occurred. Several meteors  fell to earth, causing huge tidal waves. The Shell-beasts realize it must be another Aura Ball, one they have not sealed. They call the Hero of the Fire Shell back to Shelldorado. He must seal the new Aura Ball, but he can do that only after finding the other Shell heroes. The Hero of the Fire Shell is you...</p>\n<p>The game is a traditional Japanese-style RPG with random battles and turn-based combat, viewed from semi-third-person \"over-the-shoulder\" perspective. There are a lot of party members to recruit, the Shell heroes as well as optional, secret characters. The party members you find might have a unique skill which can be required to solve puzzles. At one point in the game, you'll also be able to build your own town.</p>\n<p>The player is once again embodying the Fire Shell Hero, a legendary champion of the friendly shell monsters, who is summoned to help the shell monsters defeat the evil sorcerer Dark. Dark has managed to locate six of the eggs of the Demon King, who was defeated in the previous game, and used his magics to hatch all six into formidable monster generals. He plans to use these monster generals and their armies to conquer the globe.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/436/dragon-warrior-dragon-quest-series/\">Dragon Quest series</a> and other turn-based RPGs.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Through the Light came the Darkness, and through the Darkness came the Light. They were inseparable in the beginning, and gave birth to each other. Rukyu appeared before all the other creatures, the great demon of darkness, later to be known as the Satan. The divine hero-god Roda went up to his dark realm to defeat him, but was struck down, and presumed dead. But the hero couldn't die so easily: he swore to defeat Rukyu once and for all. Meanwhile, Rukyu doesn't just stay in his realm, waiting for Roda: he goes out to the world as a death-bringing sorcerer, and he is out for Roda...</p>\n<p>The game is quite different from most other RPGs, because it lets you play as <em>both</em> the \"good\" hero and the villain. The game is divided into chapters, and each chapter is played by either Roda or Rukyu. You switch the two heroes chapter-after-chapter, and lead them to their ultimate battle from two opposite sides. The entire game, including the battles, is viewed from an isometric perspective. The battles are random and turn-based, and the battle field is divided into squares you can position and move your characters on. Both Roda and Rukyu can have party members join them, and both attack mostly with magic. Rukyu uses a special energy called \"Soul Power\", while Roda cast one-time spells from scrolls he receives after battles.</p>",

The two kingdoms could have lived in peace, but pride took over king Daruk, he didn't respect the Goddess any more, and as a result his mind became obsessed by the idea of destruction. Daruk attacked Reyfore, and for decades war was embracing the two kingdoms, setting the Earth in flames. After a prolonged battle, king Reynard defeated king Daruk, and a reign of prosperity began once again.</p>\n<p>But can evil be truly defeated? The hero of the game, a young adventurer, falls down from a cliff while taking a stroll near the ancient Sophia Temple. He is saved by an old man who lives with his daughter Refia in a small country house. But one day, a demonic-looking knight appears, accompanied by monsters, kills the old man, and kidnaps Refia. The old man recognized the knight - it was king Daruk! Now the hero must bring Refia back and defeat Daruk once and for all.</p>\n<p>The game has a less linear structure than a standard Japanese-style RPG: together with the main story there are many missions, or \"scenarios\", which are not obligatory to complete, but which occupy a large portion of the game. In the beginning of the game you create a party of four characters, the hero and his three companions. The battles are pre-determined and take place on the same screen as the gameworld itself. Your party and the enemies can move freely around the screen and attack with melee and ranged weapons, and their actions depend on the amount of action points they have. Navigation in town is menu-based.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The first of the two \"interactive fighters\" for SNES based on the famous manga series <em>Dragon Ball</em>. \"Totsugeki Hen\" tells the story of the hero, Son Goku, following the first volume of the manga. The boy Son Goku meets a mysterious girl named Bulma, and she sends him on a mission to obtain the magical Dragon Balls. Naturally, Bulma is not the only one needing those Balls, so that the young hero will soon have to face and defeat some bad guys, including his first true rival Piccolo.</p>\n<p>The game puts you in control of Son Goku only during battles or when there is a possibility to make a choice and to influence the storyline. There is no other gameplay in the game except fighting and picking answers from menu. The fights are one-on-one: you pause them by pressing the start button, and then program Son Goku, making him execute various moves: dash, kick, special attack, etc. Every attack can be countered by an enemy attack, and you have to follow the enemy's move pattern in order to attack and defend successfully.</p>",

The game picks up the story where it ended in the previous game, and continues through Piccolo, Saiyajin, and Freezer sagas of the manga. After the battle with the Demon King (Daimaou) Piccolo, the twenty-third World Martial Arts Tournament is about to begin. But to the amazement of the hero Son Goku and his friends, their archrival Piccolo appears during the tournament, so that it quickly turns into a genuine battle.</p>\n<p>You control Son Goku and his son Son Gohan, switching between them as the game progresses. The game is basically an interactive comic book in which you can influence the story by choosing to press a button when the game prompts you to make a choice. You'll also participate in battles. The battle system is similar to rock-paper-scissors game, where one kind of move always beats or always loses to another. You can dash into your enemies, attack physically, and perform special moves, pressing the buttons in real time (although the battles are divided into turns).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Super Saiya Densetsu</em> is based on the popular manga/anim\u00e9 series <em>Dragon Ball</em>. It follows the events described in the beginning of Dragon Ball Z, the second story block, which tells about the connection of the hero Son Goku with a powerful alien race, and new mighty foes from far away planets. The game starts just where the tale of Dragon Ball begins. Son Goku goes to meet his friends, but is stopped by a mysterious stranger named Raditz who tells Son Goku they are relatives. Raditz demands from him to destroy humanity, and as Son Goku refuses, takes his son Son Gohan hostage. To rescue his son, Son Goku joins forces with his arch-rival, the Demon King Piccolo, who obviously has his own plans concerning Raditz. And thus begins the story during which Son Goku will learn of his true origin...</p>\n<p>The game is a RPG similar to the card-based Dragon Ball Z RPGs for NES. During battles, you choose cards from your card inventory, which determine the nature and the strength of your characters' attacks. You can also train your characters in training houses and upgrade their special Ki power. Unlike early DBZ RPGs, you can move around freely in <em>Super Saiya Densetsu</em>, and your movements are not determined by cards. You can also fly around the world and use your special Dragon Radar to discover location of magical Dragon Balls.</p>",

There, he was found by people of Kardosa Empire, who soon understood they have in their hands a human who possesses the secret of a superior ancient technology, that was unknown to the primitive civilization of the present...</p>\n<p>You play the role of Aleth, the son of the High Priest in the small kingdom of Garade, whom leads a peaceful life with his friend Lagnus, Prince of Garade. One day Aleth accidentally gains possession of a precious artifact which is sought after by the Kardosa Empire. Aleth and Lagnus get involve in a conflict which will soon lead them to great discoveries of the secrets of the ancient civilization, of the great destruction that occurred thousand years ago, and of their own true identities...</p>\n<p>The game is a Japanese-style RPG: your party meets randomly encountered enemies and bosses, and fights them in turn-based combat viewed from isometric perspective. You upgrade armor by buying it, and also can buy weapons, but weapons can also be upgraded for money to different levels, to create powerful attacks called \"techs\".</p>",

At first, the town's inhabitants didn't pay attention to the meteors. But then, strange things started happening. Monsters attacked people, and left on the victims' bodies a mysterious crest with one word: <em>demiseed</em>. One day you, a young boy who lives in the town, are contacted by two aliens who came in a miniature space ship. One of the aliens introduces himself as Zero, the Space Sheriff, and explains that an intergalactic criminal named Demi has escaped from justice and is hiding somewhere on the island, being the cause of all the troubles lately. Zero then possesses your body, lends you his powers, and commands you on the quest to destroy Demi and to bring peace to your island and to the alien world alike!</p>\n<p><em>Ganpuru: Gunman's Proof</em> is an action game with light RPG elements (buying and upgrading weapons, etc.) set in Wild West. While featuring traditional dungeon-crawling and many enemies to dispose of in real time combat, the game doesn't equip you with standard medieval swords, but with pistols, shotgun, machine gun, and even a flamethrower. Your weapons have infinite ammo. You can duck to avoid the alien monsters' fire, and perform special attacks with various types of weapons.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Holy Umbrella</em> you control a schoolboy who lives in modern-day Japan. One day, the sky suddenly turns dark blue, a heavy rain falls onto the city, and the boy finds, halfway between his house and the school, an umbrella which seems to have fallen from the sky. What he does not know is that the umbrella is magical! The moment he touches it, he is transferred to a parallel universe. Immediately, he is attacked by a huge tank, but a strange old man with a talking bird saves him. It seems that an evil creature named Dondera is threatening the country with the terrible monsters she created. But is it really so? You visit the capital town, talk to the emperor, and decide to investigate the matter...</p>\n<p><em>Holy Umbrella</em> is essentially a platform action game, but unlike most other games of this genre, it allows you to visit towns, where you control your hero in a standard RPG-like top-down fashion. You can enter houses, talk to townspeople, etc. On platform levels, which are the main part of the game, you have to switch between the hero, the talking bird Bonto who accompanies you on your quest, and the girl Saki, whom you meet later in the game. Every character has his/her own special abilities and own ways of fighting: the hero can slide through air by using the umbrella, Bonto can double-jump on high ledges, Saki can jump on walls, etc. You use your umbrella as a weapon, as well as elemental stones you can collect on your way and throw at enemies. You also find various power-ups and items you can equip on the hero.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ryu Knight</em> is based on an anime series of the same name. The story of the game is simple: you are Adyu, an apprentice knight who spends all his time training. One day, a mysterious old man appears out of nowhere, approaches Adyu and tells him the world needs more paladins, and therefore you must train harder in order to become one. He sends you on a quest to find a legendary weapon, which is broken into twelve parts, each part being hidden in a different place. He also entrusts you with the power of Ryu, a huge magical armor that grants the hero who equips it immense power. This is where Adyu's journey begins!</p>\n<p>The game is an action RPG, somewhat similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/1497/ys-series/\">Ys series</a>. Adyu wanders through the world and fights enemies in real-time combat, using melee weapons. He can also jump to avoid enemy attacks. You gain experience after defeating monsters and advance in levels. You can summon the armor Ryu at any time, which makes you much stronger, but you can't go through narrow corridors and climb up stairs when in Ryu form. The game features mostly open areas populated by enemies with an occasional town thrown in. The structure of the game is non-linear: you can visit almost any area of the map at any time.</p>",

Gulliver's father was apparently connected to the secret of the Crystals, and was mercilessly killed by Judou. Now Gulliver swears revenge and embarks, together with Misty and Edison, on a grand journey that will take him to several cities and countries all over the world, from Rome to Himalaya.</p>\n<p>The game is an action RPG in which you can switch characters.

        "description": "<p>The town Newcam, Massachusetts, 1924. On the outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...</p>\n<p><em>Laplace no Ma</em> (Devil of Laplace) is a Japanese-style RPG with horror elements, somewhat similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/13590/sweet-home/\">Sweet Home</a> for NES. Unlike <em>Sweet Home</em>, this game is more oriented towards RPG gameplay. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc. The battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. The hero of the game can recruit three other characters to the party of five available. Each character (including the hero, to whom you assign gender and class) belongs to one of the five character classes: Dilettante, Medium, Detective, Scientist, or Journalist. Dilettante is an all-around character with defensive magic, Medium is a kind of a black mage, Detective is a melee fighter, Scientist can construct powerful machines to perform various techniques, and the Journalist can take pictures of the monsters, which is the only way to gain money in the game.</p>",

Wherever she appears, destruction follows. Lady's parents, afraid of their daughter's hyperactive nature, locked her in a mansion guarded by two loyal servants: the gardener Yoshio and the cook Cox. One day, Lady finds a book about Deathland Island, where a great treasure is supposedly hidden. She escapes the mansion, arrives at Deathland Island, and learns its was once ruled by a mad scientist King Baron, who made experiments on monsters. Lady decides to explore Baron's castle and the rest of the island, to find a way to get to the legendary treasure.</p>\n<p><em>Lady Stalker</em> is an action game with puzzle-solving and light role-playing elements, closely connected to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Landstalker:+treasure+of+king+nole\">Landstalker</a>. The player explores dungeons and other locations, most of which are full of various puzzles. Lady cannot jump, but instead dashes to cross small pits. Regular battle encounters are random. Once Lady enters a battle, she must defeat her foes in action-style combat before being able to continue exploration. Later in the game other characters fight alongside her. Those characters are controlled by the AI, but the player can pause the battle at any time and assign commands to them.</p>",

He just turned sixteen, and on the day of his initiation he receives a task from the Great Magician Fehbennels: he has to go to a nearby cave and to retrieve a precious gem. When Kurt returns home, he meets an injured soldier from the Silver Castle. He says the castle was attacked by the army of the evil warlock Glud. The Great Magician Fehbennels sends Kurt to king Gustaf and the ruler of the Silver Castle, Lord Yuri. Kurt gets involved in a conflict between different nations, and meets the elven girl Mei and other companions on his quest to defeat the ultimate evil.</p>\n<p>The game is a Japanese-style RPG: you navigate Kurt and his party on the world map, visiting towns, descending into dungeons, and fighting random enemies and bosses. The battles are set in auto-mode and are a mixture of turn-based and real time styles. You can stop the flow of a battle by accessing a menu and assigning commands to your characters. The battles are viewed from a third-person perspective, and the characters move around the battle field automatically while performing their attacks. The characters can use physical attacks and a variety of offensive and defensive magic.</p>",

The game is set in a world of Andell - a floating continent where ancient prophecies and highly advanced technology co-exist. A curse has fallen onto Andell - its four island, once united, are now separated, and are floating away from the heart of the continent, the temple of Andell. The sages of the temple summon a great hero named Farse, who must find a special magic orb for each one of the islands, which is the only way to re-unite them. Farse embarks on his journey, aided by three Terranos, the big-eared inhabitants of Andell.</p>\n<p>This is a Japanese-style RPG where you control a party containing the main hero Farse and three Terranos you select out of the available five. You encounter random enemies and bosses and fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. You can use special attacks and magical spells, which don't consume magic points, but take away a certain amount of your hit points. Instead of healing items, you have mini-bottles you can refill with potions in special places in towns. You can equip various magical artifacts which will allow you to use magic spells belonging to eight different elements.</p>",

Loosely connected to Buddhist and local Japanese myths, it tells the story of Madara, the son of the evil Emperor Miroku. An ancient prophecy said that a young warrior with tremendous powers will dethrone Miroku, and for fear of his son's might he ordered to cut his body into eight pieces. Raised with artificial limbs, Madara soon discovered his true origin and understood he was destined to bring down his father. </p>\n<p>The game puts you in the role of a teenager named Kamishiro, who lives in modern-day Japan. One day he and his girlfriend Subaru venture into a mysterious shrine on the outskirts of their home town, and Kamishiro met the princess Sakuya, who explained to him that he must travel to a different world and to help Madara to get rid of Miroku. During his travels Kamishiro meets many characters from the original manga story, including Madara's brother and rival, Kage-Ou, and discovers the secret connection between the two worlds.</p>\n<p>The game is a Japanese-style RPG with random battles. The combat system is turn-based, but the battles are set in auto mode, and you must pause them in order to assign commands to your characters. The battles are viewed from a dynamic third-person perspective, and the characters move around the battle field when executing their attacks. You can also change formation of your party, and use a variety of magic spells.</p>",

Unlike <em>Puyo Puyo</em>, <em>Mad\u014d Monogatari</em> is a Japanese-style RPG. You play Arle, a five-year old apprentice magician. She is attending a special kindergarten, and it is time for the Final Exam. At the same time, Arle receives a mysterious letter that tells her that if she finds eight magical gems and takes them to the Wizard Mountain, she'll be granted one wish. Arle decides to search for the gems which are scattered all over the world, and to overcome all the obstacles with her great magic power!</p>\n<p>The game features random enemy encounters and turn-based combat, which takes place on a side-view screen (Arle to the left, the enemies to the right). You can't perform physical attacks at all, and your only way of harming enemies is through magic. During the game, you learn a variety of magic spells, which can be upgraded later. In battles you can't see your own and the enemies' hit points, and have to act according to your intuition.</p>",

The game's main view is an overhead map of a specific location, such as a town, where the characters move and can interact with NPCs. Upon leaving an area, the view changes to a larger overworld map showing locations of interest. The battles are viewed from an isometric perspective and the characters automatically engage and perform their actions. While the player does not directly control any of the characters, they can pause the battle at time and assign new strategies (such as melee, use long-ranged attacks or use Magic) to each character. Experience points and gold are awarded after each battle, the later of which can be used to purchase equipment and items.</p>",

The hero's first objective is to find a way to his home district Shinjuku, where he will obtain more information about the power that threatens Japan, and discover mysterious artifacts from an unknown civilization, called <em>ooparts</em> (out-of-place artifacts).</p>\n<p>You can play as either one of the five characters presented to you in the beginning of the game: Rage, Rai, Hokuto, Seigi, and Daigo, each one having his own initial strengths and weaknesses. The entire game plays from first-person perspective. You navigate a cursor over the city map and check out your radar device to find out places of interest. The claustrophobic, extremely complex first-person 3D dungeons have a distinct <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em> flair. The battles are random and turn-based. Your main character doesn't gain levels, but instead accumulates energy points which can be then distributed freely to raise his strength, mental power, defense, etc. Certain characters join your party later in the game, and there are also friendly demons who would join you if you choose a correct way of behavior when you encounter them.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The hero of the game is Fron, a sixteen-year old boy who lives on the island of Monstania. One day, strolling in the forest, he notices a strange light. The light lead him to a clearing, and then suddenly disappeared. But Fron realized what was the meaning of that light - it was a fairy! Of course, everybody knew that fairies had been long extinct, but Fron never believed in that. All his life he wanted to meet a real fairy, and now, when the opportunity has come, he firmly decides to find her. His girlfriend Tia helps him on the dangerous journey, during which they meet a mysterious little girl named Chitta, and get involved in a grand adventure, that will ultimately lead them to the battle against the dark force that threatens the whole Monstania!</p>\n<p><em>Monstania</em> has a somewhat unusual gameplay within the frames of Japanese RPGs. You don't explore the world in the game: it is entirely linear and takes you to the next destination by itself (only at a few points you can choose where to go next by selecting an appropriate answer). Once within the location, you cannot leave it until you complete all your objectives there, which then take you to the next location. The objective is usually a large strategic battle. You navigate your party members on the battle field, attack with melee and long-ranged weapons, and use special technique which require action points. Unlike most other turn-based strategy games, an enemy makes a move immediately after you did the same with one of your characters, without waiting for the \"enemy turn\". The RPG element is not very significant: your characters level up automatically after each battle. There are also some puzzles to solve in certain locations.</p>",

His only wish is to surpass his father and to show him he has become a better fighter than him. Laila is a cheerful treasure hunter. She dreams only of valuable things, adventure, travels, and life in the capital city. Gaou is experiencing a personal tragedy: he wants to discover the mystery of the disappearance of a woman he loved, Asuka, aided by his best friend Froz. Naaga is a girl who wears a heavy armor, which - as she thinks - will prevent her from losing any battle. At present, she has problems since she owes a million gold pieces to her guild. What do those heroes have in common? As their ways cross, they will find out they are in fact pursuing one and the same goal...</p>\n<p><em>Burning Heroes</em> lets you start as either one of the four characters. Each one starts in a different place and is seemingly absorbed in his/her personal quest, but as the game progresses, the four heroes meet each other. You should also find and \"unlock\" four other playable characters as you advance in the game. The gameplay system is similar to other Japanese-style RPGs: you fight random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat, viewed from third-person perspective, like in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Final+Fantasy\"> Final Fantasy</a> games. As you get hit in a battle, your \"passion\" (literally \"hot blood\", <em>nekketsu</em> in Japanese) level rises, and the more damage you take, the quicker you reach 100%. Once the passion bar is full, you can summon a powerful monster and to unleash a devastating attack on the entire enemy party.</p>",

Traveling in faraway lands, Duke heard that his homeland was under attack. He decided to return to Neugier. On the way his ship was attacked by pirates, lead by a mysterious demon named Ord. After he barely escaped the ship, Duke found his way into his father's castle. He realized now that the pirates' attack and the monsters roaming the castle are connected. Although his father doesn't trust him, Duke is determined to save Neugier.</p>\n<p><em>Neugier</em> is an action game in which Duke fights enemies by slashing them with his melee weapons. He also has a \"throw chain\" ability, which allows him to press objects to the walls, destroying them, or push enemies to the walls the same way. Duke can also jump and equip armor that can be found in the dungeons.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The game is based on the anim\u00e9 series <em>Ranma 1/2</em>. It tells the story of the young martial artist Ranma Saotome. Traveling with his father Genma across China, Ranma discovered a cursed spring. When he and his father fell into that spring, they were both transformed: Ranma into a little girl, Genma into a panda bear. Hot water restored them to their original appearance, but whenever they are splashed with cold water, they turn into their \"cursed\" forms. </p>\n<p>The story of the game begins as Ranma and Genma are having breakfast by their friends. Suddenly, several cat-like creatures burst in and kidnap Genma. Ranma finds out that the cats belonged to Akaneko (Crimson Cat) Gang, who kidnaps strong fighters for some reason. Soon Ranma discovers that Kamusaru, the leader of the Crimson Cat Gang, is looking for an ancient treasure that will allow him to turn into a Nekomaou (Cat Demon King), and take over the world. Ranma and his friends will do anything to rescue Genma and to stop Kamusaru's evil plans!</p>\n<p>The game features many characters from the anim\u00e9, including Ranma's fiancee Akane, the fighter Ryouga, the amazon warrior Shampoo who is in love with Ranma, and others. The game is built like a traditional Japanese RPG: your party fights random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a third-person, Final Fantasy-like perspective. In battles, you can attack physically, or use various offensive and defensive techniques, which consume \"ki\" (an equivalent of magic points). Not only Ranma and Genma, but also the other characters in your parties can take a different shape. You carry around a bucket of cold water, and every time you use it on one of your characters, he/she is transformed into a \"cursed\" form. This is sometimes required to advance the story of the game (for example, Ranma can enter a certain location only as a girl).</p>",

        "description": "<p>This game is quite different from the first two <em>Aretha</em> games on SNES. <em>Rejoice</em> is a semi-serious, semi-comical RPG that is only loosely connected to other Aretha games. The heroes of the game are four thieves who live in a small village, occasionally robbing people, and exploring ancient ruins in search for treasure. One day, a terrible flood drove the village inhabitants out of their houses, and one of the thieves, Treno, was washed away to a sea shore, near a forest. There, a mysterious old wizard found Treno, and the two ventured into the forest to find the way back home. As the plot thickens, the heroes discover that none else but the Demon King Howard is plotting an evil scheme, and they are the only ones who can stop him!</p>\n<p>Unlike other <em>Aretha</em> games, <em>Rejoice</em> is not a turn-based, but an action RPG. Monsters roam the game world, and you fight them by using weapons with elemental charges. You can pause the game at any time, access the menu, use items, and also switch characters. You can also jump, although this ability is not an integral part of the gameplay. You visit towns and can buy weapons, armor, and items in stores.</p>",

Proud of the warrior traditions of their family, Borgan sends Arm to retrieve a powerful sword from the depths of the dungeon Arff. When Arm returns home, he finds the village attacked by soldiers from as hostile empire. His father loses his memory, and he has to find a magical herb to cure him. The king of Rondium and his court magician send Arm and Linda on a quest to find out more about the attack, and Arm discovers the secrets of the ancient Mediom empire and its evil emperor.</p>\n<p>This is an action RPG in which you control Arm and his party. You can either let the computer AI handle the actions of the other characters, or control them on your own, one at a time. In battles, characters have their own attacks: Arm uses physical attacks, Linda casts magic, etc. The dungeons are complex, and many of them have puzzles that you can solve by making two characters co-operate.</p>",

Ten years ago, the elder of the village Ryuen found you, a little child, near the village gate. Nobody knew where you came from, but in your hands you were holding an egg. This egg was carefully preserved, and now, after ten years, a dragon has hatched from it - a white dragon who can talk! It became clear that you are one of the legendary Dragonriders. Now the Elder has a new task for you. The Dragonrider Amrita, who has been taking good care of you during those ten years, has betrayed the Guild, set the Guild's warehouse on fire, and fled Ryuen with her dragon. It is your mission to locate her, to bring her back, and to find out why she disappeared.</p>\n<p>You travel to eight different worlds, learning more about the legendary race of dragons and their dragonriders. You can recruit dragons to your party. Each dragon has a unique ability - one can swim, another one can use magic, etc. The regular enemies are random, and you fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective.When you defeat a monster, you have a choice of either feeding your dragon with it (it restores the dragons' hit points), or carrying it with you and then selling it in a town. Your weapons can wear off if you use them a lot. At some point you can also buy pigs and then cook them to produce healing items.</p>",

Swat Kats is essentially a side-scrolling action game. You start off using T-Bone and Razor and guide them through 5 different worlds of action packed excitement. Game levels are based on different episodes of the show. As you progress through the game you can increase your weapon levels and gain new weapons. Mode 7 graphics are featured in some parts of the game. A unique feature to the game is the ability to start on different levels.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the movie by the same name, <em>An American Tail: Fievel Goes West</em> is a platform game featuring the young mouse Fievel Mousekewitz. After immigrating to overseas to America in the beginning of the 20th century, the Mousekewitz family has moved out onto the open frontier of the wild west. With dreams of being a cowboy, Fievel soon makes friends and plays on the dusty streets imagining himself a great gunslinger. But all is not well as the villainous Cat R. Waul and his gang of cats (as well as other creatures) has plans to turn this place into an all-you-can-eat mouse buffet. It's up to Fievel to get in the way of Cat's plans with the help of the canine sheriff, Wylie Burp and his non-mouse eating cat pal, Tiger</p>\n<p>The game is a traditional action platformer. Fievel can jump and fire a pop-gun as he ventures through each level, collecting coins. The pop-gun can be powered-up to fire more powerful projectiles.</p>",

Equipped not only with your best weapon and armor, but also with your manly charm, you have to go out to the jungle of modern city, to get Yuka back! I guess it also won't harm if you get acquainted with some pretty ladies on the way, now will it?..</p>\n<p><em>Love Quest</em> is a humorous RPG where traditional turn-based, first person perspective combat options are replaced by actions you would normally do to win a girl's attention: you can for example smile, which will cost you MP and inflict big \"damage\" on the girl, and so on. Your only enemies are girls (including random encounters), and your progress is determined by your successful fighting. Of course, you also level up, acquire items, better weapons and armor, just like in any \"normal\" RPG. At certain points girls will also join your party, to heal and to support you. Despite its \"suggestive\" themes, the game doesn't feature any explicit sex scenes or nudity.</p>",

        "description": "<p>There was once a great scientist and inventor named Gepetto, who lived on an island farm together with his creations, his robotic helper, the pixie Tinker, and his pet animals. His greatest creation was an artificial boy named Pino. No, he was not carved from wood, but looked just like a real boy - only he could turn his head 360 degrees. But Gepetto was arrested for an unknown reason. The boy Pino looks like a real boy, but he was completed just a few moments ago, and he knows absolutely nothing. All he can do is wander aimlessly, poking objects and turning his head. It is up to the player to make Pino a real man!</p>\n<p><em>Wonder Project J: Kikai no Sh\u014dnen Pino</em> is a simulation game with role-playing elements. The player must use the robotic pixie Tinker to educate Pino. It is possible to move Tinker around, examining objects and collecting them in an adventure-like fashion. Pino will automatically follow her to the direction she is facing, but will continue walking until the player stops him. He will also pick objects and make his own \"experiments\" with them. The goal is to train Pino in various disciplines. His stats can be raised in a RPG style: reading books increases his intelligence, throwing a ball increases his dexterity, and so on. By praising or scolding Pino, the player will gradually make him understand what should be done and what shouldn't.</p>",

Five different variations of the circuit are featured, each one progressively more difficult. 250cc, 400cc and 750cc bikes are featured, each one available to be best for top speed, acceleration or handling. The bikes have two steering methods - leaning into the corner or tilting in with the bike upright -the options allow you to set which of these is controlled on the pad and which use the L and R buttons. Races can be set to last for between 15 minutes and the full 8 hours. Your ultimate aim is to win every type of race, across all bikes and circuit layouts.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Momotar\u014d is a boy who was found by an old couple in a giant peach, according to an old Japanese folk tale. When he grew up, he defeated the evil demons from the Demon Island, and three years later found a way to save his land from the wrath of Emma, the King of Hell. But a new threat has appeared now! The demonic king Basara sends his henchman Karura to the moon, to kidnap Kaguya-hime, the legendary Moon Princess, in order for her to marry his son, Prince Daida. Momotar\u014d prepares his magic carriage and flies to the moon, attempting to rescue Kaguya-hime. But he doesn't suspect how strong his foes really are...</p>\n<p>The sequel to the first two <em>Momotar\u014d Densetsu</em> games is very similar to its predecessors in terms of gameplay. Moving around Momotar\u014d and his party members over the world map (which has become 3D by now), you visit towns, buy weapons and accessories, talk to people, and fight random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat viewed from first person perspective.</p>",

Rex must be asking himself, \"My parents put a mortgage on their house to put me through eight years of medical school just so I could scrub tar off someone's lungs like a window-washer?\" But it gets worse: Big Tobacco, pre-emptively attempting to silence the turnabout whistleblowing revelation they anticipate in the unlikely event of this salesman's recovery, have some shrinking technology of their own, and have introduced sinister nanobots into his body to ensure his -- and Rex's -- untimely demises.</p>\n<p>Washing off goo and attempting to survive the robot sprites' poor collision-detection routines comprise the large part of this game (albeit in exotic, well-rendered environments such as The Mouth, The Heart, The Lungs, and eventually The Brain -- where you struggle to clean up regenerating blobs of nicotine addiction); sporadically you also encounter mines which grill you on smoking-related health facts and myths, rewarding correct answers and blowing up when presented with falsehoods. Though the majority of the game plays like a 2D platform shooter, there are also over-the-shoulder 1st-person inter-level sequences where you pilot a futuristic vessel through bronchial tubes and blood vessels like something out of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1434/space-harrier/\">Space Harrier</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tempest\">Tempest</a> -- only with more globs of diseased sputum zooming straight toward you.</p>",

Luna, a magical talking cat, contacts her and tells her she is in fact a Sailor Moon, one of the legendary Pretty Fighters - girls who fight the forces of darkness and protect the Kingdom of Moon. </p>\n<p>The game is based on the events of the anim\u00e9 that follow the victory of Usagi and her friends over the Queen Beryl. Peace has returned to the Moon Kingdom. But suddenly, a little girl named Chibiusa arrives from the future and says the future kingdom is threatened by the forces of the evil Prince Diamond. Looks like you are the only ones who can defeat him, and save the future Sailor Moon, Chibiusa's mother.</p>\n<p>This is a beat-'em up game. You can play as either Usagi or any of her girlfriends, including Chibiusa. You move on a platform and fight the enemies by punching, kicking, and throwing them, and by using special abilities unique to each character. You can advance only after you have cleared an area from enemies.</p>",

Bonkers is a bob-cat police officer who lives in \"toondom\", a cartoony land where people co-exist with various creatures from cartoon movies. </p>\n<p>One day, Bonkers and his partner Lucky hear about a shocking robbery: Hollywood's most valuable treasures - Sorcerer's Hat, Mermaid's Voice, and Magic Lamp - were stolen! Now it is up to Bonkers to capture the thieves and to take back the stolen treasures.</p>\n<p>This is an action platform game. Bonkers can jump and dash, throwing enemies aside and even destroying some obstacles. Enemies can be killed by jumping on their heads. You can also collect various items such as bombs to throw at the enemies, cakes to refill your health, or hyper juice to make you dash continuously.</p>\n<p>Besides the common license, this game is totally different from the Genesis game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/16906/bonkers/\"> Bonkers</a>.</p>",

The Metal Warriors are mecha pilots whose goal is to defend the planet and eventually expel the enemies. At first, they need to complete a few rescue and intelligence-gathering missions in space before the government can clear the path for a return to Earth and an assault on enemy bases.</p>\n<p><em>Metal Warriors</em> is a battlemech action game with platforming elements, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/11879/cybernator/\">Cybernator</a> in concept. The game's distinctive feature is the ability to pilot six different mechs, which vary considerably in gameplay style. Each of these mechs is equipped with its own melee weapons, firearms, and shields. Most of the mechs can only walk, but one of them is able to fly while the other rolls. </p>\n<p>The player character can leave the mech and explore the stages on foot, and also change mechs in the middle of the exploration. Power-ups can be found in special containers and include weapon upgrades (up to four levels), bouncing and heat-seeking shots, as well as heavy shoulder weapons such as a grenade launcher. </p>\n<p>Beside the single-player mode, the game also includes a two-player versus mode, in which two players try to exploit the strengths of the various mech types and their equipment to defeat each other in combat.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The game is based on the anime series \"Doraemon\". Doraemon is a blue robotic cat who has the ability to enter dream world and to help the people who live there. In this game, Nobita, a bespectacled friend of Doraemon's, suddenly meets a little fairy. Long ago, humans and fairies lived together in peace, but since the humans started developing their technology, the fairies have no place any more. Nobita and Doraemon travel to the dream world to find out how can they help.</p>\n<p>The game primarily consists of platform action stages, with an exploration mode thrown in. In this mode, you navigate Doraemon from a top-down view, talking to people and entering houses. When you have gathered enough information, a place on the map will be highlighted. If Doraemon (or other characters, later in the game) enters this place, a platform action section begins. In platform mode, Doraemon must overcome the obstacles and defeat enemies by jumping on them or by throwing magic dusk at them, in order to retrieve important items.</p>",

It is based on the manga \"Doraemon\", that tells the story of a Japanese boy named Nobita, who always gets bullied by stronger kids in the school. In the future, his grandson uses a time machine and send the cat-like robot Doraemon to protect Nobita. In this adventure, Nobita, Doraemon, and their friends travel to the Toys Land. Some evil toys are threatening this country, and it's up to our heroes to help its inhabitants.</p>\n<p>The game is primarily dedicated to platform action, with an exploration mode during which Doraemon walks around towns, talking to people and entering houses. Key locations lead to platform levels, which must be completed to advance the story. Platform levels include plenty of obstacles (pits, spikes, self-destructing platforms etc.), as well as various enemies who try to stop the heroes. You can choose one of the six available characters to play through the platform level. They all can jump and defeat enemies either by jumping on their heads or by using long-ranged weapons.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The game is based on the popular manga series <em>Doraemon</em>. Doraemon is a blue cat robot who came from the future to protect a Japanese boy named Nobita. Nobita always gets himself in all kinds of troubles, so his grandson in the future decided to help him by sending Doraemon to keep an eye on him. One day, Nobita and Doraemon are looking at the beautiful moon, when suddenly a strange light engulfs them. They learn that something terrible has happened in the Moon Kingdom. Now they must travel to the moon and discover what is going on.</p>\n<p>This is a platform action game that is somewhat similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Super+Mario+World\"> Super Mario World</a>. You travel on a world map and enter various platform locations. Before each level, you can choose to play as either Doraemon, Nobita, or other four available characters. You can jump on enemies' heads or shoot at them with various weapons to eliminate them. There are many items and upgrades scattered around the levels, and sometimes it is possible to power-up by using two characters simultaneously.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Josephine is a teenage girl who is currently attending <em>Honest Osaki's Kendo School and Used Car Sales</em> to learn Kendo swordsmanship. The old man Osaki teaches his students the art of psychic powers so they can better defeat the forces of evildoers. Josephine is given the Zopikki Talisman; a powerful artifact which transforms Josephine's normal self into a battle warrior. Gripping the bamboo sword and focusing her psychic powers, Josephine must defeat ghosts, pandas and all kinds of other strange creatures which look to cause trouble.</p>\n<p>In <em>Kendo Rage</em>, the player takes control of Josephine. She can move left and right, jump, duck and attack with her bamboo sword. Josephine's psychic powers are shown on a bar and recharge gradually at a steady pace, changing color as they do. Depending on the color, an attack done will use up the current psychic energy and let loose a stronger attack, usually a projectile. Additionally, Josephine can summon flames around herself during a rush attack, at the cost of some energy. The game lasts seven levels, with a boss finishing off each level.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Two of the most popular puzzle games return, but now together in an exclusive compilation for SNES. The games have a slight graphical update when compared with the original Game Boy and NES games, but the gameplay remains totally faithful to the games released for both platforms.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tetris:+The+Soviet+Challenge\">Tetris</a>, the main objective is to pile blocks that will fall down continuously, in order to create a row or \"line\" without spaces. For this collection, the game comes with two bonus options: 2 PLAYER GAME (absent in the NES version) and VS. COM (absent in both versions), with 3 CPU opponents available, each one representing a difficulty level (EASY, MEDIUM, and HARD, respectively).</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6116/dr-mario/\">Dr. Mario</a>, the objective is to eliminate all the viruses contained in a big bottle. Dr. Mario (situated in the upper-right side of the screen) will throw capsules with 6 different color combinations (Red-Red, Red-Blue, Yellow-Yellow, Red-Yellow, Blue-Blue and Blue-Yellow) in order to line up at least four viruses or capsules of the same color horizontally or vertically and to make them disappear. In this compilation, the game comes with a bonus option: VS. COM, where you'll face the CPU players: Blue Virus (EASY), Yellow Virus (MEDIUM), and Red Virus (HARD).</p>\n<p>For competitive players in both games, there is Mixed Match, where you and a friend can play Tetris and Dr. Mario like a tournament! Adjust the handicap levels, play time, music, and other settings to balance your different skills. The game order is: TETRIS B-TYPE (clear a certain amount of lines), DR. MARIO (disinfect a predetermined number of viruses) and TETRIS A-TYPE (clear lines until the time expires). At the end of the time limit, the player with the highest score is the winner.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A long time ago the kingdoms of wind, fire, earth and water\ncompeted for the Trialight, a weapon created by the Arch Mage Wylde that can only be used by a Firestriker. The kingdom of wind won and united the four kingdoms. Wylde however, was not satisfied with peace and conjured four monsters to overthrow the united world. Now, only the kingdom of wind remains and the player takes control over the last Firestriker to free the other kingdoms and defeat the monsters.</p>\n<p>Even though Firestriker looks like a typical SNES RPG, it is in fact an action game that has more in common with a pinball-game than with any other genre. The Trialight is a ball of fire that basically behaves like a pinball. The player controls the Firestriker who can freely walk across the screen and strike at the Trialight to control its movement. Levels are filled with obstacles, destroyable block and monsters. Monsters and blocks can only be destroyed by the Trialight. The goal of each level is to maneuver the Trialight towards the exit of the screen. The exit is usually blocked by destroyable obstacles and sometimes certain conditions (such as killing all monsters or destroying certain objects) have to be fulfilled before a level can be completed. If the Firestriker is killed or the Trialight falls off the screen, the player loses a life. Additionally to the Firestriker, the player can use the shoulder buttons to control a magician who (in single player mode) stays at the bottom of the screen. The levels consist of several screens and are entered from a world map. As the game progresses, the player will also fight several bosses and free other Firestrikers whose special abilities are necessary to complete the game.</p>\n<p>Firestriker also features a two-player cooperative mode as well as a duel-mode for up to four players.</p>",

The player takes control of Frodo Baggins, who must find companions for his quest. The game's locations, individual objectives, missions, and quests are structured quite differently from those of the computer release. Most of the quests involve retrieving items for various NPCs, thus advancing the narrative.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is also different from the computer version, being less heavy on character development (role-playing), and more oriented towards combat, which is action-based in this release. Though up to three characters join Frodo on his quest, one player can control only one character at a time. Multiplayer has been therefore added to the game, with up to four players controlling the characters in the party simultaneously.</p>\n<p>The game cartridge does not contain any RAM/battery; games can only be saved by remembering a code. The code must later be entered into the game to continue.</p>",

Many of its crew and its 2300 passengers will be killed outright in the initial overturning; in the transfigured catastrophic ship environment, most of the remainder will be unable to locate, reach and secure a safe exit from the sinking ship before it floods entirely. </p>\n<p>Inspired by Paul Gallico's 1969 novel <em>The Poseidon Adventure</em>, this game puts the player in the shoes of one of four denizens of the fated vessel: Capris Wisher, architect; Redwin Gardener, counselor; Luke Haines, sailor; or Jeffrey Howell, doctor. Each of these gentlemen possess certain exclusive skills and distinct backstories and motivations - a successful strategy toward winning the game will vary greatly depending on which character the player initially selects to control.</p>\n<p>The goal is not to be on the ship when it goes down for the last time. Accomplishing this demands mastery of a new skill hitherto untapped by its platform-game spiritual predecessors <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Prince+of+Persia\">Prince of Persia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/555/flashback-the-quest-for-identity/\">Flashback</a>: exploring and navigating the ship in both an upright and an upside-down position, as well as many of the gradiated permutations between - thanks to dizzying Mode 7 abuse, the game environment will tip, tilt and skew at predictable intervals, granting access to some previously unreachable areas while denying access to other portions of the ship the player perhaps intended to go back through.</p>\n<p>A successful evacuation is going to require the assistance of other survivors. Supposing the player can find and reach them, it will still be necessary to safely lead them past obstacles and hazards; as with most NPCs, they're slower and less agile than the protagonist, necessitating plotting out the simplest, safest course possible, given the circumstances. The game's ending is determined by which and how many people the player managed to rescue.</p>\n<p>The game must be completed within a time limit of one hour. Since injury in this dangerous and unpredictable environment is so frequent and, indeed, inevitable, death has been replaced by a deduction of five minutes from the time remaining; but no matter how safe the protagonist may find himself after one hour of game time, when the countdown reaches zero, it's game over.</p>",

The game consists of six stages, and in each, you are given a series of missions to complete that include rescuing prisoners; repairing pipes, fuses, and junction boxes; welding doors shut; and destroying alien eggs, as well as the mother alien. Once you have accomplished all missions in a stage, you move on to the next stage where you will receive new mission objectives. Missions are outlined via a terminal, and a series of blueprints help you navigate your way through the complex.</p>\n<p>Making your job difficult are several types of aliens, which can be killed by using pulse rifles, grenade launchers, and flamethrowers (which comes in three flavors). Med-kits can be picked up that will increase your health.</p>",

Using this ability he has taken over the military forces and now appears unstoppable. However, resistance forces lead by Mulk have been developing a new weapon: Cybernetic Special Forces with the ability to think, dubbed the Ninja Warriors. Untested, these machines are given the orders to assassinate Benglar...</p>\n<p>Ninja Warriors plays as a side scrolling beat 'em up, and is a single player adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7637/the-ninja-warriors/\">The Ninja Warriors</a> arcade game. Players can choose from 3 different Ninja Warriors: Ninja, Kunoichi or Kamaitachi. The characters play differently, but share some common controls. Each can attack, jump, grab the enemy, block attacks or unleash a special attack on the entire screen. This special attack charges up gradually and can be reset by being knocked to the ground.</p>",

The predator's abilities includes attacking,\njumping, sliding and firing bolts from it's shoulder cannon. Additionally, the shoulder cannon can be charged up to unleash a\ndevastating attack that also harms the Predator.

These include kicks and jumps, and a dash ability that lets you slide into enemies to defeat them, and also climb walls.</p>\n<p>The fourth level is an exception, and consists of a game of (American) football, played with a simplified version of the rules.  The idea is simply to get a touchdown, while as usual progressing at least ten yards in four downs.  There are two plays: a running play, where you simply run as far as possible while avoiding the opposing team; and a passing play that starts with a pass that can gain you extra yards, but must be caught.</p>\n<p>Between levels there are bonus games.  You spin a wheel to determine what game you play out of five available.</p>",

Having defeating the evil along with other heroes, he returned to Endor to work peacefully. Some time has passed and after growing successful in this town, Torneko grew anxious. Hearing rumors one day about a \"Mysterious Dungeon\", Torneko meets with the king to ask permission to set up a new shop, closer to this Mysterious Dungeon. By exploring this cavern and returning safely with the prizes, Torneko hopes to become the most successful merchant in the world.</p>\n<p><em>Torneko no Daib\u014dken: Fushigi no Dungeon</em> is a overhead view game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/22346/hack/\">Hack</a>, what might be called a \"dungeon crawl\". Torneko must venture into the mysterious dungeon gathering treasure. He may equip any weapons and shields he finds there, as well as gather up items such as spell scrolls, staffs and herbs with a variety of effect. A variety of enemies, familiar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dragon+Quest+series\">Dragon Quest</a> series, await him. If Torneko successfully exits the dungeon, he is able to sell any of the items he has collected. This money then goes to improve the quality of his shop and living quarters. As the game progresses, Torneko is able to store special items in the vault, which he is then able to bring with him on subsequent trips to the dungeon.</p>",

Unfortunately, in his last encounter with Zora, Zoom has used up all his strength and now he is powerless so he asks George to take over.

Can George save his family and this galaxy?</p>\n<p>Guide George through 9 stages of intergalactic action armed with only his wits and the P.O.P....which is like a super vacuum. The P.O.P. can be used as a traveling tool by sucking onto walls and ceilings, it will enable George to climb up and across platforms.  As a weapon, the P.O.P. can be used to suck up blocks or enemies and spit out at other enemies. George can also use the P.O.P. to breathe under water! Talk about multi-functional!</p>\n<p>George's conditions are indicated by the number of hearts he has at the top of the screen.  By collecting more hearts, it will refill George's health. Food items will increase your score and by getting a high enough score in each stage, you may get to play a bonus game.</p>",

The spell that was cast would switch the realms of Bizyland and Lasyland around. The only people left unaffected by the spell were those who were not hard-working: notably the king of Bizyland as well as two children and a robot who were playing that day. Using the king's magic chalk, they must travel over Lasyland and restore enough of a percentage of each area so as to break the spell over each region.</p>\n<p>Cacoma Knight is a puzzle-painting game. Choosing one of the three characters, the player will begin each level only able to move around the edges. The player can start using the chalk to move away from the edges and draw a line over the darkened area and reach another edge. Once a section (always the smaller) is \"chalked off\" from the rest, it will be restored. Any treasure chests revealed will be opened for points bonuses. Different enemies will walk along the chalk lines or fly in between them. They can be destroyed by being in a section of the screen when it is restored.</p>",

Instead of being another side-scrolling shooter, <em>Bakuretsu Rantouden</em> is actually a one-on-one 2D fighter a la <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9465/street-fighter/\">Street Fighter</a> in which the most recognizable characters from the <em>Ch\u014d Aniki</em> series (yes, the speedo wearing bodybuilders included) fight each other for ultimate supremacy using special attacks and moves.</p>\n<p>An interesting feature is that the game honors its shooter roots, therefore instead of being restricted to walking backwards and forwards in the 2D plane and jumping around as in other fighting games, in this game all the characters can fly, meaning the fights actually occur in mid-air, allowing the players to dash all over the screen. Includes single player and 2-player vs modes.</p>",

Also included is a short campaign with different levels that plays mostly like a \"survival\" mode with the objective being to outlast the time limit and rack the most points.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the future, Earth's temperature rises and melts the polar ice caps, and Earth lies under a watery grave.  Years later, survivors of this disaster live on boats or man-made islands called Atolls.  Everyone in this new world is looking for a mythical place called Dry Land, which people believe that there is a map to Dry Land on a little girl's back named Enola.  A band of pirates who live an oil tanker called the Smokers are after Dry Land and they are trying to get Enola for the tattoo on her back.  A nameless drifter who has adapted to the new world and this causes him to have gills and webbed feet, gets involved in this whole \"quest for Dry Land\" so to speak and becomes responsible for Enola and the woman who looks after her named Helen.</p>\n<p>You play as the nameless drifter only known as The Mariner.  You play through three types of gameplay.  The first type of gameplay involves you sailing in a somewhat big area and clearing the area of Smokers. There is a second type of these sailing levels add something else.  You can save the Atollers from The Smokers.  The second type of gameplay is the swimming.  You swim underwater avoiding sea creatures and collecting items for money to use at the shop after you kill off Smokers on the Atolls.  Killing of The Smokers is the third type of gameplay. You run through the Atolls with your big knife at first and then you get three more weapons along the way which are a pistol, a speargun, and a machine gun.</p>",

Since there are so many candidates, it is decided that the person who finds the Great Treasure of Sierra Madrock will become the new Great Poobah.\nThe player takes control over Fred and Barney who also participate in the treasure hunt in order to make Fred the New Great Poobah.</p>\n<p><em>The Flintstones: The Treasure of Sierra Madrock</em> is a side-scrolling platformer that includes several board game elements. On a world map, Fred and Barney throw dices to determine how many fields they can move. </p>\n<p>There are different fields that hold different challenges.</p>\n<p>Most fields require you to finish a side-scrolling platforming level. Fred and Barney can jump, club their enemies and climb trees or stone pillars. Holding down the jump button lets them hover in the air for a short moment. Throughout the levels, different power-ups and items can be found: clamps are used as money, apples replenish some health, 100 stars grant an extra life to Barney or Fred and an empty Heart frame increases their life bar.</p>\n<p>On fields marked with a skull, a boss has to be defeated. </p>\n<p>Heart fields hold bonus games in which you have to collect as many items as possible within the time limit.</p>\n<p>At amusement parks, several mini-games can be played to win items or extra lives. Mini-games include: Memory; Balls O' Fun\", where you can win items by throwing a ball at them; a mini-game in which you have to stop monkeys from climbing down trees and stealing your items by hitting them with coconuts and others.</p>\n<p>In Cafes you can buy food to replenish your health.</p>\n<p>In stadiums you can participate in special challenges (3D cart races for example), in order to gain new abilities such as double jumps.</p>\n<p>While stadiums, cafes and amusement parks can be revisited, all other levels only need to be finished once.</p>\n<p>Fred and Barney are not the only characters that move about the playing field. You will also run into their wives Betty and Wilma as well as other characters that are also looking for the treasure. When Fred or Barney encounter their wives, they are dragged a few fields back. Other characters give them useful items if you can beat them at a challenge (usually a race).</p>\n<p>Other notable features are a password system and a competitive 2-player mode.</p>",

It's tough work, and afterwards they just want to relax and maybe shoot a few hoops in the parking lot. Of course they can't entirely leave their wild antics inside the studio, and will certainly bring some kind of zany onto the basketball court.</p>\n<p>Looney Tunes B-Ball is a 2-on-2 Basketball game, similar to the more well known <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=NBA+Jam\">NBA Jam</a>. However, Looney Tunes is much more informal and silly, though this level of silliness is set by the player via the Wackiness Meter on the main menu. Players choose their teams from the likes of: Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Wile E. Coyote, Tasmanian Devil, Sylvester, Yosemite Sam and Marvin Martian. Each player has unique statistics for their shooting, 3-pointers, defense, stamina and speed.</p>\n<p>Once on the court, the player can pass the ball, shoot the ball, grab a burst of speed or unleash a special defensive ability or a special offensive ability.. These abilities include cream pies, time bombs, sticks of dynamite and other fun toys from the ACME Corporation. Offensive Abilities must be \"bought\" by collecting gems and other items which occasionally show up on the basketball court.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The successful movie sequel Batman Returns spawned many different game adaptations. The SNES version presents the story of Batman's encounter with the Penguin and Catwoman as a side-scrolling beat 'em up, with one Batmobile driving sequence thrown in.</p>\n<p>There are two varieties of beat 'em up levels. One plays like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9836/final-fight/\">Final Fight</a> and similar games: Batman can move in two dimensions, beating up his enemies with various punches, kicks, combos, and special moves.\nSpecial gadgets to be used include the famous Batarang to take out enemies from a distance and \"Test Tubes\" filled with chemical explosives which will damage all enemies on the screen.</p>\n<p>In the second type of side-scrolling level, Batman can only move in one dimension, left or right. The Batarang is the standard weapon here, with punches only being used when the enemy gets close. Also in these levels, Batman can use a grappling hook to cross dangerous areas unharmed.</p>\n<p>Enemies in the beat 'em up levels usually belong to the Penguin's Red Triangle Circus Gang - clowns in all varieties: thin clowns, fat clowns, clowns on bikes, clowns armed with bazookas, and more. At the end of each level, there is a boss fight, including several encounters with Catwoman and the Penguin.</p>\n<p>In the Batmobile driving level, the action is viewed from behind. Batman has to evade clowns on bikes and shoot them down when he gets the chance. At the end of the road, another boss fight awaits.</p>\n<p>Digitized images from the film illustrate the storyline.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In this final appearance of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=the+Fire+ProWrestling+series\">Fire Pro series</a> on 16-bit consoles, the usual roster of over 150 wrestlers from several wresting promotions worldwide including several styles from Shoot or Pancrase to American and Lucha are joined by 80 Create-a-wrestler slots, plus secret wrestlers such as legends Gotch or Thesz or the roster of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/208319/blazing-tornado/\">Blazing Tornado</a>. While all fighters have fictional names, a lot of them are perfectly recognizable by their attire, stance and style. The CAW mode allows the player to create a wrestler from scratch, setting how they look (choosing face, size, clothing and setting colours) and fight, with several styles and stances available, as well as over 500 moves, each more suitable for certain styles and skills. To make them fight more realistically when controlled by the AI, the CAW mode also allows one to set move priorities.</p>\n<p>Five game modes are available, including World Championship (single and tag), Battle Royale, 5-man Elimination Mode, League Battle and the One Night Dream Match. There are several referees available (each with their own quirks) and variant rules, from allowing fighting outside the ring without count-out (or disallowing it) to the disabling of disqualifications from illegal moves.</p>",

        "description": "<p>First next-gen entry in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Nekketsu+Kouha+Kunio-kun\">Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun</a> brawler series. The story this time deals with the Nekketsu High gang making a field trip to Osaka. However rebel student Kunio and his pal Riki do a little more than sightseeing and get tangled up with the local Yakuzas so now its a battle for survival if they want to get out of the city alive.</p>\n<p>Gameplay-wise the game follows the already familiar beat 'em up/RPG hybrid template for the series, in which you control your character as he battles his way through side scrolling levels with a collection of attacks and special moves. These special moves can be acquired by collecting special items and your character gains experience for defeating enemies which allows you to upgrade his stats when leveling up. The battles are somewhat more chaotic as they are now staged as distinct waves that must be cleared before you can continue to scroll down the level, in each of these waves you'll face not only opposing gang members, but also neutral characters, policemen and other assorted NPCs that can fight on your side, against you, or simply ignore you depending on your behavior.</p>\n<p>New features in Shodai-NKKK include branching plot-points that lead you to different challenges and even alternate endings as well as completely reworked graphics to take advantage of the 16-bit SNES which now feature a more realistically proportioned character design.</p>",

Control different futuristic flying vehicles and blast your way through numerous enemies and obstacles. If your ship is getting too fast, you can use the brakes, however flying too slow damages your ship. Apart from the standard weapons, most ships have a special attack that can be charged by holding down the fire button. The action takes place on set tracks; leaving those tacks will cause heavy damage to your ship. You can repair your ship by flying over certain areas. At the end of end of each level, a boss has to be defeated.</p>",

All action is seen from a side-view perspective, meaning it is only possible to move players to the left or right. The player can choose between three different leagues: Men's League, Woman's League and Hyper League, which is a league for robots. Two buttons are used to control the ball, one for normal actions and one for Hyper Plays, special attacks that can only be learned and used in the Hyper League. How a player will block or attack depends on the ball's speed and the players position. Team members who aren't under the player's direct control will also act on their own by positioning themselves or preparing spikes. They will, however, not block spikes on their own but it is possible to let players not under direct control block spikes by pressing one of the action buttons at the right moment.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based off of the Jean Claude Van Damme film Timecop, this game acts as a sequel of sorts. We learned well from the film that the power time travel affords corrupts all men weaker than the Muscles from Brussels, and this has extended to the original inventor of time travel. He proclaims himself dictator of the universe, captures Van Damme as he arrives from fixing all the wrongs in the film, and challenges him to a \"duel across time.\" Platforming action follows across multiple periods of history.</p>\n<p>The primary feature of this game is its digitized characters, uncommon for console games of that era. Actors were taped in front of a bluescreen and stills were taken from the video to create all characters and their animations. The effect is impressive for the SNES, though it does result in robotic enemies who do not respond well to being punched or kicked. The \"timing,\", both in terms of controlling your character and fighting with enemy characters seems off through the entire game.</p>\n<p>There are 15 levels in total, most of which are standard fighting platform levels. Three basic fighting moves are available to the character, not including jumping and crouching kicks, and not including the use of a gun with extremely limited ammo. Some vehicle levels are mixed in, and the game culminates in a jetpack duel over Los Angeles with the villainous time travel creator fellow.</p>\n<p>The game also featured some rare use of digital voice, primarily in the \"FBI... Get on it!\" background theme in the first few levels.</p>",

Players assume the role of one or both of the Run Saber characters. Choosing either Sheena with her Ice powers or Allen with his Thunder powers, players must defeat mutant monsters. The Run Sabers can move side to side, jump in the air, attack with a sword, climb along walls or roofs, slide across the ground and drop-kick. Additionally, each character has a special move, which damages everything on the screen with either Ice or Lightning, and which can be activated by collecting orb power-ups.

        "description": "<p><em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Fighting Edition</em> is a game directly based on the world-known television series. In this game, you can choice among 8 playable characters: the Power Rangers' Zords (Thunder Megazord, Mega Tigerzord, Ninja Megazord, Shogun Megazord) or some of their known villains (Lipsyncher, Silver Horns, Goldar, Lord Zedd). The title offers 3 game modes: Story Mode (1-Player only), Fighting Mode (2-Player) and Trial Mode (a survival mode for 1-Player only).</p>\n<p>During Story Mode, the goal is to defeat all the 4 Zords, the 4 villains up to Lord Zedd and last, but not least, Ivan Ooze. In this mode, you can opt by the Thunder Megazord (formed by the 5 original Rangers) or by the Mega Tigerzord (formed in conjunction with the White Ranger). The Fighting Mode is a traditional 2-Player head-to-head combat, where you can choose any of the 4 Zords or even the 4 villains. Trial Mode is an Endurance-like option, and the main goal is to win as many battles as possible using only 1 health bar (that will be partially replenished after each battle).</p>\n<p>As well as many fighting games, you can take advantage of a Power Bar (here, it fills automatically): if you execute a Super Move when this bar is flashing, it will cause more damage, besides increasing 1 level. Once you have reached its maximum status, it's possible to execute power-up versions of Special Moves or even unleash high-damage blows (Super Moves).</p>",

Adam Warlock calls on the heroes to recover the 6 Infinity Gems before they are used for evil.</p>\n<p>You may choose ones of five heroes: Spider-Man, Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man and Wolverine. Each one has different stats and abilities. (i.e. Spider-Man is agile. Hulk is strong, Iron Man can double-jump with his rocket boots, etc.) Initially you can choose a training area in Avenger headquarters or four levels. As you complete levels, most open up. Each hero can be equipped with gems to boost their abilities in each section. These must be obtained by finding them in the levels.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is fairly similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/11735/x-men-mutant-apocalypse/\">X-Men-Mutant Apocalypse</a>. Combat is all on a 2D plane. Each hero has basic jumps and attacks and special moves that can be executed with button combinations like quarter-rolls. Enemies include various villains from the Marvel Universe and evil doubles of various Marvel heroes.</p>",

This will eventually lead him to meet up with our beloved Valkyrie and mark the beginning of their adventures.</p>\n<p>Xandra has all the abilities of a standard platformer character, which allow him to jump around and navigate the many obstacles found in the game. Additionally he's armed with a pitchfork which he can use to impale his enemies and stick to some surfaces. Collecting coins allow him to purchase extra lives, but there are no added weapons or spells as in the Valkyrie games.</p>",

This sequel however, takes the action to outer space as the gang attempts to rescue Goemon Impact (Goemon's giant mecha) from a strange planet.</p>\n<p>The game is based around a stage-select hub from which you select which character you want to play as and then attempt to clear the game's many side scrolling stages in standard action platformer fashion, navigating the obstacles and defeating all enemies you run into with your weapons. Since each one of Goemon's allies got stranded on a different planet, you must take control of each one of them in order to clear the stages and recover the special ability unique to each character that must be later put to use to release Goemon Impact. As in other games of the series there are also loads of mini-games and unique gameplay sequences triggered in boss fights, bonus stages and special situations. These involve shooter sequences, racing &amp; sport games and other assorted diversions.</p>",

Game controls are simple: B Button makes Jerry/Tuffy to jump (tapping it again lightly upon landing will activate their Super Jumps), while A/Y/X Buttons will make them to throw marbles upward (Y Button) and downward (X/Y Buttons) in the enemies.</p>\n<p>To earn extra lives throughout the game, players have two available options: the rarest and, sometimes, hardest way is to find a 1-Up icon; however, the easiest mode is to collect 100 of small balls of cheese scattered throughout the levels (Cheese Bits). Also, Jerry and Tuffy's health meters are displayed in the form of four hearts, that can be replenished through collectible larger cheese wedges (Cheese Chunks). At the end of each world, Jerry and Tuffy will take a confrontation with Tom, the Cat.</p>",

Goemon has been captured and his friend Ebisumaru goes out to try to find and rescue him. In order to do so, he must traverse a series of maze-like levels avoiding obstacles and enemies and get to the end zone.</p>\n<p>The game is played from an isometric perspective from which you can get a good view of the mazes and Ebisumaru. You have no direct control of Ebisumaru per se, but instead switch special blocks around the mazes that can change Ebisumaru's direction of travel and such. You must reach the end of each stage before time runs out, and get all the power-ups and items laid in each maze in hopes of getting to Goemon alive.</p>",

The boy must enter the dreamworld, defeat the demon and rescue the nobility.</p>\n<p><em>Yume Meiky\u016b: Kigurumi Daib\u014dken</em> is a first-person dungeon crawler with step-movement and random encounters that plays like a simplified version of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/145/dungeon-master-series/\">Dungeon Master series</a> template, albeit with a turn-based engine. One of the main differences is the presentation: instead of the usual dank and dark dungeon with grim walls covered by rusty chains, this game has surfaces made of cake and candy. Instead of skeletons and orcs as enemies, it features furry and cute anthropomorphic animals. Once defeated, these creatures occasionally leave behind their skin, which the hero can collect and wear for a change in statistics and new abilities. They also sometimes drop candy, the game's currency. There are several shops on each level: a tailor shop to change and store skins (it is possible to carry a maximum of six skins), shops for potions and health boosts, etc.</p>\n<p>When a random enemy encounter occurs, a menu with the options of fighting or escaping appears. After choosing to fight, another menu pops up, which includes the commands Punch, Kick, Talent, Defend, and Item. After choosing either of the first two the player is presented with a grid where an icon (a fist or a foot) can be positioned over a part of the enemy body. This provides a strategic element to the game, as different enemies have different weak spots that can be exploited. The Talent option accesses the special ability that a skin may possess.</p>",

Whereas the main Puyo Puyo games are aimed at defeating AI or human controlled opponents in puzzle duels (where each player has his own play area in which color-coded \"puyos\" fall and must clear them out faster than his opponent), Nazo Puyo instead challenges the player with different single-player scenarios in which a specific objective must be completed (such as clearing only the red Puyos, or performing a specific sequence of combos, etc.).</p>\n<p>The game uses the mold of a top-down RPG in which you control either the young magician Arle or fighting queen Rulue as they explore towns and dungeons in their search for adventure. Each quest involves finding an NPC who will trigger one of the aforementioned scenarios and rewards Arle (or Rulue) with experience points and unique items that increase her stats.</p>",

Defeated enemies sometimes drop power-ups that improve the helicopter's standard weapon or equip it with homing missiles as secondary weapon. In addition to the standard \"shooting mode\" D-Force also features an \"exploration mode\". In exploration mode, the player's helicopter is attacked by animals instead of warplanes or other helicopters. In this mode, the shoulder buttons can be used to change the helicopters altitude and attack (or dodge) enemies at different heights.</p>",

While he can also defeat enemies by jumping on them, his most important weapons are four different hairstyles: His first hairstyle allows him to skewer and throw his enemies, destroy porous blocks as well as cling to and jump up certain ledges. A mohawk can be thrown at enemies like a boomerang or thrown into certain walls, from where it serves as a trampoline. Braids can be used as a grappling hook and a corkscrew-like haircut lets him bounce on his head to jump higher than normal. When Rocky is attacked by an enemy, he loses his current haircut. If he is attacked while not wearing any special haircut, he loses a life.</p>",

Combining at least three matching symbols in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line does not only clear them off the screen, but also deals damage to an opponent. This means that players do not only have to keep their game area clear, but also pay attention to their characters health bar. Once a block touches the top of the screen or the health bar is diminished the game ends.</p>\n<p>There are four different icons that have different effects when combined:\nBooks, swords and rocks deal damage to an opponent by attacking with fireballs, dragons or swords.\nBottles heal a certain amount of health.\nPurple blocks have no effect, but clog up the screen nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Chain reactions result in particularly powerful attacks or place one or more grey blocks inside the opponents area. They can be destroyed just like ordinary blocks, but they always stay in the same spot and do not fall down.</p>\n<p>More complex chain reactions give access to special attacks, up to three of which can be held and activated with the shoulder buttons. Special attacks have different effects that include clearing all purple blocks, using all potions and clearing the bottom three lines.</p>",

The emphasis of <em>Super Scope 6</em>'s gameplay is on first person shooting, using the required Super Scope accessory to aim. It features a total of six game modes, categorized as either <em>Blastris</em> or <em>LaserBlazer</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Blastris Mode</em> features a variety of unrelated games.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Blastris A</strong> is a falling block game based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tetris\">Tetris</a> and plays very similar. Blocks appear on the left side of the screen and move towards the right side of the screen, where they will fit into play. The goal is to have the blocks on any column line up and destroy themselves. Each level requires five of these to happen. Unlike <em>Tetris</em>, the player cannot move or even rotate blocks. Instead each section of the block can be destroyed by shooting it. Higher difficulty levels increase the speed of gameplay</li>\n<li><strong>Blastris B</strong> is a falling block game based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Columns\">Columns</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Puyo+Puyo\">Puyo Puyo</a>. On each screen are a number of \"jelly blocks\" which must be destroyed to complete the stage. New blocks appear at the top of the screen and move towards the bottom where they fit into play. Blocks can be destroyed by lining up a row of 4 blocks of the same colour. The player is unable to move the falling blocks but may cycle their colour by shooting at them.</li>\n<li><strong>Mole Patrol</strong> is combination of Whack-a-Mole and a shooting gallery. A number of moles appear on the screen with a flag indicating the amount that need to be destroyed that level, before jumping into a pipe. From there the moles will climb out of any one of 12 holes on the screen and the player must shoot them as fast as possible.

As their ambassador, they choose to send the Metal Morph, a being made from living metal, as he is the only being that can survive the inter-dimensional travel. The people of Earth have created a Hypergate, which links the two galaxies together. Upon arriving at the alien destination, the Metal Morph is quickly ambushed and is taken to an alien lab for study so that they can travel through the Hypergate themselves. The Metal Morph quickly escapes and begins to get back to his sabotaged ship...</p>\n<p><em>Metal Morph</em> is a side-scrolling platformer. As the Metal Morph, you can jump, duck and shoot, as well as transform into an invulnerable liquid blob of metal. While as a blob, you can also travel through pipes to get to areas you couldn't normally. Power ups such as triple shots and homing missiles make battle easier for you.</p>\n<p>The game also has sections where you fly your spaceship to track down your stolen pods. In flight mode, you can move the ship up, down, left and right while shooting enemies and dodging their incoming shots. Power ups such as speed up (which makes the ship travel faster to its destination) and shields (which prevent instant death) can also be found.</p>",

However the atmosphere has changed to be a lot more cartoonish and happy. Controlling either Justy or Liberty, the player is able to move back and forth, climb ladders, cross ropes and dig holes in some types of surface. The enemies then fall into these holes and the player can walk over them. The goal in each level is to get all the candy.</p>\n<p>There is also a battle mode that puts Justy versus Liberty to see who can fetch the most candy.</p>",

Each player controls a grid of 10x6 sections (represented by hearts) initially made up of clear hearts. The player moves their cursor over the clear hearts to turn them into one of four colors: red, yellow, blue, and green. Sometimes treasures will show up on the board. When several hearts of the same color are adjacent to one another, the player can clear them... which pushes all the hearts (and treasures) down towards the bottom. The goal is to be the player with the most treasures to end the round.</p>\n<p><em>Sailor Moon</em> characters featured are primarily from the S Series and includes: Sailor Moon, Sailor Mars, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Venus, Sailor Jupiter, Chibius, Tuxedo Mask, Sailor Neptune, Sailor Uranus, and Sailor Pluto.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Bish\u014djo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Kondo wa Puzzle de Oshioki yo!!</em> is a falling block competitive puzzle game. Players begin by choosing from a selection of Sailor Moon licensed characters, each with a unique special attack. The player is presented with a board filled with colored blocks in three colors: red, blue and green. The goal is to remove all the blocks from play. Clicking on a block that touches several adjacent blocks of the same color will remove them all from play. As each player successfully clears blocks, they drop \"black blocks\" on their opponent as well as increase their power bar. Black blocks cannot be removed by normal means and disappear only when large ammounts of blocks are removed adjacent to them. As the power bar charges, players can unleash their special ability, often an attack on the other player.</p>\n<p>This puzzle game is based on the \"S\" series of Sailor Moon and includes characters from there: Sailor Moon, Sailor Mars, Sailor Venus, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Jupiter, Chibiusa, Tuxedo Mask, Sailor Uranus, Sailor Neptune and Sailor Pluto.</p>",

Players first select a character from among five Sailor Scouts and Chibiusa, each with a unique special move. They will then challenge each other in competition. Each player has a board which contains some balloons, in either red, yellow, green or blue. These balloons can be shot at in order to gain points and fill up the power bar. Balloons of the same color that are adjacent to one another with all be destroyed and generate more points. The goal is to avoid being the player whose balloons are pushed downwards off the board, and to make the opponent receive this fate. As groups of balloons are destroyed, they can reveal power-ups as well as produce black balloons on the opponent's board. Black balloons can only be destroyed by groups of colored balloons being removed adjacent to them. Players with a filled power bar can unleash special abilities.</p>",

Dr. Light immediately responds by forming a soccer team of Mega Mans to counter Dr. Wily's latest scheme.</p>\n<p><em>Mega Man Soccer</em> is an overhead view soccer game featuring characters from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Mega+Man\">Mega Man</a> series. Players begin by selecting either Exhibition, Tournament, League or Capcom Championship modes. Depending on the mode, a team must be formed using either all of one type of robot, or a mixture of different types assigned to different positions on the field. In any case, each soccer team has 8 players on the field including the goalie. The goal of each team is to score on the net of the opposing team, earning points to win the game. The action follows the ball as it is tossed around the field from player to player. Once a player's team member has the ball they can choose to pass it to another teammate, shoot the ball straight ahead or perform a clearing kick (if the goalie). If the player does not have the ball, they are given control of the nearest player to the ball and can slide tackles or shoulder tackles to try to gain possession. Each type of robot has a special move that can be initiated.</p>",

Some fighters (besides the turtles) will be familiar, such as the Rat King, or even Shredder (now called \"Cyber-Shredder\" here).</p>\n<p>Though even people familiar with the turtles will see differences in them. They can now, for example, do moves involving projectiles, such as \"fireballs\".</p>\n<p>The game's modes include a story mode, where you can only pick one of the turtles and go on fighting opponents in order to rescue April and Splinter, and a tournament mode, where you fight only for the fame and money.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Those lab mice bent on world domination, Pinky and The Brain, have hatched a new scheme to try to take over the world! Their latest plan is to steal a prized script from Warner Bros. Studios, which they will produce to earn them enough money to take over the world. The CEO of Warner Bros. asks Yakko, Wakko and Dot to recover all 24 scenes of the film's script.</p>\n<p><em>Animaniacs</em> is a platform game where you control the three Animaniacs, Yakko, Wakko and Dot. Players can cycle between their current Animaniac by using R Button, and in addition to jumping, the player can stack the Animaniacs on top of each other to reach places they couldn't on their own. The Animaniacs can pick up and throw small objects to attack, as well as dash to break objects and dodge enemies. Larger objects can be pushed, to access higher areas, or sometimes to reveal secrets.</p>\n<p>If a Warner is captured by Ralph, Warner Bros.' security guard (which is equivalent to \"death\"), the player has a chance to rescue all the Warners lost by entering the Water Tower stage from the map. After negotiating this small stage and reaching the top of the tower, it opens and all the Warners are rescued.</p>\n<p>Script scenes are key to finishing the game completely. A few are given to players for finishing the level, but others are hidden in secret places and players must perform special tasks to locate them all. The other collectable aside from script scenes are coins. These coins are used to start a slot machine that is at the bottom of the screen. Depending on the way the reels land, players may get an extra continue, invincibility, all of the Warners returned, more coins, or lose some of their coins.</p>",

Forcing the people who live there to be his slaves, Sk\u00fcljagger rules unopposed with an iron fist. A brave sailor named Storm \nJaxon decides to rebel and steal Sk\u00fcljagger's magical sword. Now he must fight for his life and ultimately to free the Westican people.</p>\n<p><em>Sk\u00fcljagger: Revolt of the Westicans</em> is a sidescrolling platform game. Players select between a 1 player game, an alternating turn 2 player game or Bubblegum Practice. The player controls Storm Jaxon who is able to run left and right, jump and swing Sk\u00fcljagger's magic sword. Storm must reach the end of each level before time runs out or risk losing a life. Under normal circumstances, touching an enemy or projectile will cause him to die, though the sword is often able to destroy projectiles. By collecting red jewels, Storm is able to both augment the sword with a projectile attack and be protected from one enemy attack. Green jewels will also protect from one enemy attack, however collecting 25 of them will grant an extra life. Blue jewels add additional time for Storm to complete each level. Finding a mask will make Storm invulnerable for a short time. These power-ups are either floating in the air of each level or hidden away in chests, boxes, rocks and coconuts. However these items which may hide items can also be picked up and thrown at enemies.</p>\n<p>In addition to the power-ups listed above, fruity bubblegum can also be found. Only one bubble gum flavor can be carried at a time and it will be held until the player activates it. Grape bubblegum encases Storm in a giant invulnerable bubble that can bounce higher than jumping alone. Cherry bubblegum will require the player to inflate manually, but will allow Storm to fly. Beware as over inflating the bubble will pop it. Watermelon bubblegum will turn Storm into a projectile that damages anything on the screen, also gathering items. Orange bubblegum will let Storm spit out pellets at enemies which will destroy them. Bubblegum power-ups can be tested in the special bubblegum practice option of the menu.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the cartoon series of the same name, King Arthur and the knights of Camelot have been encased inside glass by Morgana Le Faye. Only the Spell of Spells would be able to free them. Merlin, knowing that the world would come to ruin without King Arthur uses his magic to search all of space and time for replacements. Finding the New York Knights football team and their quarterback, Arthur King, Merlin transports them back to Camelot and gives them magical armor. Transformed into; Sir Arthur, Sir Breeze, Sir Brick, Sir Darren, Sir Gallop, Sir Lancelot, Sir Lug, Sir Phil, Sir Tone, Sir Trunk, Sir Wally and Sir Zeke, they must rescue the real Knights of the Round Table. In order to do so, the Arthur must recover the 12 keys of truth from Morgana's lieutenants each of which can only by touched by a specific knight. However in order to be able to defeat them, Arthur must first recover Excalibur and overcome other tasks.</p>\n<p><em>King Arthur &amp; the Knights of Justice</em> is a top-down action game. It might be mistaken for an RPG, however the abilities of characters do not change over the course of the game. Players control Arthur King and can recruit two additional party members from the knights. Each knight has his own statistics in various areas including: Life Force, Defense, Strength and Speed. These party members are computer controlled with their own energy bars. Arthur can move up, down, left and right, block with his shield and parry with his shield. Arthur can swing his sword at any time but the damage inflicted depends on how much strength bar he has. The strength bar replenishes itself naturally over time, but is depleted every time Arthur swings his sword. Each knight including Arthur has a health bar, when this bar runs out, the knight is defeated. It can be restored by returning to Camelot or using items such as healing herbs. Arthur can carry a variety of different items accessible from the menu. Other menu functions include looking at the map, changing preferences and reviewing the statistics of the knights.</p>",

But is it really his handiwork, or is there someone else controlling him? Unravel the mystery while traveling to various locales, fighting Von Hesler's henchmen and picking up (CPU-controlled) companions along the way.</p>\n<p>Spike McFang has three main methods of attack: by striking out with his cape, throwing his hat like a boomerang, or using a magic card. Cards can also heal his health or give his companions extra strength. Spike can also devour the still-beating hearts of his vanquished foes (or the dropped tomatoes of his vanquished foes if you're playing the sanitized North American version) to regain health. There are a total of four different hats that Spike can purchase as upgrades in his battle against animated garlic bulbs, bomb-throwing cats, head-spinning plants and a plethora of other dangerous enemies.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This side-scrolling beat em' up game is based on a 1992 Paramount Pictures animated movie which was the first ever to feature an all-Black main cast. The characters were originally from comedian Robin Harris' \"B\u00e9b\u00e9's Kids\" (pronounced Bay-Bay) stand-up comedy act. They're described as little hellions and bad-ass troublemaker kids.  In this game, someone has taken control of the Fun World amusement park, and you've got to help Kahlil, LaShawn, and PeeWee make things right. </p>\n<p>You can play as either Kahlil or LaShawn and can use each character's different special attacks. Kahlil uses a spin-tuck to take out almost any enemy you meet and LaShawn uses powerful cartwheels. Enemies such as animatronic robots and security guards must be taken out in the first time-limited level.  Some items can also be picked up and thrown at enemies.   The second level has the baby PeeWee in a china shop knocking glasses off shelves and you must break 10 before they hit you or the ground or are grabbed by your caretaker Robin.  There is also a haunted house maze level where you must keep trying different doors until you find the exit\nwhile avoiding mummies along the way. Then there's a pirate ship beat em' up level and eventually you make your way to the underground control center and the Big Boss.</p>",

The mission is to neutralise the offensive forces of the Zarak army, who have recently invaded a smaller neighbouring country. The Zarak army has many ground units, including tanks, stinger-missile launchers, SCUD missiles and armored vehicles.</p>\n<p>To accomplish the ultimate goal of defeating the Zarak army, players venture out on numerous missions (called \"sorties\") that have varied and specific objectives. Typically, various installations such as radar sites, air bases or ground units are the target. Other missions include disabling an oil-pipeline and destroying SCUD launchers before they fire. </p>\n<p>Pre-mission screens ask the player to select from the two planes. Then,  the player can specify the armament to carry into the sortie. Air-to-ground and air-to-air missiles are available for each of the planes. Here, a strategic choice between countering either air units or ground units has to be made, as each area (of which there are eight) is patrolled by opposing enemy F-15 jets.</p>\n<p>The game is played through the isometric-perspective, and the plane's speed and direction can be be adjusted in real-time. Altitude however, is fixed. A missile/bomb-target is constantly shown on the ground before the plane, allowing players to aim at units, or, with the F-15, a lock-on targeting system is available.</p>\n<p>The game also makes use of a briefing before each mission, and also a further briefing by an animated colonel on the tarmac just before take-off. Various debriefing screens are shown also, and, if the player attains a certain strike rate, a \"GNN\" news story may play out. For each mission, a time-limit and minimum destruction-rate must be met. You can take-off as often as need be to attain this.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Planet Earth is in danger from assorted villains who want to destroy the environment for their own nefarious purposes! Far off in the Horsehead Nebula, a group of shapeshifting aliens known as World Watchers assign planets for their Watchers to protect. A purple alien, Widget, is an apprentice assigned with the job of protecting Earth. Along for the ride is his intelligent sidekick, Mega Brain.</p>\n<p><em>Super Widget</em> is a platform game for the Super Nintendo, based on the cartoon show, <em>Widget</em>. It shares some similarities to the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=039854000171\">Felix the Cat</a> in how the main character upgrades their weapon as they collect more power-ups.</p>\n<p>Widget navigates through various worlds as he travels to Earth, picking up 'W' coins - 100 earns him an extra life. There are also special power ups in different categories - these allow Widget to transform into a variety of different creatures, each with their own different ranged attack. As the player collects more power-ups of the same type (up to three), they change into more powerful creatures. If the player gets hit while transformed, they change back to the previous creature. If they get hit while as normal Widget, they lose a life.</p>\n<p>At the end of each world is a boss character. These are larger enemies that require learning their basic pattern, avoiding their attacks, and then firing back with your own. After defeating the boss, the player is graded based on how long it took to complete the level and their combat skills. They are then awarded 'Watcher Experience' based on these grades.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Time Trax</em> is based off of the 1993-94 sci-fi action series starring Dale Midkiff; you take the role of Darien Lambert, captain of the Fugitive Retrieval Section of Washington D.C. It is the year 2193 and your once high arrest record has started to decline sharply as routine trackdowns end in mysterious disappearances. It is discovered that noted MIT scientist Dr. Mordecai 'Mo' Sahmbi has been sending criminals back in time to 1993 using his invention the TRAX time machine, and has gone back himself. TRAX is captured by the police, and three guesses as to who is tasked with capturing the criminals and sending them back to 2193.</p>\n<p>As Lambert, your primary targets in this game are neo-Nazi racist Sepp Dietrich and Sahmbi himself. You do have some equipment to help you: your supercomputer S.E.L.M.A. (Specified Encapsulated Limitless Memory Archive), disguised as an AT&amp;T Mastercard and whose holographic persona resembles a British nanny, and the PPT (Pellet Projection Tube), a weapon capable of stunning a human from periods of a couple of minutes to a few hours and can fire pellets that render humans transportable to the future, disguised a keyless car alarm remote. Also, you have the ability to \"time stall\" (this slows the speed of images reaching your brain, allowing you to react quickly) and your Mosh-Ti (an Occidental improvement of martial arts) skills to rely on if the situation gets dire.</p>\n<p>You'll run through the alleys of the future, through the Smithsonian (circa 1993), ride a motorcycle and jet-ski, battle criminals atop a construction site, and do so much more until you've finally captured the two fugitives.</p>",

Their fighting is interrupted by the threat of invasion from a much more potent alien race. The three planets find that they are able to set aside their differences long enough to battle their shared menace.</p>\n<p>Each planet sends a warrior to deal with the threat. There is a robot named Triton, a cat-like quadruped named Panthera, and a giant red bipedal insect alien name Alcedes. The single player of the game controls one of these characters at a time and can switch at any time. If the current character loses all of his health, the player is sent back to the start of the level and that one character receives a health refill.</p>\n<p>Each character has special attributes that help the team. For example, Panthera's relatively small size allows him to squeeze into spots where the other two characters can not travel. The characters can gather a number of unique power-ups and weapons to help them on their mission.</p>",

(001 is a baby and can't be taken on missions). Using these special abilities consumes SP that slowly regenerate. </p>\n<p>In addition to their special abilities, the cyborgs also have four attributes that govern their attack and defensive powers, their amount of SP and SP regeneration speed. </p>\n<p>Before every mission, one cyborg is assigned leader and two more can be selected by the player. Only one cyborg can be controlled at a time, but it is possible to switch between cyborgs at any time. All cyborgs share the same HP and SP-bar. Throughout the levels, experience points can be collected and used to increase a cyborg's attributes after a completed mission.</p>",

The first world is the Medieval World, land of castles, dungeons, undead skeleton warriors, malicious knights, and lots of keys and doors. The goal is to collect a number of puzzle pieces and get out of the world. Other world themes include Egyptian, Prehistoric, and Futuristic.</p>\n<p>Dream TV is a 2-player action/adventure game with only a single player. The player must alternately control both kids throughout the game. The player can either adopt a split-screen view showing both kids, or a fullscreen view that focuses on one kid. The game includes challenges that require the player to use both kids simultaneously, such as a see-saw where both kids need to bounce on either end in order to propel one up onto a higher platform.</p>",

One day, a woman named Belle happens into his castle. The Beast must pursue her through his own deadly castle for both their safety.</p>\n<p>This is a side-scrolling action platformer. The Beast is rather slow but with a powerful claw strike and jump-stomp attack. He can also scale certain types of walls and can catch the edges of platforms. He also has a special roar that allows him to stun certain enemies. This becomes necessary in some sections in order to freeze bats so the Beast can use them as stepping stones to higher platforms.</p>\n<p>The game has a time limit in the form of the magical rose. The Beast must battle through such levels as the dungeon and the main hall battling giant spiders, rats, rogue candle monsters, live gargoyle statues, and enchanted brooms, while collecting books for points (since Belle likes books) and magic mirrors that allow the Beast to see further into the current level to anticipate what challenges await.</p>",

The goal of the game is to travel down the road, collecting Kiwi's before the timer runs out, avoiding obstacles along the way.  The Kiwi's will get harder to catch as the game goes on, jumping over Taz and actually outrunning him at times.</p>\n<p>Some obstacles Taz faces are trees, telephone poles, tour buses, even pterodactyls who will bring Taz back at the beginning of the level, but also have to avoid characters such as Axl &amp; Bull, a pair of gators who try to capture Taz for the zoo, The She-Devil who is in love with Taz and if the player is caught by her, the game is instantly over and Wendal T. Wolf, who will jump on Taz's back and cover the screen with his hands making it hard to see.</p>\n<p>You can avoid some obstacles by using Taz's tornado spin, but using the spin will cause Taz's health meter to drop, but it can be refilled by eating Kiwi's along with blue and red birds, bushrats and items thrown to Taz by Didgeri Dingo, but beware, he can also throw obstacles at Taz as well including T.N.T.  There is also a bonus stages after completing three levels in which you collect as many items you can in the allotted time to raise the score.</p>",

Also included is a career mode where you create a wrestler and control each aspect of his career up to his final victory in the inter-league tournament.

        "description": "<p><em>Dragon Ball Z: Super But\u014dden 3</em> (known as <em>Dragon Ball Z: Ultime Menace</em> in France) is the last installment to the Super But\u014dden series for the SNES, which in this occasion is based on the Majin Buu saga. Avaliable charachers are Goku, Goten, Kid Trunks, Majin Vegita, Junior Gohan, Kaiohshin, Majin Boo, Darbura and C-18, plus another one available as a secret character: Future Trunks.</p>\n<p>Split screen mode is maintained, but now you can now fly up or down while on the same screen as your opponent. You can also struggle with your rival pushing with your arms together to test your button smashing abilities, or execute new Meteor Combos. Scenarios will also be different (mainly based on Buu saga) and will include alternative versions of themselves with different times of the day as well.</p>\n<p>The game allows you to take part either in a 8 player martial arts tournament with an eliminatory system or to make single combats against the CPU or another player. This makes <em>Super But\u014dden 3</em> the only game of the series without a Story Mode. It can be explained by the fact that when the game was released while the Buu saga was still on a very early stage in Japanese TV.</p>",

You can attack your opponent with several moves (unique to each character) and upon \"locking-on\" by getting too close to the other wrestler you can execute grapples and throws.</p>\n<p>The game uses 2D graphics from a heightened camera view and includes a plethora of game modes including single player Championship and Tournament modes (with single or Tag variants for both), 2 Player Vs., Team Battle, and a Training in which you can learn the basics of the game.</p>",

The biggest addition however is the inclusion of a 4-player royal rumble mode and the ability to perform team-up moves in the tag matches.</p>\n<p>The game casts you as a wrestler of your choice in the official Zen-Nihon Pro Wrestling league and pits you against the other featured wrestlers in grappling matches. As in the original you get to pick between several game modes including: Tournament, Championship (single or tag) Vs, Team (with the new 4-player variant) and Training.</p>",

This title features the adventures of Goku from the battle against Piccolo in the martial arts tournament to the conclusion of the Cell Games.</p>\n<p>The initially available characters are Goku (without SSJ), Vegeta (without SSJ), C-20, C-16, Piccolo, Freezer, C-18 and Original Cell. But upon entering the right code you can expand the list with Future Trunks (SSJ), Gohan (SSJ), Perfect Cell, Goku (SSJ), and Vegeta (SSJ), all of them relegated to occasionally appear in the Story Mode either as rivals or as alternative selectable characters.</p>\n<p>In the story mode, players select which fighter to pit against each opponent as while advancing rounds leading up to the battle against Perfect Cell. Players can also go one-on-one against another player or a CPU opponent. There is also a martial arts tournament mode, to play against eight players or CPU opponents in a elimination tournament.</p>",

Players aim to become a professional fisherman and can travel by themselves or along with Hank.</p>\n<p>There are four different fishing areas players advance to as they win each round of the tournament. Players travel by boat on the water, select a fishing spot and then select lure and cast fish. Certain types of fish are only available at specific spots. There is also a fish radar that makes a sound when there is fish nearby. Players need to select the correct type of lure (there are about 20), keep track of weather conditions and the limited time available in tournaments. Some fish fight back hard and need to be reeled in with careful timing.</p>\n<p>The four tournaments are Local Amateur Tournament, Amateur Bass Championship, Pro Bass Tournament and Bassin' World Championship. About eight types of fish can be caught.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Dirt Trax Fx is a Motocross racing game in which players can choose between 8 drivers, differing in top speed, acceleration, turning and braking, to compete on 22 different tracks. The tracks feature lots of mounds, ramps, pits and other similar obstacles. Parts of a track might also be covered in water mud or ice. To successfully navigate the motorbike through these obstacles, the shoulder buttons can be used to lean the bike, while pressing up or down changes the angle of the bike. Before the game begins, players can choose between four different bikes ranging from 50cc to 500cc (the last bike needs to be unlocked first). The choice of the bike greatly affects the game's speed as well as the overall difficulty.</p>\n<p>Apart from the main race, there is also a \"Rad Tag\" mode. In this mode, a timer ticks down that can only be stopped by hitting the opponent. The driver whose timer reaches zero first loses.</p>",

Something went wrong however, and three new life forms turned against their creators: Brutally savage Orcs, cybernetic androids called Cromes and genetically enhanced human soldiers code named M.A.R.S. Players take control of a secretly assembled force and must try to restore order.</p>\n<p><em>War 2410</em> is a turn-based strategy game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/30697/famicom-wars/\">Famicom Wars</a>. Players move various units, such as mechs, tanks, troops or planes over a grid-map. Units differ in movement and attacking range. Some ground units cannot attack air units and vice versa. Terrain also affects combat as some types of terrain, like trees or buildings improve a units defense. Attacked units always counterattack as long as the attacker is within range. The goal of most missions is to destroy all enemy units, while it is sometimes necessary to capture the enemies' bases. Units cannot not be improved or modified and every mission starts with all units already in place.</p>",

The player must now guide their efforts in trying to throw over the Kyllen. </p>\n<p><em>War 3010</em> is a turn-based strategy game in which players move spaceships over a grid-map. There are different types of ships, such as Fighters, Marauders or Destroyers, that differ in movement range and weapon power. Weapon power is also divided into long and short range, i.e. a ship that is very good at long range combat may have poor close ranged weapons etc. During combat, the following actions can be chosen from a menu: Movement, Attacking, terrain information, unit information, a map of the battlefield, overview of all units, including those of the enemy; and an option to scout planets for technology. When an attacking unit is within range of an attacked unit, the attacked unit will always counter-attack (if it isn't destroyed first). In later missions it becomes possible to scout planets for technology and upgrade ships, as well as take control of space stations to build new ships. Ships cannot be taken into the next mission however.</p>",

        "description": "<p>RPM Racing was preceded by Rareware's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7501/rc-pro-am/\">R.C. Pro-Am</a> in 1988 and Electronic Art's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10399/racing-destruction-set/\">Racing Destruction Set</a> in 1985, with the latter being the larger influence. It is a precursor to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Rock+'n+Roll+Racing\">Rock 'n Roll Racing</a>, which was done by the same developer.</p>\n<p>Combat, obstacles, and traction on the non-flat tracks play a significant role. There are 3 vehicle types to choose from that perform differently on pavement, dirt, ice, flat or bumpy tracks. Cars can be armed with oil, nitro, and mines. Additionally, there are 3 levels of tires, engines, shocks, and armor.</p>\n<p>There are full race season, single race, and custom track modes. In 1 player games, the 2nd player is replaced with one of 8 AI opponents who are each associated with their own vehicle. There are 128 total tracks in this game.</p>\n<p>In season mode, each track has an entrance fee and cash prize for placing 1st; often lesser cash prizes for lesser placements are also awarded. For an additional fee, racers can opt to move to a higher racing class (levels) where fees and prizes are bigger. Each class has its own set of tracks that the player may choose from. No track is mandatory or unavailable within a class. The player also has the option of going back to a lower class for free, which may become necessary if funds are eaten up be fees without winning prizes. However, going up always incurs a fee, even if the player has been there before.</p>\n<p>During custom track designing, players can set the track's laps, gravity, and starting line type. Each track section can be pavement, dirt, or ice. Track sections are laid out like puzzle pieces on a 2D non-isometric grid (Pipe-Mania style). Sections include horizontal and vertical straights, four standard 90\u00b0 turns, eight T-sections for diverging and converging multiple paths in any direction, and a criss-cross. Either a horizontal or vertical special straight section is used as the starting grid.</p>",

Along with his sidekick Mo Crash and even more importantly his six-gun he will try to accomplish this task.</p>\n<p>The game takes place over a week with each day being a different stage. Stages are broken down into 4 parts. The first part is a training section where players can practice shooting. The next two parts are action scenes. In the action scenes, gameplay consists of moving a cross-hair over various enemies and shooting them. The final part ends the day with a showdown. The showdown involves a one on one duel in which a draw icon will randomly pop up anywhere on the screen which must be shot then immediately afterwards the enemy the player is facing then must also be shot. This continues on until either the player's or the enemy's life bar is drained.</p>\n<p>If a player doesn't shoot an energy canteen during a level a bonus screen will appear. The bonus screen shows a woman spinning around on a round board with stars next to her body. Shooting the stars without missing and without accidentally shooting the woman will help players pick up large amounts of money.</p>\n<p>At the end of a level the amount of money made is tallied up. For every bullet wasted and damage taken the player loses money. The player gains money equal to the their accuracy and the amount of energy they had left at the end of the stage.</p>",

Each event features a different vehicle to use. The player can choose from one of three vehicles which feature different attributes for handling, top speed, braking, and acceleration. The player begins by racing go-karts, then moves up to snow mobiles, then IROC racing cars, and then finally Indy racing cars. If the player places high enough in all the races, then the final challenge is to take on Al Unser, Jr. in the finals in Vancouver. </p>\n<p>In the practice mode, the player can practice every course in the game except for the final race.</p>",

Now they want to go to the GWAR concert, but they have no money for concert tickets. So in their infallible logic, they think that if they take pictures of themselves doing cool things, they will be able to get into the concert for free.</p>\n<p>The game contains four main levels which are Highland High School, Streets of Highland, Highland Hospital and the Turbo Mall 2000 and the final level at the concert.</p>\n<p>The levels bring you to different parts the area, for example in the high school level, the player will roam through the halls, cafeteria, and gymnasium. At the end of each level Beavis and Butt-Head take a picture of them doing something cool, then they go couch fishing.</p>\n<p>Couch fishing involves trying to catch as much food as possible until either the time runs out or the line gets snagged. The purpose of this is to raise their health meter for the next level. </p>\n<p>The boys will pick up weapons such as paint-ball guns to take on various enemies. There is also food scattered throughout the levels that when consumed will increase health.</p>",

Players can choose their bowler's clothes, what hand they use to bowl, the spare ball and primary ball they want to use, and also the weight of the balls.</p>\n<p>The game offers practice, tournament, and league modes. Practice mode is just a quick game of bowling by yourself. In league mode, players can either compete by themselves or as a team against other bowlers. Finally, the tournament mode features six different tournaments to compete in. A short or long tournament determines the number of players that will be involved in the tourney.</p>\n<p>Before hitting the lanes, the player will be informed of the oil pattern of the lane which tells the player how the ball will react to that lane. Bowling is performed by choosing where to stand, then using the two meters that determine the amount of power and spin the ball will have when it's finally released down the lane.</p>",

Player can fish in: <em>Skywater Lake (Local Amateur)</em>, <em>Clear Lake (Amateur)</em>, <em>Murphy Lake (Pro)</em> and <em>Bluestone Lake (Super Bass)</em>, the goal of which is to catch a certain weight limit of bass before a certain time limit.</p>\n<p>There are two screens, the boating screen where players navigate a lake using the D-Pad to navigate, the \"A\" button for acceleration and the \"B\" button for reverse. The \"Y\" button is used to enter the fishing screen. There is also a fish finder on the lower part of the screen that helps the player in locating a good place to fish.</p>\n<p>When the player enters the \"fishing screen\", they can use the \"L &amp; R\" shoulder buttons to increase the distance meter, the \"X\" button brings up the lure selection screen, the \"B\" button can bring an overhead view of the location the player currently has the lure set for and the \"Y\" button brings the player back to the \"boat mode\". To cast, the player presses the \"A\" button once to start the cast meter and a pressing it again when the meter is set at a certain limit to cast it.</p>\n<p>While fishing, the player will have an overhead top-down mode of the lake, using the \"A\" button to reel in their lure and using the D-Pad to manipulate movement of the lure. Fish can be seen through the water, outlined in a light color while bigger fish are seen stationary and cast in a dark shadow. Once the player hooks the fish, a meter will show up at the bottom, showing the tension of the line, when it hits to the far right of the meter, the line will snap. The line can also be manually cut by pressing the \"A+B\" buttons together.</p>\n<p>There are eight different lures to choose from (Pencil Bait, Torpedo, Jitterbug, Frog, Crankbait, Spoon, Furry Sinker &amp; Plastic Worm) along with several different color variations to choose from and five fish to catch (Blue Gill, Rainbow Trout, Catfish, Northern Pike and the game's namesake, Bass).</p>\n<p>There are also attributes the player can have, Technique and Strength, that can be upgraded by catching more bass and progress can be kept through a password feature.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Wizard of Oz</em> is a re-telling of L. Frank Baum's classic story, strongly influenced by MGM's 1939 musical. To a lesser degree, individual levels adapt locations from the 1993 <em>Wizard of Oz</em> animated series by DIC, using settings from the series, such as Time Town.</p>\n<p>The game is a platformer that encourages exploration. The action is split into four worlds. In each of the first three worlds, the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion can be found and controlled by the player. After gaining a companion, the characters may be switched on the fly, each companion having significantly different attacks and abilities. Several of the levels require using a combination of all of these abilities to fully explore. The game also includes a variety of mini-games which gives the player a chance to play as the dog Toto as well.</p>\n<p>All levels can be revisited once passed. Doing so serves the purposes of stocking up on items and finding the Emerald City tickets, which are required to enter the final area.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The SNES game based on the film <em>Jurassic Park</em> is an action title that combines top-down and first-person perspectives.</p>\n<p>Playing as Dr. Alan Grant, the player's ultimate goal is to escape the Jurassic Park island. To reach that goal, several other tasks must be completed, including restoring power to the park and destroying a Velociraptor nest. </p>\n<p>The large game world is seen from a top-down view and can be freely explored. Some areas are not accessible from the beginning, however. To enter them, keycards must be found or some special goal be completed, like rebooting the computer system and using it to open certain gates. Dr. Grant can defend himself against the many free-roaming dinosaurs with a variety of weapons, including an electroshock gun, a shotgun, rocket launcher, gas grenade launcher and bola gun. All weapons except the electro gun require ammo to work. A radar at the bottom of the screen helps in detecting approaching dinosaurs, but will only work once the park's motion detectors have been activated.</p>\n<p>Upon entering one of the park's buildings, the game view switches to a scrolling first person perspective, reminiscent of early first person shooters like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Wolfenstein+3D\">Wolfenstein 3D</a>. Just like outside, dinosaurs lurk in the corridors, and the same guns as in the overworld map can be used to destroy them. Many buildings consist of several floors, with elevators connecting them. Some rooms are pitch black and can only be entered when in possession of night vision goggles.</p>\n<p>The game supports the SNES mouse for the first-person sections and the computer system interface.</p>",

After winning the eight races of \"Group C\", the player is then transferred to F-3000 with more advance drivers and powerful cars. The player must win another eight tracks in this division to advance to the final division, the F-1 Grand Prix itself, with the most advanced cars and the most talented drivers and to win this series the player must compete in 16 tracks. If the player does well enough, they can return to the Grand Prix division the following year with the ability to choose a new car and sponsor.</p>\n<p>The main gameplay is a basic racing game, but does not involve oval tracks such as NASCAR, but twisting and turning tracks where the player must use caution when turning on winding roads. Players can also qualify before races for a better starting spot and must make pit stops during races to replace fuel, tires and repair damage. The player can also win prize money for doing well in races to buy better parts and upgrades for their car to race better in future races. They must be careful, however, when combining parts to try and make a perfect handling car. If the player uses the wrong combination, they can have a car that handles well in turns, but is slow on long straightaways. Likewise, they can also become to fast and dangerous in turns, causing disastrous accidents.</p>\n<p>It features a battery back-up to save games and stats and also features authentic Formula One cars such as the FW14B Williams, the McLaren MP4, the Benettion B192, the F92 Ferrari among many others and also has the entire 1992 F-1 racing season.</p>",

The player picks a location to fish using an overhead map where the player is then taken to a behind the person perspective to cast their reel. Once the player casts their line, the view will change to a split screen with the original view on the top with a underwater view on the bottom to view the bait and an approaching fish.</p>\n<p>Each lake has a different criteria to meet such as a weight limit, time limit, etc., to advance to the next lake and ultimately compete in the major tournament. Players can also assemble their own set of authentic fishing gear including rods, reels, bait and various equipment. The game also boasts that the fish in the game act realistically to their real-life counterparts.</p>",

While the other versions are based on the Brian De Palma film starring Kevin Costner, this version is based on the 1993 remake of the original 1960's series that starred Robert Stack.</p>\n<p>There are five different assignments (missions) to choose from, each with their own set time limit. The first mission is set in the over the shoulder, third-person perspective in an alleyway using a shotgun to take down mobsters hiding in buildings. The second mission is a 2D side-scroller set in a warehouse where the player must defend against gangsters and pick up counterfeiting plates scattered throughout a warehouse. The third mission is a side-scrolling shooter, located on a dock, where the player uses a tommy gun to take out various bad guys scattered throughout the stage. The fourth mission is a top-down shooter located at the top of a courthouse where the player must rescue hostages while defending against various bad guys. The fifth and final mission is a first-person shooter located on the rooftops of Chicago against Al Capone himself. </p>\n<p>The story is told between missions through old-time looking newspapers that report on the success or the failure of the player's mission.</p>",

It features 700 major MLBPA players and has all 28 teams along with the complete 1994 roster, but doesn't feature an MLB license, instead the teams nicknames are omitted and team colors are altered.</p>\n<p>There are six modes to choose from: <em>Exhibition</em>, <em>Home Run Derby</em>, <em>Defense Practice</em>, <em>Playoffs</em>, <em>League</em>, that has the player compete against each team in the game in succession and <em>Game Breaker</em> which lets the player choose from 17 scenarios to win the game under certain conditions. They can also choose different Division Champion line-ups that range from 1989-1993 or All-Star Lineups from 1989-1994.</p>\n<p>The graphics of the game are presented in a cartoonish-way and the stadiums are \"authentic\", but altered to distinguish themselves from the actual MLB stadiums. The game doesn't feature a battery back-up like many other baseball games, but Series championships can be saved using passwords. Jack Buck also lends his voice talent to the game calling play-by-play commentary.</p>",

Groups of blocks will fall from the top of the screen. Match three identical blocks and bombs will drop from the top of the screen. Occasionally, a lit bomb will fall and explode, setting off any bombs it hits and causing a chain reaction. The game is over when blocks fill the screen.</p>\n<p>It is essentially a variant of the console release of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/49150/bomberman-panic-bomber/\"> Bomberman: Panic Bomber</a>, though without the time challenge mode and with several additions. Most of the stages play the same way as in the earlier version, but they now have real-world names (such as \"Jamaica\"), and dialogue between Bomberman and his opponents was added.</p>\n<p>The game features a single-player story mode and a battle mode for up to four players.</p>",

While the gameplay is similar (exploring levels to collect clues and solve the mystery), there are four different episodes for this version. While visiting the Drabwell Ranch, ghost's interrupt the festivities and the gang must find out who is behind the hauntings and why. Another adventure takes the gang to Deadman's Cove where a ghostly pirate has been scaring off tourists and it is up to Scooby and the Gang to bring it to a halt. The other two mysteries take place at a fun fair and a haunted mansion.</p>\n<p>Players can use Scooby's unique sniffing ability to find clues. Scooby also consume Scooby Snacks to reduce the fright meter. Additionally there are a series of mini-games that player can participate in such as \"Wac-A-Monster\" or \"Make a Scooby Sandwich\". The graphics are faithfully recreated to resemble the long-running Hanna Barbara series.</p>",

After they are attacked by an unknown group of enemies on both land and air, the player is tasked to root out these enemies and stop any further attacks on Coalition forces.</p>\n<p>Much like its predecessor, the gameplay is a first-person tank simulation, using radar to scout out enemy tanks and using the main turret gun to disable and kill any opposing tanks, jeeps, APCs and various other heavy weapons including SCUD missiles. If the player encounters and air resistance, they can mount their Phalanx machine gun to cut down enemy choppers.</p>\n<p>Players also have smoke screens that can temporarily make them unseen to any enemy forces, plus they can call in supply drops to replenish their armor and ammo as well as air support that can level any opposing force in their wake.</p>",

The game is divided into two main gameplay modes, <em>Movement</em> and Battle. <em>Movement</em> has the player travel through the city using the D-pad and a map located on the bottom of the screen with the objective being to destroy certain objectives such as enemy humans and buildings as well as pick up power-ups. There is an animation in the screen above the map that shows the results of their movements and attacks.</p>\n<p><em>Battle</em> mode kicks in when the player locates an enemy on the map, like Biollante or Mechagodzilla, and is taken to a side-scrolling cinematic-style battle where the player must use punches, tail whips and the famous fire breath to drain the energy of the opposing monster. However, the <em>Fighting Spirit</em> system is present which is in a sense a morality meter where the player must pick the right attacks at the right time in order to connect certain attacks. Choosing the wrong attacks or failing to connect with them will cause the meter to drop and make Godzilla more vulnerable to attack.</p>",

Once the player finds a suitable spot, they then can cast their lure and attempt to catch as many fish as possible, but also avoid snagging their lines or make them to tight and snap from the tension.</p>\n<p>Players must also contend with changing weather conditions that can either help or hinder their time out on the lake and fish will react true to their real-life counterparts. It also features a license from TNN (The Nashville Network).</p>",

Fat Point awards players different points by what kind of shot they scored the goal with).</p>\n<p>There are six different environments to choose from ranging from empty swimming pools to construction sites filled with various obstacles that can stop the player dead in their tracks, but also has ramps so players can avoid the obstacles. It also features multiplayer capabilities using an adapter to allow four friends to compete head-to-head.</p>",

Players take pieces of a jigsaw and fit them into the proper outlines on the puzzle to form a picture. Players can compete in the <em>Jigsaw Mode</em> which allows up to five friends to compete against each other, by taking turns, in a race against time depending upon the difficulty setting (four total). Players can also compete against the computer, complete with power-ups that can help the player such as \"Sweeper\" which takes away half of their opponents completed puzzle. There are eight different categories of puzzles to choose from ranging from sports themes to global locations, each with eight puzzles ranging from 36 to 60 pieces in size.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Nickelodeon GUTS</em> is based off of the Nickelodeon TV show in the late 90's that is basically American Gladiators for kids. The events in the game are based off of the actual game show events with the main goal being to score as many points as possible while trying to beat the clock.</p>\n<p>In <strong>Elastic Sports</strong>, the player is strapped onto a long bungee cord and is bounced around. There are three events: <em>Slam Dunk</em> is a basketball game, <em>Attack</em> is lacrosse and <em>Spiral</em> where the objective is to throw a football through a hanging tire.</p>\n<p><strong>Action Sports</strong> is an obstacle course which someone would find at a boot camp and is divided into two events: <em>Basic Training</em> involves poles, swinging ropes and punching bags and <em>Tornado Run</em> which adds water jets and moving platforms. Players can also pick up bonus items that will add time or replenish health and a chance at the bonus round.</p>\n<p>The final event is the <strong>Aggro Crag</strong> which is a giant indoor mountain the player must climb while avoiding various obstacles such as confetti cannons, moving platforms and smoke vents. The goal of this event is to navigate the mountain and activate five different sensors located on the mountain before being able to activate the last one at the very top of the mountain.</p>\n<p>There is also an option for two friends to compete either head-to-head or alternating depending upon the event. Elastic lets the players compete against each other on a split-screen while Action Sports and the Aggro Crag has to be played through alternating play.</p>",

He is sent to jail to be executed, but manages to escape with the help of two former unit colleagues. The group flees through the country-side, while being pursued by imperial soldiers. On their way, they join forces with other rebels to fight against the enemy, while uncovering hidden secrets and evil plots by the Empire.</p>\n<p><em>FEDA: Emblem of Justice</em> is a strategy RPG similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6819/shining-force/\">Shining Force</a> and other titles with preset characters and linear gameplay. The player commands a party of varying size and characters with diverse skills.</p>\n<p>In the main battle sections, the player and the CPU-controlled enemy take turns moving the troops and giving orders. A menu at the bottom of the screen shows all the possible actions, where soldiers can defend, move, attack, or use an inventory item on each turn. The range of their movements and weapons vary according to their nature. A crossbow character can shoot from the back, while most sword and knife users have to be adjacent to their targets. Magic offensive powers have different ranges as well, reaching enemies that are far away from the attacking character. Health points can be recovered by eating rations or by magic, where a healer can restore points to several characters at once.</p>\n<p>Each party member has separate health and magic points, as well as other statistics like defense and attack power. They receive experience points after slaying an enemy or casting a spell, and extra points at the end of the battle. Their skills increase after surpassing 100 points.</p>\n<p>The map screen shows the party and groups of enemies traveling through the landscape in turns. The menu has options for moving the group or camping. In the encampment, one of the characters around the fire pit saves the game, while another inside the tent provides system options to change the interface color, adjust sound volume and rename the party members.</p>\n<p>In some locations like temples, villages and towns, the party has to explore the place and talk to the citizens to move on to the next section. In later battles, the player has to make a moral choice about attacking mutated humans. At the end of each battle, the party is assigned a dark or light emblem, and certain party members choose to leave or stay in the group based on its alignment.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Sasami is kidnapped by a mysterious little girl with magical powers, and Tenchi and his companions must travel to rescue her, battling monsters and other creatures on the way.</p>\n<p><em>Tenchi Muy\u014d! Game-hen</em> is a strategy game with RPG elements, based on the popular Japanese <em>Tenchi Muyo!</em> cartoon series. The game moves from battle to battle, with the plot being revealed through cutscenes between them. The player fights the computer on turns, controlling the individuals from a party of four. The party members are selected on a separate screen before each battle, and as the game progresses new characters become available.</p>\n<p>During the skirmish, selecting the characters brings up a menu with three command options: move, attack or end turn. A fourth transform option becomes available later, after they reach a higher level. When moving or attacking, glowing tiles on the ground show the maximum range of the action. Performing either one costs action points, shown as eight regenerating green dots on the status window, alongside basic statistics like health, defense and attack levels. Characters level up automatically while on the battlefield, increasing their abilities and receiving more powerful attacks. Health powers are also accessed through the attack menu, recovering lost points to an ailing comrade within their range. Characters can transform to a more powerful version when they have the ability to do so, and all the eight green dots are still available. The transformed unit has more powerful attacks and a wider range of movement.</p>\n<p>After the battle, a map screen appears where the player can save the game, and choose the next battle from one of the available paths. It is possible to revisit battlegrounds, to level up before tackling stronger enemies.</p>",

You start as the dimwitted cat Stimpy who has to search through the different levels of a firehouse to find these objects to proceed: a helmet, hose, pair of socks, rope, trampoline, uniform, and a beaver(!).  They all have to be placed on a fire truck before time runs out.  You can jump, climb up stairs and firepoles, and grab items while avoiding or putting out fires with water and eluding a speedy fireman by painting yourself like a dalmatian to avoid getting thrown out. </p>\n<p>A short 30 second bonus round follows where you must find Ren, the psychotic chihuahua.  This is followed by another 30 second round to bounce as many bags of Gritty Kitty Litter into a bin as you can.</p>\n<p>The second level has both Ren and Stimpy holding the trampoline to catch objects falling from a burning building.  Again, there is a time limit by which all items must be caught.  If successful, you return to the firehouse again the next day and must survive a week to gain the award of the Sacred Golden Fire Hydrant Helmets.</p>",

Most levels present Batman with a large number of henchmen to take out and environmental dangers to avoid on his way to one or more boss battles, but some deviate from the norm. For instance, Catwoman's stage is a large chase over Gotham City's rooftops with no enemies besides Catwoman herself. In the Penguin's level, Batman must navigate the dark corridors of Gotham City's museum, rescuing the staff. Two-Face's level is a driving sequence, seen from a top-down perspective.</p>\n<p>Besides kicks, throws and punches, Batman can use a variety of equipment against the enemies. Always available are Batarangs and the grappling hook. Before each mission, Batman can also select additional equipment, like knockout gas spray, throwing stars, smoke bombs and plastic explosives, all with limited ammunition. Special equipment required for certain levels include a flashlight, gas mask and X-ray goggles. If some necessary equipment is missing, it is always possible to return to the Batcave to change the gear and then restart the current level.</p>\n<p>Many of the situations and environments of the levels are based on episodes from the series and the game's graphics emulate the animation and drawing style of the show.</p>",

Flaus, the priestess of Valis, is slain in battle. The hero Beld, enraged, invokes a demonic power to defeat the god. But when the battle is over, the heroes disappear...</p>\n<p>The game begins with Karla the Grey Witch, one of the Six Heroes, alone in a strange place, her powers lost. After completing Karla's scenario, the player is taken to the scenarios of the other heroes, and finally finds out what happened to all of them.</p>\n<p><em>Record of Lodoss War</em> is a Japanese-style RPG with top-down navigation, world map, and randomly appearing enemies. However, the battles have a strategic edge, allowing the characters to move on the battle field freely. The battles take place on an isometric screen. Characters can also acquire unique abilities, such as for example Karla's ability to possess bodies of other people.</p>",

The battle system remains the same, but the player has more options to customize the party AI. Also, instead of choosing locations from a menu and being able to view the world map only before major battles, the player is actually navigating the world map now, physically moving to the dots that represent locations. </p>\n<p>The remake features new musical compositions and sound effects, as well as more detailed 16-bit graphics.</p>",

One or two players can play in a exhibition game (one single match) or in a world league. The game scrolls horizontally uses mode 7 graphics to give the playing field some perspective.</p>\n<p>There are 18 countries to select from, each with different running, kicking and technical abilities. You can use 5 different formations, which are 4-4-2, 4-3-3, 3-5-2, WM and libero. You also select a team captain from 8 different characters.</p>\n<p>You can perform a foul tackle on the opponent, but when the referee is close enough to notice it you risk getting a yellow or red card. By holding down a direction after shooting the players can shoot the ball with curve effect. During the game a power-up bar is charged which can be used for special abilities. Holding down R allows you to run faster, but this slowly drains the power-up bar. With a fully charged power-up bar you can perform an unstoppable hyper shoot by pressing a special combination, and this drains the power-up bar entirely.</p>",

However, despite what the title may suggest, contained within are actually four different versions of Tetris: Tetris Classic, Familiss, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss. Tetris Classic, of course, is the basic version of the game, which comes with an endless mode and a 25-line \"standard\" mode. Familiss, as the name might suggest, is a family mode for up to four players simultaneously. Sparkliss, meanwhile, is very similar to Bombliss from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/39687/super-tetris-2-bombliss/\">Super Tetris 2</a>, only with a medieval fantasy theme and different explosion patterns. Sparkliss includes both a stage mode and a puzzle mode.</p>\n<p>The most unique mode is Magicaliss, which has never shown up on any other version of <em>Tetris</em>. In Magicaliss, pieces come in three basic colors, and by rotating the piece, the player can choose between them. Creating a line entirely out of one color will clear all blocks on the screen of that color. There are also grey pieces, which can only be cleared by creating a line made entirely from one color, which will cause all grey blocks on screen to become that color. There are also rare rainbow pieces which will act as any color. Besides these additions, the game itself is basic Tetris.</p>\n<p>Tetris Classic, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss can also be played in a two-player battle mode, besides the four-player Familiss mode.</p>",

Exhibition is the usual team vs team game, while the playoff mode has 8 teams competing to win the championship. Players can choose to turn fouls on or off and also choose how many minutes each quarter will be.</p>\n<p>The game features a vertical basketball court, with only half of the court shown at any one time.

The manga tells of the running track that will make the young hoodlum Hanamichi Sakuragi who joined the basketball club in Shohoku high school just because initially interested in the sister of the captain Akagi but later this sport will conquer him so much that he becomes a real basketman.</p>\n<p>The game is essentially an arcade sports title basketball basically. The main screen there will be little choice given the presence of only three modes: Story mode and classic friendly tournament. In the first we follow the events of the television series whose plot differs slightly from the original one: using Shohoku then we will qualify for the national championship. The second and third but I think there is a need for further explanation.</p>\n<p>Executable field operations would also be different, you can also feint shots and blow up their opponents markers. Then successfully accumulating a sequence of 'affirmative action' row (steps succeeded, baskets made or avoided), will fill a horizontal bar at the top of the screen and, as he did a little 'in the playroom with the SNK Street Hoop, pressing simultaneously the three keys will not dorsal (except B), you can make a super nice shooting with supplemental animations depending on the player used.</p>",

The player takes the role of Pugsley who gets challenged to a scavenger hunt by his sister Wednesday. He has to retrieve six items which are of course hidden in six levels which can be accessed in any order. The gameplay follows the usual platforming standards: Pugsley moves from left to right while jumping a lot, avoiding enemies and sometimes solving switch puzzles. Pugsley can take three hits before dying but if he collects enough dollar symbols he can replenish his health.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Sparkster</em> is a 2D side-scrolling platformer starring the eponymous hero who previously appeared in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7397/rocket-knight-adventures/\">Rocket Knight Adventures</a>. It is very different from the contemporary Genesis title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/14430/sparkster/\">Sparkster</a>, as it does not continue the story from the first game and has completely different levels, enemies and gameplay mechanics. In that way it can be considered a spin-off in the series. The introduction merely shows how an elderly man captures a girl and takes her into his airship. At that point Sparkster appears and he decides to chase them.</p>\n<p>Sparkster is an opossum (marsupial) carrying a rocket pack on his back. He can move around, duck, jump and hang from branches or rails. His regular attack is a sword slash that sends out a circular projectile. Through the L and R buttons he can dash left and right in a circle of fire. Keeping the attack button pressed powers up a rocket meter. When full, different types or actions can be performed: dashing left, right or up to cover a large distance, ricocheting off walls in a diagonal motion, or a stationary attack.</p>\n<p>The game consists of nine levels of which the last two can only be accessed on higher difficulty levels. Sparkster collects diamonds for points, defeats all types of robot enemies and collects apples to restore his heart meter near the top of the screen. Most of the game consists of regular platforming gameplay, with a few diversions where Sparkster rides a robot bird, or is shown from a top-down view flying in the air like a vertically-scrolling shooter. All levels have a level boss along with a large number of mid-level bosses. The game supports a password system.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The legend of the Valkyrie pilots is not yet over. Hikaru, Max, and Millia take flight to defend the earth from Zentraedi, robots, more robots, and giant space crab-bees. Now is the time to scramble Valkyrie again. </p>\n<p>When starting a game or continuing the player picks from either Hikaru, Max, or Millia. Each flies a custom Valkyrie with its own set weapon load-out. A Valkyrie changes its weapon and movement speed by switching between its three forms: Fighter, Gerwalk, and Battroid. Typically the Valkyrie weapon shoots straight and quickly, the Gerwalk weapon shoots around or through obstacles, and the Battroid weapon does higher damage in exchange for reduced firing rate. Each weapon can be upgraded up to twice by picking up power up items dropped by special enemy ships, but one level of power up will be lost any time the Valkyrie is shot. If a Valkyrie's entire life bar is depleted then the full stage must be repeated, provided the player still has enough continues.</p>\n<p>In a nod to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8402/galaga/\">Galaga</a> the player is able to capture some enemy craft to increase their firepower. If the player does not shoot any weapons for a few seconds a field of electricity will cover the Valkyrie. Touching some enemy ships will then cause their targeting to be shorted out and make them friendly to the player, following along and shooting or ramming onscreen enemies.</p>",

Unlike its predecessor which uses an isometric top-down view of a single-screen track, this arcade racing game is made specifically for the SNES and uses its Mode 7 hardware for a 3D racing experience with a 3rd person perspective.</p>\n<p>The game has three different tournaments, the Mexico 250, Ensenada 500 and Baja 1000. Instead of having to drive many consecutive rounds on a small circuit the circuits are big and more akin to rally racing with a finish at a different location than the start. The game is still held with many opponents as well as non participating traffic and wildlife that can hinder the player or be ruthlessly run over. Along the bumpy off-road tracks the player can collect bags of money, just like in its predecessor. Money can be spend on improvements of various of the car's parts, such as: brakes, tires, shocks, lights, engine and nitros.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Restoring the lands from evil, saving the princess, and finding a way back home might not be the most original of goals; but this game also includes comedy stylings of the Japanese performance group Dach\u014d (Ostrich) Club to complement the traditional storytelling.</p>\n<p><em>Zig Zag Cat</em> is a somewhat unusual fusion of <em>Breakout</em> and a scrolling shooter. During action stages the player's avatar walks forward while attempting to keep their cat from bouncing off the bottom of the screen. The cat can break most obstacles by hitting them, and all obstacles will be broken if they collide with the avatar. By breaking blocks money and temporary paddle upgrades can be uncovered, such as ones that increase the size or the paddle, let you fire bullets, or allow you to curve the cat while it is moving. Several times during each stage a black octopus block will appear, and it must be destroyed by the cat before the player's avatar will continue moving forward. While the avatar is totally unharmed from walking through any enemies or blocks, some enemies and all bosses have the ability to fire projectiles at him which do cause damage, and if all health is lost from projectiles then a life will be lost just as if the cat had fallen off the screen.</p>\n<p>In between action stages the player will enter an Inn. At the Inn he can save, talk to the locals, play a bonus board to earn additional money, buy temporary paddle upgrades, and check his progress on his trip around the island.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Uch\u016b no Kishi: Tekkaman Blade's</em> is based on the anime <em>Tekkaman Blade</em>, also known as <em>Teknoman</em>. The game's levels are a mix of scrolling shooter and fighting game. The first part of every level is a scrolling shooter where Tekkaman Blade must survive several waves of Radam before killing two stronger boss-like Radam and meeting another Tekkaman. In scrolling shooter levels Blade can either toss his spear to defeat enemies at range or quickly slash with it to destroy bullets and enemies. One enemy type will drop different colored System Box powerups: green restores health, red destroys all enemies onscreen (except bosses), and blue turns Blade invulnerable and able to destroy all enemies upon contact (including bosses).</p>\n<p>The end of every level is a one on one fight with an enemy Tekkaman. Each Tekkaman starts with a weapon, but the weapon will be lost if they take too much damage, forcing them to use punches and kicks. This mode can also be played in 2-player mode, where each player selects their Tekkaman.</p>",

The hovercraft has the ability to accelerate, reverse, track the hoverball, and it can also fire at the opposing player to make him drop the ball if he's carrying it. If the player's hovercraft picks up the hoverball, they must try to get to the touchdown area within four seconds or else the hoverball gets automatically fumbled. Each game is played for a duration of 500 time units and the player with the highest score when the time runs out is declared the winner.</p>\n<p>The playfield itself presents features that can affect the way the match is played. Some playfields contain things such as jumps, spinners, and force arrows which can help or hinder a players movement. </p>\n<p>There are a total of 12 drivers to choose from, with 4 per every speed level (slow, medium, and high).</p>",

Galivan and company don't have time to find items or level up weapons as in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Cosmo+Police+Galivan\">Galivan's previous outing</a>; this is a no holds barred slugfest. Three characters are playable, each with varying stats but basically the same moveset. Each character has a standard straight ahead punch or kick, a sweeping kick, an uppercut, and a ranged attack that must be charged up. At the start of the game and the end of every level the player can add stat points to their character to increase their HP, defense, jump height, and strength of normal and special attacks.</p>\n<p>A 2 player versus mode is included as well. Both players can choose from the three main characters, and the second player can additionally choose from one of the four normal enemy types.</p>",

Chiaki has a vision of five cloaked figures and knows that only she and Zenki can stop them. At once they set off to track down the demon leaders.</p>\n<p>In <em>Kishin Douji ZENKI: Battle Raiden</em> the player takes the role of Zenki. At first, and occasionally through the game, Zenki will be in his powered down form where he can only punch, jump, and dash. After Chiaki recovers her bracelet, or regains her concentration, or whatever she needs to do at the time, she can transform Zenki into his powered up form. In this form Zenki deals more damage and has a much longer list of attacks that get added to as the game progresses, such as a pillar of energy, an electrified punch, and a dashing attack. By picking up scrolls Zenki can do a powerful Rudora attack to all enemies on screen, but this attack damages Zenki as well.</p>\n<p>To complete platforming levels Zenki will have to make it to the end of the level while occasionally finding hidden stone monuments that, when destroyed, will drop items as well as alter the level or remove obstacles, allowing Zenki to pass. After a stage's first platforming level is a midboss fight, and after the second platforming level is the boss fight proper.</p>",

Your avatar attacks by slashing to the right with his energy sword, and he can also hold his sword defensively to deflect some bullets. By then holding forward and releasing attack he can throw the sword like a boomerang. He can also jump. A bomb follows the avatar around on any on-foot level that can be used to destroy all enemies onscreen at any time, and it will be replaced whenever a life is lost. Environments range from city streets to sewers and a flying battleship. Each level ends with a boss fight against an enemy that can withstand many attacks.</p>",

Each Episode starts with an introduction by \"Oyassan\" Tachibana, and stars a different Rider with his own unique special move. Episodes are broken up into six levels of combat against several Shockers riding their own motorcycles or cars or other vehicles, followed by a boss battle in the seventh level. After levels 2 and 5 the Kamen Rider will repair any damage and be able to choose from one of 4 limited powerups, such as invincibility, super speed, or a machine gun. Most of the time Kamen Rider will defeat enemies by riding alongside them and punching them, and enemies will try to do the same to ram or shoot him.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Battle Grand Prix</em> is a Formula One racing game in which one or two players can pit themselves in 3 Grand Prix races. The players can pick from 40 fictional drivers and 24 teams to play with. The game is always shown in split-screen mode, even when the player is playing on his own, in this case the opponent directly behind or ahead of the player is shown in the other window. Car settings can be adjusted in the garage. Pit-stops can be used to repair the car during a race. Crashing the car can also force the player to retire from the race early.</p>\n<p>In the game the player can choose from four game modes:* Survival - Finish at or lower than a certain position (determined by your difficulty) to continue to the next race</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Champion</li>\n<li>VS</li>\n<li>Slot - In this game mode steering happens automatically. The only thing the players need to concern themselves with is the gas and break pedals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The game features three difficulty levels: Beginner, Pro and Expert.</p>",

At the start of the game the player can choose from Red Jack, Silver Jack, or Blue Jack. Red and Silver both have weapons they can find ammo for in levels (a gun and baton, respectively), and all three can do a multiple hit combo or a jumping attack. At the end of a level the Jack will be met by his vehicle which will then merge with his armor. In this form the Jack's attacks are strengthened and he can charge up an attack that hits every enemy onscreen.</p>\n<p>There is no story told at any point in the game, so if you want to know what's going on you'll have to track down the anime.</p>",

The angel Tenshi is still determined to end Ackman's nefarious ways, and this time he has enlisted the help of the angelic rock band Metal Angel. Ackman still murders at whim and has his companion Godon collect the souls of his slain, but this time Ackman can keep the weapons he finds, either sword, boomerang, or gun. Each weapon can be upgraded twice, but upgrades will be lost if Ackman is hit or finds a new weapon. Ackman can also now throw smaller enemies, although he can't move while holding them.</p>\n<p><em>Ackman 2</em> takes place over 5 stages filled with new bosses and enemies.</p>",

Who's really pulling the strings here? And, most importantly, does Ackman care about any of this at all?</p>\n<p>The last of the <em>Ackman</em> games, <em>Go Go Ackman 3</em> makes very few changes from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/47862/go-go-ackman-2/\">Go Go Ackman 2</a>, although Tenshi is now a playable character. Both Ackman and Tenshi can be switched between at special points in a level, but they share the same health meter and weapon. Unlike Ackman Tenshi can fly, but as he is an angel he can not collect the souls of enemies he kills. Souls have changed too, and are now used as currency in shops where Ackman can buy temporary powerups or healing. Finally Ackman has lost the ability to slide enemies along the ground, but he can now move while holding a stunned enemy.</p>",

Now it's time to pay them back, with interest.</p>\n<p><em>Gekitotsu Dangan Jid\u014dsha Kessen: Battle Mobile</em> plays similarly to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7668/spy-hunter/\">Spy Hunter</a> in both perspective and objective, but your car in <em>Battle Mobile</em> isn't quite as high tech an instrument as that other game's vehicle. You can launch unlimited missiles, but they can only hit helicopters. For ground based targets you must dash into them to ram them off the road. Your car's health is constantly dwindling, even when you're not being attacked by enemies, so picking up the occasionally appearing energy refill items is essential. Shields can be picked up and stored that will make your car invulnerable to all damage for a short while.</p>",

By gobbling up their competition, and with the help of new weapons technology, CONEX is on the cusp of controlling the world. Only a hero from the last war can defy them and stop their plans of conquest.</p>\n<p><em>Genocide 2</em> is a modified version of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/54773/genocide-2-master-of-the-dark-communion/\">PC release</a>. The player takes control of a ten meter tall robotic ninja: the Tracer. Its only form of attack is a sword, but it can hold several extra weapons, and always has access to the Betty. The Betty can be fired in eight directions, returns to the Tracer after being fired, and can block enemy bullets. The objective of each stage is to reach the end, and some stages require you to destroy targets along the way. Any items picked up by the player, or damage done to the Tracer, carries over between stages, and each stage records your fastest time for beating them.</p>\n<p>Aside from the visual downgrade, <em>Genocide 2</em> also lost many minor enemy types and one mid-boss in the transition to the Super Famicom. The first stage was removed, and the first two levels of stage 2 were reversed. The Betty now can only be used for a limited time, and must recharge when its time has run out.</p>",

It seems the kindly old storekeeper Yakuchin found a magic statue and figured it would best be kept in Mikami's hands. Of course, where there's magic, there's wealth (or something like that), so Reiko sets out to find the seven gems needed to complete the statue.</p>\n<p><em>GS Mikami: Joreishi wa Nice Body</em> is a side scrolling platform game based on the <em>Ghost Sweeper Mikami</em> manga and anime. The player controls Reiko who can fight off ghosts and monsters with her enchanted baton. The baton can be powered up to shoot lighting or icicles at an angle, but its power is lost if Reiko is hit. Reiko can only hold up to three special weapons, either a scroll that sucks enemies into it, or a gem that freezes time. Each case in the game is either one or two platforming levels long followed by a boss fight.</p>",

In the game Taru must cross levels in five worlds to reach and defeat Raivar to save Honmaru's girlfriend Iyona. Taru can attack enemies in a level with his tongue, and he can also eat the many takoyaki scattered throughout the level. Takoyaki can also function as platforms, though, so they shouldn't all be eaten. At the end of a level Taru can use the takoyaki he's eaten to purchase temporary power ups. On the worldmap taru can run into friends and enemies who will challenge Taru to minigames. Win and he gains extra takoyaki and powerups.</p>",

Special moves deplete a regenerating energy meter, while Rocket Punches can be preformed at any time, although Mazinger will be unable to punch until its arms return. Each level contains several varieties of enemies, all of them from the show and unique to each level, that must be defeated to progress. Some enemy robots will fire projectiles from a distance while others will rush in attempt to grapple the Mazinger, and sometimes more than one enemy must be fought at once. Enemies will drop healing items and occasionally an item that upgrades Mazinger's Rocket Punch to the Iron Cutter for a limited time. At the end of each level is a fight with a stronger boss robot with more dangerous attacks.</p>",

However, the dialogues have been greatly reduced and/or simplified. This applies also to the size of the game's cities and other locations, the amount of items to pick up, interior details, etc.</p>\n<p>Combat also underwent significant changes. The battles in this version are action-based; the player has to click on the enemy repeatedly to win. Unlike the PC version with its party management, the Avatar is traveling and fighting solo in this release.</p>",

Her brother Lord Maliss, who can take the form of a dragon, changes Snow White's Prince into a monster Shadow Man.  You can play as Snow White or Shadow Man and must go through eight levels full of platform obstacles and enemies to free the kingdom from his evil sorcery.  This side-scrolling platformer is based on an animated movie by Filmation released in 1993.  </p>\n<p>You collect fruit and stars through each level and can jump on some enemies or throw apples at them (which are also used to break through blocks). Be careful as you jump on platforms as going too close to the edge can cause you to lose balance and fall.  On the screen, your health is shown by a heart.  If you get hit by an enemy, fall down a pit, or fall from too high, it will decrease by one.  If it reaches zero, you lose one of three lives.  Some special attacks can be used, if possessed, like apple bombs.  Eventually a sign \"Find The Exit\" will appear and you can exit to the next level.  If you make it to the end, you must fight Maliss in dragon form.  You can change the difficulty level or choose a continuous play option as well.</p>",

The game features all the real team names and logos of that era.</p>\n<p>Exhibition mode lets the player select a team and play either another player or the computer. The player can also select a demo mode where two computer controlled teams will face off against each other. The playoff mode features 12 teams competing for a chance to win the Super Bowl.</p>\n<p>During the game, the field is mainly viewed from a horizontal perspective. Players select their plays (pass, run, or kick) and try to outscore their opponents by the time the clock runs out. After every quarter, the game updates the player to the current game statistics.</p>\n<p>Options include choosing whether to use standard or team specific playbooks, setting the quarter length (5, 10, or 15 minutes), and setting the weather conditions. The game also features a voice that announces key events like first downs and timeouts that can be turned off if the player desires it so.</p>",

The game carries the MLBPA license, but not an MLB license, so it only features all the players from the 1991 season playing for a team in a city that they really play for. Players get to play in either a dome, modern, or traditional stadium each with their own unique characteristics.</p>\n<p>The 1 and 2 player mode lets the player play an exhibition game against the computer or another player. League mode lets the player play through a season of games against computer controlled teams.</p>\n<p>Pitching and batting are done from a behind the batter viewpoint. When batting players can sub in a pinch hitter and when on base, a pinch runner, and when pitching can call in a relief pitcher from the bullpen. </p>\n<p>Game options include setting the number of innings (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9), turning errors on or off, and turning the called game option on or off.</p>",

Players go toe to toe with their opponents in the boxing ring in 3 minute rounds. The boxers can throw hooks and jabs at each other with the sole intention to knock their opponent down to the canvas by draining all their energy by landing those punches. Each punch thrown costs the boxer some stamina which is indicated by boxing glove icons. If all the boxers stamina is drained, they can no longer throw punches for a little while until they gain some of their stamina back. After each fight is over, players go to the gym to train in various different exercises like skipping rope and bench pressing weights.

        "description": "<p>An updated version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Golden+Fighter+-+Hiryu+No+Ken+S\">Hiryu no Ken S: Golden Fighter</a> which adds a choice of turbo speed levels to increase the speed of the combat.</p>\n<p>In the Story mode, the main storyline involves a demon named Dargon who has been revived with the sole intent to destroy the Flying Warriors, who are a team of superheroes. Dargon sent in his Tusk Soldiers to raid Shorinji and they ended up stealing the secret scroll of Hiryu-no-ken and a sacred sword. They also offer a challenge to anyone who wants to reclaim these artifacts, that they would have to have a showdown at the World Tournament. It is now up to Rick to enter this fighting tournament and win back these priceless artifacts.</p>\n<p>During story mode, players control Rick in a side scrolling beat 'em up. Occasionally one one one boss battles will occur. Players will also be able to find healing items called miracle water which will restore depleted health.</p>\n<p>In the VS. Tournament mode, up to 8 players can fight each or computer opponents in one on one battles to win a tournament. Players can choose to play as one of twelve fighters, each with their own special martial arts technique. Options include setting the turbo mode speed, turning on or off cosmic saucer (knocking the opponent out of the ring), the time limit of a round of fighting (1, 3, or 5 minutes, or no time limit at all), and the level of a handicap to put on a fighter.</p>\n<p>In the Battle mode, players get to fight a one on one battle against a computer controlled boss opponent of their choice.</p>\n<p>The Animation mode plays out similar to the Story mode except when it comes to the boss battles. Boss battles in this mode turn into turn based affairs. Players can select from different attack and defensive moves, or can even have the computer fight their battle automatically.</p>\n<p>The game also has two different fight control settings. The Fighting option is how most fighting games are controlled while Expert involves target circles appearing on the player and the opponent during a fight. Players have to attack where the target circles are on their opponent and defend against attacks when the target circles are their own body. There are also 8 difficulty levels for the player to choose from.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Like the other adaptations of the 1967 Disney animated film <em>The Jungle Book</em>, the SNES version is a side-scrolling platformer starring Mowgli, the young boy raised by wolves in the jungle. Running, jumping, climbing, and swinging on vines, he must make his way through 11 levels. These includes the jungle by day and by night, a village high in the trees, a waterfall, ape King Louie's realm and the wasteland charred by a fire.</p>\n<p>The jungle is full of dangerous animals, like bugs, snakes, anteaters and monkeys, which Mowgli can defeat by jumping on their heads or throwing bananas (from an unlimited supply) at them. Some jungle fruit like mangoes and coconuts can also be collected and used as weapons. Other power-ups include hearts (some of them hidden in fruit) that refill Mowgli's health bar, extra lives, masks that trigger invincibility and two kinds of gems: red gems count towards extra continues at the end of a level, while green gems count toward a special ending of the game.</p>\n<p>Some variety from the standard platforming comes into play in two automatically scrolling levels: once when Mowgli rides a parrot and once when he escapes from the collapsing ruins of Louie's castle. Several levels end in boss fights, featuring Kaa the snake, King Louie the orangutan and Shere Khan the tiger.</p>",

New to the series is the ability to run and a longer health bar represented by hearts (a single shuriken doesn't kill the player anymore). Hearts can be collected to add more health. When the ninja dies, he is resurrected on the spot. Ninja also collects souls of slain enemies to fill his soul gauge. When the gauge is filled, Ninja can unleash one of his super powers. </p>\n<p>The game contains a total of 9 stages with a boss battle at the end of each one.</p>\n<p>The game also features a simultaneous two-player mode, the second player being a palette swap of Ninja-kun.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This adaptation of the animated TV series differs significantly from its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/12575/james-bond-jr/\">NES namesake</a>. The nephew of Agent 007 must foil the plans of malevolent S.C.U.M. agents, who are hunting for rare artifacts that would allow them to dominate the world. Unlike the NES game, this version is a more action-oriented side-scrolling game without detailed mission objectives or puzzle-solving.</p>\n<p>The game consists of three levels, each beginning with a section in which Bond pilots a helicopter, a boat, and a jet, respectively. These are controlled in arcade-like fashion, similarly to side-scrolling shooters. Enemies must be dealt with using weapons mounted on the craft. Various hazards are scattered through the stages, requiring the player to react quickly in order to stay alive.</p>",

        "description": "<p>King Geoffrey of Kyliria has recently passed away.  Jerry, his eldest son, was all set to take the throne, however his younger brother Tom was overcome with jealously and hired an evil wizard to kidnap Jerry's wife, and also turn his brother Jerry into a gelatinous ball. Now Tom will be able to rule over Kyliria unopposed. Players take on the role of the now transformed Jerry who is out to take back his kingdom and his wife, and of course regain his human form. </p>\n<p>The game involves going through 8 stages (broken up into two parts each) of side-scrolling action. At the end of each stage is a boss monster that must be disposed of.</p>\n<p>Jerry moves by sliding across the ground and can latch on to walls and climb them. Jerry can also jump, stretch out to cling to ceilings, and also move at a faster pace. Jerry can consume balls that he finds during a stage and can then fire them out of his body at enemies blocking his path. Enemies can also be defeated by jumping on them and then flattening Jerry's body on them. Also, there are flowers that contain items for Jerry to collect. Items include life, which refills health, a 1-up that adds an extra life, and a seed, which will grow a climbable beanstalk when planted. If the player collects the scattered letters that appear in every stage that spell out the name Jerry, the player will earn two extra lives.</p>\n<p>The Japanese version of this game contains towns in between levels, where the player has the option to speak with townspeople to move the storyline along. This element of the game was removed when it was later released in North America.</p>",

Here you also have to collect some fruits (100 nuts, to be more accurate) to earn a extra life. The sprites of the characters are in the anime style, giving emphasis on the main character and the bosses. During the game you be able to swing on the jungle vines, fight evil army soldiers - with kicks and punches - and battle a boss at the end of each level. Sometimes you will get some help from your friends, like Cheetah, and some other jungle animals.</p>",

Like in the previous games, the player controls an eighteen-year-old Japanese boy who aspires to become the best street race driver. In the beginning of the story mode the player has to complete driving tests, which include a written examination. Afterwards, the protagonist has to become acquainted with the the racing community, participate in street race, as well as purchase car parts and entire vehicles. Part-time jobs involve the familiar security guard assignments, which play like mini-RPGs. The navigation in this installment is top-down, while battle screens are isometric. The versus mode allows up to four players to race against each other or computer AI.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Zero4 Champ RRZ</em> is a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Zero4+Champ+RR\">Zero4 Champ RR</a>, and the fourth installment in the Zero4 Champ series. The protagonist of the previous game has become the street racing champion of his city, but was later humiliated by the crowd because he lost an unimportant race. Offended, the hero moves to another city and decides to build up his career from scratch.</p>\n<p>Like the previous entries in the series, the game contains a story mode and a versus mode, adding to those a \"mini-story mode\", in which the player drives some of the best cars in the game in unique scenarios (one of which, for example, involves traveling to the past and racing there in a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=back+to+the+future\">Back to the Future</a> style). The story mode involves buying new cars, customizing them with parts, and winning races to earn money and gain access to better vehicles. Various mini-games are available by selecting locations on the city map, such as for example playing pachinko slot machines to earn money, etc.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In 3017, when Herras Ragen was 12, his father Colonel Joseph T. Ragen, a soldier in the House Davion army, was working to infiltrate and destroy a renegade mercenary cartel called the Dark Wing Lance. However, he was discovered, and the Dark Wing took their revenge: somehow, they had learned the location of the Ragen family's residence. Under cover of night they attacked, killing everyone. Only young Herras, who was at a friend's house at the time of the massacre, survived. Unbeknownst to him, the Dark Wing made an agreement that after the strike, they would separate for ten years and maintain an absolute code of secrecy before regrouping again to continue their nefarious operations.</p>\n<p>Now, in 3027, that time is up. Herras, who has become a young man, has waited the last decade for his chance to take revenge. As a mercenary MechWarrior operating from the planet Galatea, with a light 'Mech in the hangar and 50.000 C-Bills in the bank, he will accept any mission that will lead him closer to finding the murderers of his family.</p>\n<p><em>MechWarrior</em> on the SNES, while broadly similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/105/mechwarrior/\">PC game of the same name</a>, puts the player into the BattleTech universe with a new story, and gameplay and controls suited to the console. </p>\n<p>The central hub in the game is Galatea. Here, Herras can visit Club Zero-Zero (for the latest news, rumors and gossip), General HeadQuarters (for mission assignments) and the 'Mech Complex (for buying, selling, repairing and customizing 'Mechs). In the club, bartender Cearle usually has some helpful advice, and other characters may also offer tips and give pointers to certain assignments that will lead Herras further in his quest. He can also view Holovids left to him by other characters as well as check out bulletins from NewsNet.</p>\n<p>At GHQ, several missions will be available at any point in the game, not all of which advance the storyline: many are entirely optional. Before accepting an assignment, the mission parameters can be studied: they include the mission type, the size of expected resistance as well as environmental conditions, like planet climate and gravity. The possible mission types are Garrison and Riot Duty (destroy all enemy 'Mechs), Recon and Objective Raids (locate and collect a specific item carried by an enemy 'Mech), Planetary Assault and Offensive Campaign (stop the enemy from entering a friendly base), Security Duty (protect a base from being overrun - from inside the site) and Siege Campaign (locate and destroy an enemy base). Before each mission, the reward for successful completion can be negotiated - often something higher than the basic offer can be reached, but asking for too much might also offend House Davion.</p>\n<p>During an actual mission, gameplay is seen from a first-person cockpit perspective, with the SNES' Mode 7 employed for a pseudo-3d effect. Specific parts of enemy 'Mechs (torso, arms and legs) can be targeted, with expected effects: losing arms also loses weapons, while damaged legs hinder movement.</p>\n<p>Earned C-Bills can be spent in the 'Mech Complex for repairs or new acquisitions. Eight different BattleMechs are available to buy and sell: four light, two medium, one heavy and one assault 'Mech, all entirely new designs not seen in the BattleTech tabletop games. The machines can be equipped with loads of different weapons: guided and unguided missiles, machine guns, lasers, and the mighty particle cannon. Missiles and energy guns build up heat with every shot: to prevent overheating, heat sinks should be installed - the problem is less pronounced on colder planets, naturally. Also available are more than a dozen different engines, as well as armor plates and jump jets (which have a much stronger effect on low-gravity planets).</p>\n<p>There are various paths through the game, depending on choices taken by the player on which assignments to handle. All in all, more than 50 storyline missions plus many optional ones await.</p>",

It is possible to customize names, numbers, uniforms, and faces of the players (including detailed options for facial features). Practice mode has been expanded as well, allowing training of separate players. Core gameplay mechanics remain the same as in the previous installments.

The sequel also features rudimentary character creation, allowing the player to choose the gender and a portrait of the player characters. </p>\n<p>The character roster has been expanded and modified to include other types of characters rather than famous warlords such as Caesar and Napoleon.

        "description": "<p><em>Dirt Racer</em> is a racing game which is set on five off-road courses and offers three different vehicles (truck, buggy and stock car). The player participates either in a league (three divisions with eight drivers each) or a tournament with a knock-out system (also eight participants). The races itself are always one-against-one and the winner is who has the best end time. If the player drives in the water or against another obstacle, time is lost and the car gets set back on the course - but only for a limited amount of times; after that the race is lost. The controls feature two different acceleration speeds and three different braking strengths. Up to eight players can participate in the events, but the racing itself is limited to two at the same time.</p>",

Unusually for a game of this genre, it is one-player only; the two playing modes being time trial or Grand Prix. The latter consists of 15 races, but the player needs to finish on the first, second or third place in order to reach the next.</p>",

In each turn, one player gets to lay an egg into one grid of the 9x9 playfield. When a player manages to trap a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) of an opponent's eggs, i.e. having an one egg at each end of the row, they change colour. A round is over after a certain amount of time and whoever has the most eggs on the field, wins. One match consists of several rounds. In contrast to the real board game, up to four player can participate.</p>",

As a result, each hour needed to be completed in one sitting, or the player would have to quickly catch up the next week. Each hour included two available dungeons and some non-dungeon events, and blocked off certain areas that were not to be accessed until future weeks. The map of Hyrule from the original game was also cut in half, so the game was broadcast twice, once for each map.</p>\n<p>One key difference between the original and the remake is that in BS The Legend of Zelda, the Old Man periodically sends the player telepathic hints.</p>",

The available modes are exhibition matches, tournament, league, cup and all-star (the teams are divided into two leagues and the overall winner is decided with play-offs). With the option \"You're a Hero\", the player can create a new athlete, change his stats with a few training lessons and swap it with an existing one. The player either controls the athlete who has the ball or, when in defense, the one who is nearest to it. The field is shown from a slightly angled side-perspective. During most modes, all teams can be taken over by human players, but only two can play at the same time.</p>",

But a pair of government agents are hot on both your tails! And if they catch you, who knows what they'll do to ghosts like him? You can't dwell on this much longer - you've got to protect him, and quick!</p>\n<p>Based on the movie of the same name, \"Casper\" has you as Kat collecting items (especially coins and gems) while trying to protect your namesake ghostly friend from the wrath of government agents. Kat can use baseballs to stun the agents for a while, but she better use them wisely or she'll get caught ending the game. Luckily Kat can save the game at any time by activating a series of mechanical contraptions. Saving the game keeps track of the coins and gems Kat has collected, and that total determines how much of the game you have completed. Kat can also call on Casper to see through walls and locked doors and see what lies ahead, but he can only do this for a brief time before control returns to Kat.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mario &amp; Wario</em> is a puzzle game that is compatible with the SNES Mouse. The player chooses Princess Peach (low speed), Mario (medium speed), or Yoshi (high speed), and Wario proceeds to drop a bucket on their head (the object changes in later levels) The player controls Wanda the fairy to guide the now-blinded character through an obstacle course, to reach Luigi waiting at the end. Advancement is continuous and automatic: the object on their head may be tapped to make them turn around, otherwise they'll turn after hitting a wall. Hitting a dangerous obstacle (spikes or enemies) results in losing a life. Items, such as Coins, Stars, Mushrooms, and 1-Up Mushrooms can grant 1-Ups and more time. At the end of every world, a bonus level is played where Wanda hits Wario in his plane to earn coins.</p>",

The rangers must face off against Lord Zedd's Putty Patrol (whose troops come in more than a dozen varieties), several small and one large boss per stage. Six different rangers (Red, Yellow, Blue, Pink, Black and White) are available for selection before every level. In the two-player mode, two rangers can play at the same time.</p>\n<p>The rangers begin each level in their civilian outfits and must collect power-ups from defeated enemies to slowly fill a power bar. Once that bar is full, they can transform into their ranger outfit at the press of a button, making them more resilient to damage and their attacks more powerful. Filling the power bar again allows them to use a signature weapon unique to each ranger for a limited time or perform an extra powerful special attack.</p>\n<p>The game takes place on two lanes, and at most points in the game it is possible to jump between foreground and background to get to enemies or evade obstacles. In two-player mode it is of course possible to keep each ranger on their dedicated lane and only switch if absolutely necessary.</p>",

The player controls a car and the objective is to win the race.</p>\n<p>There is a scenario campaign mode, where the player starts with a stock car, can tune it and take part in various races on highways, racing tracks and mountain roads. Drifting is a preferred way to take hard corners.</p>\n<p>As most racing games for SNES, this one heavily utilizes SNES's \"perspective polygon\" drawing mode to draw the track (which is basically a huge flat textured polygon) and overlaid sprites for objects such as cars.</p>",

It keeps the same basic gameplay of the first title -- players move around the board purchasing properties and investing in districts to earn money -- while adding a number of new elements in the form of new space types, such as heliports that will move players to distant locations on the board. There are now more than a dozen characters to choose from, and 15 different board layouts, including several based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/436/dragon-warrior-dragon-quest-series/\">Dragon Quest</a> franchise.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A game that simulates the sport of bass fishing. It offers both a practice and a tournament mode. In the tournament mode,\nplayers have to reel in some large bass, then have up to five of their largest catches weighed. Competitors are ranked by whoever brought in the heaviest haul and the player must at least rank the third heaviest during the weigh-in in order to move on to the next stage of the tournament.</p>\n<p>Practice mode lets the player fish without all the pressures of the tournament. Players can choose from one of four different U.S. lakes, with each lake having multiple spots to fish at. Players also have the option to select what month they want to fish in and pick from six different weather conditions.</p>\n<p>When out on the lake, players direct their boat to a spot where they want to cast their line. Players can also choose what lures and tackles they want to use. Then players have to use a meter that gauges how strong the line will be cast out. At that point, players finally get their chance to catch some big bass.</p>\n<p>The game features Shimano brand rods and reels and also contains advice from the champion angler <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/600943/jimmy-houston/\">Jimmy Houston</a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Shij\u014d Saiky\u014d League Serie A: Ace Striker</em> (or simply <em>Ace Striker</em>) is a football (soccer) game that features all clubs and the majority of footballers from the 1994\u201395 Serie A season.</p>\n<p>During that time, the Italian Serie A was unanimously considered the most competitive league in the world, and the Japanese fans followed it passionately. In 1994, the signing of a Japanese star player by one of the league clubs came calling even more attention and enthusiasm, hence the release of few (Japan-exclusive) soccer games based solely in the Italian football league.</p>\n<p>Playable modes presented in the game include \"Pre Match\", \"PK mode\" and \"League\". In the latter one the player has to compete in the 1994\u201395 Serie A season which consists of 34 matches.</p>\n<p>The game scrolls horizontally at a slight angle and the players' sprites are cartoony (close to super deformed style). There's only one formation available (the default one), however the player has the option to position ten of the eleven players anywhere in the field. It is also possible adjusting the tactic to normal, defensive or offensive.</p>\n<p>During the matches there is a small scanner that shows the players' positions. A cutscene (animated image) will appear whenever a goal is scored. The goal celebration will always occur and very few players have their unique way of celebrating. There is a referee which will only show up when a foul is committed and sometimes he will show the yellow and/or red card. Only two substitutions are allowed, and many other \"elements\" are missing such as fatigue, injuries or the offside law.</p>",

The Avatar also travels alone instead of being in a party of adventurers. Other changes include there being a smaller amount of items to pick up and the day and night cycle being only cosmetic instead of affecting the schedules of the NPC's.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the 1993 Formula One Season, <em>Final Stretch</em> features a GP, 1P VS 2P, and Time Attack modes. In GP mode the player can choose either beginner or expert which have many differences.</p>\n<p>At beginner any team can be chosen and the player will start all races without having to qualify. There's no machine setting, and one other difference is that during the actual race the vehicles do not collide with each other. In the expert one, there's the qualifying session consisting of nine laps. It is also possible to save data, among other differences.</p>\n<p>Only a single player is allowed to compete in the GP mode, and the screen is always split. The bottom screen shows the car in the typical chase view while the top can show up to five different views.</p>\n<p>Just like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/23137/redline-f1-racer/\">Redline: F1 Racer</a>, the game was supervised by the Japanese driver <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/232941/aguri-suzuki/\">Aguri Suzuki</a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p>It all started when an prison inmate named Joe Yabuki got into a fight with his rival and former boxing prodigy Rikiishi. Rikiishi was dominating Joe until it happened - Joe hit him with a cross-counter, knocking them both out! That's when the inmates knew that this young man was going to be someone special. After taking some lessons from a boxing trainer named Danpei (who he met before), and some time apart in the process, Joe was finally ready for the boxing world. But is the boxing world ready for Joe?</p>\n<p>Based on the critically-acclaimed Japanese manga of the same name, <em>Ashita no Joe</em> puts the player in Joe Yabuki's shoes as he battles some of his greatest opponents. Like many other boxing games of its time, the controls are simple - use one button to punch, and the other to guard. Knock him down three times, and he's down for the count. But always be on guard, because the fighters that await Joe as he climbs the ladder to Bantamweight boxing glory can get tougher and meaner!</p>\n<p>A second player can join in the melee, playing a VS mode.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Tactical Soccer</em> is a soccer game published by Electronic Arts, although it was developed by a Japanese team.</p>\n<p>Like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/65231/zico-soccer/\">Zico Soccer</a>, the gameplay is more reminiscent of a strategy game in real time. It takes place before players' eyes so the action (which is represented by a small window at the top of the screen) can't be interrupted.</p>\n<p>Each of the 16 national teams have 16 players with different skills (ranging from A to E). During a match, the player gives directions such as force at the center, play on the wings, back in defense, take a long or short pass. Depending on what the player chooses, it is possible to apply the command to a particular player, the player in possession of the ball, a part of the team (defense, midfield, attack) or the whole team. Everything is done relatively simply with combinations of buttons.</p>\n<p>There are no headers, bicycle kicks or other fancy movements, scoring goals is only possible by kicking the ball. A replay is played every time a foul is committed (which happen quite often), a shot off target is made, or a goal is scored.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Super Formation Soccer 95: della Serie A</em> is the fourth title of the Super Formation Soccer series released on the Super Famicom. As the title suggests, the game is based on the 1994-95 Italian Seria A season.</p>\n<p>Like the other Super Famicom installments in the series, the field is shown in a top-down perspective using Mode 7 scrolling. The fields themselves are facsimiles of actual Italian stadiums, with different grass types and home colors. At the beginning of a match in Serie A mode, a picture of the real-life stadium the field is based on is shown. The player can choose from 18 clubs, each with 22 players. However, each team can only have three foreign players (the initial release of this game preceded the \"Bosman ruling\" of 1995). Before a match begins, the player can choose different formations and whether the goalkeeper will be controlled automatically, semi-automatically or manually. </p>\n<p>There are six modes available: Exhibition, Serie A, Situation, Practice, Edit Team, and Option. Adding to the realism, the player can choose to play matches in Italian (menus will continue to be in either English or Japanese). Certain real-life data on the players can also be viewed.</p>",

Further teams are available as unlocks - winning the Super Bowl with a regular team gives a code for a classic team of the same franchise, and some special hidden teams also exist.</p>\n<p>Playing modes are exhibition, a full season and playoffs including the Super Bowl. In seasons and playoffs, any game can be either played or simulated (with the exception of the Super Bowl, which must be played). Quarter length can be set from 3 to 15 minutes. All 30 team's stadiums are available for selection, with changeable weather conditions for the open fields, including fair weather, wind, rain, snow and even night games. Further options are two skill levels (Pro and All Madden), freely definable audibles, eight different penalties that can be set to different levels, player fatigue, injuries and substitutions. Play calling mode can be set to a bluff mode, offense and pass catching can be set to manual or automatic, and there is an instant replay feature. Player records and season/playoff progress are saved via battery.</p>\n<p>The game also features player creation and trading. Player creation features tryout mini-games. 13 events in all must be accomplished to determine a player's stats, including running, an obstacle course, following coaching directions, passing, tackling, etc. All events can be practiced individually.</p>\n<p>Multiplayer is available via multitap for up to five players, who can play against each other or on the same team. The player using the first controller always calls plays and controls the quarterback, while the remaining players control other players on the field.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>ABC Monday Night Football</em> is a football game licensed from the television presentation of the same name. It features the likeness of broadcaster Frank Gifford and the logo of a popular sports drink, but has no league license, so features generic team names with made-up logos and player names.</p>\n<p>The two main playing modes are pre-season exhibition games and a full season. 28 teams are available, and it is possible to rename teams and players and even create custom teams. A two-player mode for versus games is also available.</p>\n<p>During games, a standard behind-the-quarterback view of the field is used. The playbook consists of 10 plays. Controls differ from the norm established by other games in that button-tapping increases the power of kicks and running speed during rushing and defense. The game automatically saves impressive plays as replays that can later be watched from the menu.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dharma D\u014dj\u014d</em> is a puzzle game, and conversion of an <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/67416/dharma-dojo/\">arcade game of the same name</a>. Unlike the arcade original where the player has to move the character around the screen in order to hit a block with the mallet, this version automatically aligns the player with the furthest most block. This port also features four game modes (two more than the arcade version).</p>\n<p>In the story mode (\u3060\u308b\u307e\u9053\u4e2d\u8a18), evil spirits have attacked and you must defeat them with the help of good spirits. Playing as either the monk or maiden, you must use a hammer to knock items to the left. These then appear in an area at the bottom of the screen. If all the items do not match, when the bottom area is full, the entire row moves back onto the screen, pushing the stacks up one level. If the items all match, they will turn into a good spirit and attack the evil spirit, slowing it. Do not delay, because the evil spirit is always climbing a rope to try to get to and cut a rope holding the temple bell. If the evil spirit cuts the temple bell rope or the stacks extend above the top level of the playing field, the game is over.</p>\n<p>In the second game mode, referred to as Dhama Training Editing (\u305f\u308b\u307e\u4fee\u884c\u7de8), you begin with a stack of sixteen items, stacked four across and four high. You must create groups of the same four items at the bottom. While there is no evil spirit climbing on the left, you still cannot tarry. After a certain length of time, another block of sixteen items will drop onto the field. A bird-man will give you a countdown warning when this is about to occur and you can see what is coming next on the right. If the stacks extend to past the top of the playing field, the game is over.</p>\n<p>In the third game mode, called Dharma Questions and Answers (\u305f\u308b\u307e\u554f\u7b54), you are shown a pattern of items on the right. You must duplicate this pattern on the left, within a certain number of moves or within a time limit. If you succeed, you move to a more difficult pattern. If you fail, the game is over.</p>\n<p>The last game mode is a two-player competitive game (\u3075\u305f\u308a\u3067\u5bfe\u6c7a). You must create groups of four of the same item at the bottom. If the group you create is four creatures, like cats or pigs, then a row of those will be added to the top of your competitor's stack. If you create a row of the same colored blocks, you will light one of your competitor's lamps. If you light all four of your competitor's lamps or your competitor's stack extends past the top of the playing field, you win a round. Win two out of three rounds to win the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Somewhere deep in the city of Osaka, there's a notorious sports club known for producing some of Osaka's most notorious (yet toughest) street thugs. Its name is the Karate Club, based on the grounds of Kangokou High School. But now the club's in danger of losing that reputation. A bunch of would-be tough guys have come to Osaka, and are out to prove themselves against the club. It's up to Yoshiyuki Takagi, the leader of the club and of the Osaka thug scene, to turn them back and prove, once and for all, that his club is truly the toughest of the tough.</p>\n<p>Based on the Japanese manga series, <em>Osu!! Karate Bu</em> is a fighting game similar to those being produced at the time in which a single player controlling Yoshiyuki Takagi battles through a series of tough men in order to prove his club's toughness. Each of the game's 12 characters has a life meter that must be reduced to 0, as well as a chi meter which not only allows players to execute special moves (depending on how much chi is left), but also helps players get back up after getting knocked out. (The quicker you get up, the more health you gain back.) But this can only be done twice per match, and if it happens three times you'll be down for the count.</p>\n<p>In addition to the story mode, players can also choose to play an arcade mode in which any character can prove he's the toughest, as well as a 2-player VS mode and a team battle in which players choose teams of up to five combatants to battle against each other.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This special edition of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5199/donkey-kong-country/\">Donkey Kong Country</a> is a competition cartridge. Nintendo manufactured only 2,500 copies. The game was originally used for Nintendo PowerFest '94, where it was the final competition between the two finalists to decide who would be crowned the 1994 Nintendo World Champion. It was later used during another competition, the Blockbuster World Video Game Championship II, where it got its name. Afterwards, the cartridges were sold exclusively to subscribers of Nintendo Power.</p>\n<p>The game itself is largely identical to the retail cartridge, but several limitations were added to make it suitable for competitions. Most notably, a timer has been added, only allowing for five minutes of gameplay, after which the game simply freezes. Only a few select levels are playable (a total of 11, of which only 8 randomly chosen levels are available per playthrough), most of which which are not presented in normal order, and many being skipped altogether. The game starts immediately at the first level, Jungle Hijinxs, and upon exiting the level, goes immediately to the next, without showing the map. Animal Tokens in the early levels are replaced with banana bunches. In Jungle Hijinxs, Donkey Kong's Tree House and the Banana Hoard cave are inaccessible. There was also an addition: at the start of the game, instead of 5 Extra Lives, players are given 50.</p>",

There was also some narration, as well as added cutscenes. Some minor changes were also made to gameplay. These include a simplified Toad House, and Fire Flower and Treasure Ship icons on the overworld maps. The Fire Flower icon allows Mario to become Fire Mario after exiting a level, and the Treasure Ship icon appears after clearing all levels in a World, allowing easier and more frequent access to them. Finally, a timer is added that counts down to the end of the World cycle.</p>",

The most major addition to gameplay is the new goal of collecting Golden Mario Statues throughout the levels (a concept later revived in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4305/super-mario-advance/\">Super Mario Advance</a>, but with Yoshi Eggs). The player must then defeat the level boss. Another addition is that in each level, after defeating its boss, the player must locate and defeat Wart, who is found in every level by traveling down a vase while in Subspace. If there is still time left on the timer after all goals in an episode are completed, the player may explore any levels as much as they want before time runs out. Other additions include a points system, cutscenes, and forced character changes as the game progresses, starting with Mario.</p>",

        "description": "<p>As the title suggests, this game is a crossover between the <em>Mario</em> and <em>Excitebike</em> series. The game was exclusively released as a broadcast on the Satellaview add-on for the Super Famicom. The game was split into four episodes. Depending on which episode is being played, the roster of playable characters changes. In the first episode, Mario, Luigi, and Toad are available. In the second episode, Wario is added, and in the third, Princess Peach. In the fourth episode, Yoshi is made available, but Luigi is subtracted from the roster.</p>\n<p>Like the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7469/excitebike/\">Excitebike</a>, players must safely maneuver through a dangerous course on motorbikes. Obstacles appear that can slow the player down or send them flying. In the event they do become airborne, players must adjust the angle of their bike as they fall to prevent crashing. Players can also race by themselves against computer-controlled Green and Red Koopa Troopas, or against each other in a 2-player 1-on-1 race.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Kid\u014d But\u014dden G Gundam</em> is based on the 1994 anime TV series of the same name. The first Gundam production not set in the continuity established in the 1979 original series of the franchise, <em>G Gundam</em> presents a world in which global conflicts are settled in a yearly tournament fought between Gundam mecha, each representing its nation's qualities (and stereotypes). Naturally, this premise was adapted into a one-on-one fighting game.</p>\n<p>The game includes 10 different Gundams (one of which can only be selected by players via a secret code), each with its own arena and background music. Four different playing modes are on offer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Story Battle allows a limited selection of only five Gundams (the members of the Shuffle Alliance in the series), presenting a series of nine matches against all other Gundams in the game. All matches consist of only one round.</li>\n<li>Versus Battle is for two-player matches. Players choose their Gundam, its pilot (different pilots have different attributes regarding performance, defence and speed) and arena. Both players can select the same Gundam (with the exception of the secret character) and pilot. Matches are best-of-three. Handicaps can be set for each player.</li>\n<li>Championship Battle is similar to Story Battle, but is in best-of-three mode, allows Gundam selection from the full roster and lacks story sequences.</li>\n<li>Team Battle is a team-based two-player mode. Players select between one to five Gundams per team. One-round matches follow, with the loser being removed from the roster until only one team remains.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Controls involve the four face buttons for weak and strong punches and kicks, and the two shoulder buttons for quick forward or backward dashes. Each Gundam has its own special moves triggered via input combinations, including extra powerful \"desperation attacks\", which can only be activated if the Gundam's life bar has been significantly lowered and flashes red.</p>",

Most of the playing modes are the same as on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/72975/madden-nfl-98/\">Genesis</a>, but the SNES version has its own selection of teams and gameplay options.</p>\n<p>Players can select from the 30 teams of the 1997 NFL season, the 1997 All-Madden team, an EA Sports and a THQ team, a Players, Inc. (NFLPA) team, plus 28 classic NFL teams - one per franchise minus the 1995 expansion teams and the 86 Browns for the Ravens. Playing modes include exhibition games (now optionally as a best-of-three or best-of-five series), seasons and playoffs. There is also an option to replay all Super Bowls since 1988. The game tracks records in 7 categories, pre-filled at the start with records to beat. A new feature are hot and cold streaks for teams, in which their recent playing history influences their current stats. Player creation and trading returns from the predecessors. As in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/66340/madden-nfl-97/\">Madden 97</a> (but unlike in the Genesis version), players are created by performing a number of tryout mini-games, all of which can be practiced individually and for which records are tracked. During a season, there is detailed stats tracking, for the overall league, conference, or individual team. There are options for salary caps and trading deadlines in seasons and playoffs. Exclusive SNES features include stadium selection and optional windy weather.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The third <em>Super Robot Taisen</em> game is the first to appear on the Super Famicom and a direct sequel to its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/33761/dai-2-ji-super-robot-taisen/\">predecessor</a>. Six months after the war against the Divine Crusaders, the heroes that defeated them (now organized in the Londo Bell special forces unit) are called back into action. The DC remnants have regained strength under the control of the Zabi family. Additionally, unexplained disappearances near lunar colonies indicate that there might be another faction in play. It is up to Londo Bell to investigate and fight the next Super Robot War.</p>\n<p>Like its predecessor, the game is a turn-based strategy game with heavy RPG elements that crosses over characters and robots from various animated TV series and puts them into an all-new story. The game features 58 missions (more than doubling the number from SRW2) and introduces a branching mission path to the series. The path through the game is determined via direct player choices during and after missions as well as mission performance (i.e. number of turns required to complete the level). The choices made also lead to three different possible endings.</p>\n<p>The basic gameplay of the series remains unchanged from the predecessor, with players having their units move and attack on a map of the area via context-sensitive menus and fights played out as animated scenes. Series mainstays like the spirit (for unleashing special powers) and negotiate (for making enemy units defect) commands also make a return.</p>\n<p>The strategic complexity however has been increased. Pilots and their robots are now separate entities with separate stats, making it possible for pilots to switch robots between missions, but only within their own franchise (i.e. Amuro Ray can control all Gundam, but no Mazinger robots). Another new feature is the ability to set one of four global counterattack strategies: from aggressive (always counterattack) to conservative (only if the counterattack can't destroy the unit or if it has more than 50% HP) to defensive (never counterattack).</p>\n<p>The pilots are rated in six stats: attack power, probability to hit, piloting skill (determining damage potential and chance of critical attacks), response (determining chance of evading attacks), willpower (required for special attacks) and intuition (a static overall bonus). Stats are automatically raised through leveling, done by gaining experience points in combat. The robots are rated in hit points, energy, range, armor and maximum response (limiting the respective pilot's stat). All stats but range can be upgraded between levels by spending money, which, like XP, is gained through defeating enemies. Additionally, both pilot and robot are also rated in their adaptability to different terrain types. Each robot comes with a variety of unique weapons, which also all have their own stats: attack power, range, probability to hit, and ammo or energy requirements. Ammo, like spirit points, only refills at the end of a mission, but energy regenerates continually.</p>\n<p>Besides adding some new robots and characters from the known franchises (including Gundam's <em>War in the Pocket</em> and <em>Stardust Memory</em>), the game introduces franchises from outside the Gundam/Mazinger/Getter Robo trinity for the first time: making their debut in the series are <em>Raideen</em>, <em>Combattler V</em> and <em>Daitarn 3</em>.</p>",

Stacking three or more items of the same type makes them disappear, thus increasing the green bar on the bottom. As soon as that bar is full, the stage is cleared.</p>\n<p>There is also a two-player mode that uses the same gameplay as the single-player mode (where the second player controls Sterling), both cooperative and versus, as well as a two-player \"course game\", where each player must run along a course by avoiding and pushing obstacles out of the way.</p>",

The gameplay mechanics remain the same: the player character is controlled like spinner and moves from point to point across a field filled with obstacles. The main goal is to try to find the only one way out of the grid without hitting any obstacles, enemy spinners or other hazards on the field of play. However, the puzzles and graphics were redesigned and there are cutscenes with a new player character.</p>",

Each character has their own strengths and weaknesses. Dany for example can shoot bullets from the chest, while Mathilda excels in speed and Marius is able to crawl. Gameplay includes platforming, defeating or evading enemies as well as retrieving keys for doors. If the player switches between characters the last character will turn to stone and can\u2019t be harmed by enemies.</p>",

Of course Alfred has to stop them now.</p>\n<p>The gameplay follows the genre standards: Alfred walks through the 21 levels and needs to avoid enemies/obstacles by jumping over them. Every contact with enemies is deadly except when using Alfred's dive bomb attack. Occasionally there are simple switch puzzles to solve, mostly in order to find secret rooms with goodies. Examples for power-ups are hidden watering cans (collecting all unlocks a different ending), additional time, temporary invincibility or diamonds (100 reward an extra life). Balloons on the way act as restarting points after death. In some instances, the level ends with a boss fight.</p>",

All three games are available for the first time for the Super Famicom in this compilation release. As in the original games, the player can create characters choosing from five races and eight classes, and level them up by exploring the maze and fighting monsters, finding and buying items in process.</p>\n<p>Monster graphics have been updated, and dungeons have been given textures, but the player can also opt for original graphics with wireframe dungeons. An auto-mapping feature has been added. The player can also transfer characters between the three scenarios. </p>\n<p>Though released only in Japan for the Super Famicom, the game can be played almost entirely in English by changing the corresponding settings in the option menu.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Captain Tsubasa V: Hasha no Shougou Campione</em> is another installment in the ever-popular series based on the Japanese anime \"Captain Tsubasa\". This particular installment is set during the \"World Youth\" arc and focuses mainly on Tsubasa Oozora's year in the Italian Serie A league and his time representing Japan in international competition. However, other characters in the series have their own minor stories as well. The main objective is to make it to the World Cup and conquer all opposition... including the ever-imposing and seemingly unbeatable Campione team!</p>\n<p>Unlike previous installments in the series, the gameplay takes place with the pitch in full view. However, other elements of the series are still intact: The player can still advance to the goal if there's no opponent in the way, and can stop the action at the appropriate time to make an action. If the player has the ball, he/she can pass, shoot, dribble, or etc. And when on defense, the player can either tackle, cut pass/shoot, or mark an opponent with the ball.</p>\n<p>Players can also compete in the All-Star mode, where they can set up custom matches against a second player or the CPU, pick a team (from Club football or National League teams), and set other custom options.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mystery Circle</em> is a puzzle game set in the distant future, with <em>Tetris</em> and <em>Qix</em> overtones throughout. To complete a level, the player must draw around the outline of the falling shapes to erase them, while at the same time trying to stop them from filling the screen. As the player does this, the player's spaceship will constantly experience sudden changes in gravity as the ship goes upside down... and back again! The player can always use a space shuttle to instantly vaporize any block particles in the general vicinity of the ship, but this can only be performed once per game. The game is over when the screen is completely filled with blocks... or if the player completes all 71 levels.</p>\n<p>Two players can also compete against each other for the highest score.</p>",

        "description": "<p>They say that news travels fast... and at a typical Japanese school in the 1970's, it travels even faster! One particular day, for instance, it was announced that a representative of the school can go as an exchange student to a tropical paradise in the South Seas. But one of the students, a total slacker known as Maruko-chan, thinks it's just an excuse to soak up some rays. Furthermore, two of her schoolmates, Tama-chan and Hanawa, also have an interest in filling that one spot. Not one to let even good friends come between her and a relaxing beach vacation, Maruko-chan has proposed a representative battle pitting the three against one another in games of \"friendly\" competition. Will Maruko's plan succeed, or is she, like the ocean, all wet?</p>\n<p>Based on the Japanese manga and anime \"Chibi Maruko-chan\", <em>Chibi Maruko-chan: Mezase! Minami no Island!!</em> pits Maruko-chan and three of her friends against each other in a series of minigames where the main objective is to flatten the opposition and be the last one standing. On occasion, other characters may pop up to make things more interesting, and power-ups may also appear to give the character an advantage. There are three types of minigames that can be played:</p>\n<p><strong>Dodgeball</strong> - Players must attack the opposition with a dodgeball, while at the same time trying to avoid getting hit by either their opponent's dodgeball... or their own!</p>\n<p><strong>Painting</strong> - Using paint rollers, players must make their opponents slip up... while at the same time watching how much paint really is left.</p>\n<p><strong>Sumo</strong> - Players must bump their opponents into the water.</p>\n<p>In all of the games, when a character has lost all three lives, that character is eliminated from play, and the last character standing wins the round. Two victories out of three wins the stage.</p>\n<p>In addition, the player can also participate in a series of bonuses: a trivia game, a painting program in which up to four players can work together on the same drawing, a fortune-teller program, and a karaoke program.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Sword World SFC</em> is a game based on the tabletop role-playing game <em>Sword World</em> by Group SNE, released for the Japanese SNES, Super Famicom, hence the SFC on the title. Comparing to other J-RPG's, the game is more like western RPG's, where you have to create your character, choose his race, classes and stats, rather than having a set hero for the story. The game is supposed to follow roughly the same rules as the tabletop books.</p>\n<p>The story is set in the world of Forceria, which is in the same universe as the anime/manga Record of Lodoss War, and has many similarities to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, having races such as humans, elves, dwarfs, Grass Runners (Halfling like creatures), and half-elves. Classes available include: fighter, thief, ranger, sage, bard, sorcerer, shaman and priest. You start the game with 2500 experience points, which you can use to \"buy\" classes for you character. Combat is turn based, and experience points come in very slowly.</p>\n<p>In 1994 a sequel was released, called <em>Sword World SFC 2 Inishie no Kyojin Densetsu</em> (Legend of the Ancient Giant).</p>",

With the transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty to China, the protectionist Hong Kong government fears an invasion and dispatches Bruce Lee's brother Chin to slaughter anyone he comes across. Somehow, a reincarnated Tong Shau Ping is leading the Chinese forces and acts as Chin's greatest enemy.</p>\n<p>This chaotic shooter has Chin firing bullets into endless numbers of enemies while dodging their bullets. After surviving the onslaught for long enough, Tong Shau Ping appears as the game's only boss. Defeating him leads the game to start over again, continuing until the player dies. All of the characters are depicted via crude digitzed sprites, while the backgrounds are assorted vaguely thematic images. Throughout the game, a five-second loop of the children's song I Love Beijing Tiananmen loops continuously.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Arabian Nights: Sabaku no Seirei-\u014d</em> is a Japanese role-playing game released for the Super Famicom. The game starts with the Djinn Ifrit being defeated by a sorcerer named Suleiman. Suleiman then makes Ifrit his servant. One day Suleiman is defeated by a mysterious sorcerer, robbing Ifrit from the opportunity to take revenge on the man that enslaved him for so long. With his last strength Suleiman seals Ifrit in a magical ring and so gives him the opportunity to take revenge on the person that robbed him of his revenge. The game follows a girl named Shukran who finds the ring containing Ifrit helps him to regain his power and seek revenge on the mysterious sorcerer who defeated his master and ultimately grant his freedom.</p>\n<p>Arabian Nights employs a turn-based battle system that is traditional with a unique hook. Elemental barrier cards alter the entire playing field and affect both players and enemies alike. Cards come in one of nine attributes and five levels, with higher levels producing greater effects. Both players and enemies can lay down barrier cards to swing the battle in their favor.</p>\n<p>The game is nonlinear to a great extent. The main objective is to collect all of the elemental crystals and restoring Ifrit to full power. The order these are done is left to the player. Compared to most role-playing games Arabian Nights is short at 10-15 hours but does have multiple endings depending on your actions.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Super Tekky\u016b Fight!</em> is a maze action game by Banpresto and a spinoff in the Compati Hero Series. Players control one of the four Compati Heroes (Kamen Rider Black RX, Gundam RX-78, Fighter Roa, and Ultraman) as they defeat enemies within a time limit to move on. Though similar in style and appearance to Bomber Tekkyuu Fight differs in that its heroes use melee weapons, specifically a ball and chain. There are numerous power-ups that not only increase its power but also its length and size. Enemies can be stunned by jumping on their heads and you can flip tiles to achieve the same effect. The ability to jump is heavily relied on in later stages to navigate each map and reach enemies before is up. These features helped Super Tekkyuu Fight! differentiate itself from Hudson's series.</p>\n<p>The game features an extensive single player story mode that is nonlinear, complete with bosses at the end of each world. Characters are drawn from all four heroes' respective series (with the exception of original character Fighter Roa) to add variety and depth. There is also a multiplayer mode with 8 zones that feature their own unique hazards.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Tokimeki Memorial: Densetsu no Ki no Shita de</em> (\"Beneath the Tree of Legend\") is a port of the highly popular Konami dating simulation game, compressed into a 32-megabit Super Famicom cartridge and based on the original 1994 PC-Engine CD version (as opposed to the enhanced PS1 port \"Forever With You\", which contained additional content). To date, it is the only Tokimemo game to be released on a Nintendo home console.</p>\n<p>Due to the technical limitations of the cartridge format, voice acting is almost entirely eliminated; however, after completing the game once, starting the game again will cause a voice clip of the girl with the highest affection from the previous playthrough to play during loading. Despite the scaled-down nature of this port, the gameplay is more or less unchanged.</p>\n<p>Original copies come bundled with a mini-CD containing a specially recorded drama track, \"Taste is Appletarte\", and a re-arranged version of the game's closing theme, \"Futari no Toki\", sung by the majority of the heroines.</p>",

The screen also scrolls endlessly in all directions as the ship always remain in the middle of the screen. The ship has an unlimited amount of bullets and can shoot in all directions. There are both asteroids and enemies to defeat. A radar in the top left corner of the screen shows what is incoming. The ship has a life meter and can take a few hits.</p>\n<p>Unlike the original game there is an open world progression where different sectors can be tackled in any order by selecting them on a world map.

The game contains six levels with the standard gameplay of digging to collect crystals and avoiding falling boulders. The player's character is a futuristic, mechanical creature/robot. The difficulty level gradually increases and levels have a time limit. Five lives are available. The game uses the console's Mode 7 feature to zoom in when a crystal is collected. The same function is also used to rotate the level when it is completed and sometimes it is used during the game as well, causing the rocks to fall in the opposite direction.</p>",

The Hurricanes must arrive at the foreign stadium on time or the Gorgons will automatically win the match.</p>\n<p>The game consists of 15 levels that each must be completed within a certain time limit. Players control either Cal Casey  or Napper Thompson. They go throughout each stage dribbling a soccer ball.\nThe ball can be used as a makeshift weapon as it can be kicked at enemies and also can be used to open boxes scattered throughout each level.\nThe crates contain items like medals and trophies that can be collected. Those collected items get totaled at the end of each stage and get added as bonus points to the players score.</p>\n<p>The game features an easy, medium, and hard difficulty level option.</p>",

The levels themselves are based on movie set themes. Movies include Honey, I Shrunk the Pink, Pinkin Hood, Cat on a Hot Pink Roof, Pink Beard, Jungle Pink, The Pink Ranger, Pinkenstein, and The Polter Pink. There are also hidden safe rooms which can be found.</p>\n<p>Players can find tokens throughout the levels which are in turn used to gain access to other levels or can be spent to use movie set items like bridges, stairs, and hooks or even an umbrella and a magic carpet which both can be used for temporary flight.</p>\n<p>Besides hopping on enemies or spraying them with a Squirt sprayer, The Pink Panther can deal with enemies by using items from his bag of tricks like a fly swatter, a stoplight, a jackhammer, sledgehammer, a bowling ball, a detonator, or a white dog.</p>\n<p>Options let the player choose how many lives they start with (3,4, or 5) and at what score intervals (25,000, 50,000, or 100,000) will the player earn an extra one.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The world of La Gias, situated inside our Earth. For millennia, the Holy Kingdom of Langran ruled over the lands of La Gias with its long, proud history and an unprecedented level of technology. However, the days of the kingdom are numbered. Seers and scholars predict that the mighty state will fall in the next 10 years, thus bringing forth the destruction of their world. In an effort to stave off such a terrible prediction, Langran produces powerful machines, called the Masou Kishin, powered by pilot's sheer willpower, called \"pr\u0101na\". The majority of the people of Langran however, do not possess enough willpower to control these giant mechanical beings. In their last ditch effort, the kingdom summons a few people from the Surface (Earth). Among them is Masaki And\u014d, a man that will rise to the challenge of putting an end to an almost invincible evil.</p>\n<p><em>Masou Kishin The Lord of Elemental</em> is the first <em>Super Robot Wars/Taisen</em> game that does not feature any licensed franchises; instead, it tells the story of the original characters that were previously introduced in <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/33761/dai-2-ji-super-robot-taisen/\">SRW 2</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/73866/dai-3-ji-super-robot-taisen/\">3</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/73917/super-robot-taisen-ex/\">EX</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/141669/dai-4-ji-super-robot-taisen/\">4</a></em>. Like its contemporaries, it is a turn-based tactical RPG game. The player goes through a comprehensive campaign, battling against enemies and leveling up their units. After battles, players can upgrade their units' stats. Alongside the battles, players experience the story through the eyes of the main protagonist and make important choices that can have an impact on how the story plays out.</p>\n<p>While the core gameplay remains relatively the same as that of the previous classic <em>Super Robot Wars/Taisen</em> titles, <em>Masou Kishin</em> introduced a number of features that would be implemented in later games of the franchise. For one, the graphics are vastly enhanced: robots are represented in actual proportions during battle, instead of the \"super-deformed\" look of the previous titles. The battlefield is now in isometric position, compared to the top-down view of the previous titles. The isometric view also allows for more tactical depth: units attacking from behind deal greater damage than attacking from the front. Terrain also affects unit stats that can give a notable advantage over the enemy.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Fork Parker's Crunch Out</em> is a homebrew game starring <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/513980/fork-parker/\">Fork Parker</a>, the fictional CFO of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Devolver+Digital\">Devolver Digital</a>. It was created to raise awareness about \"crunch time\" in game development, a practice in some companies when employees are expected to put in a large amount of (unpaid) overtime hours to get the game done in a proposed time. Devolver Digital donated 100% of their profits from sales to Take This, an organization that raises awareness and aims to combat mental health issues.</p>\n<p>At the start of the game Fork Parker feels threatened by the rise of a new publisher, Cash Cow Games. They released <em>Loot Box: The Game</em> where only one in twenty downloads contains the actual game and they bought their own e-sports team. Parker decides it is time to catch up with them through crunch time. The player controls Parker in the office with mechanics typical of time management titles. He needs to bring employees caffeine to keep them awake, serve hamburgers at their desks, whip them into working, literally, using a bat, or resuscitate them using a dose of electricity when they pass out. The game takes place on a single, fixed screen and most actions are tied to moving to one of the four stations near the top of the screen, for instance to get coffee. An icon of an employee's head shows the current mood / status and Parker needs to move quickly to the correct station to remedy it. There is also a pink pet pig Pork running around and it needs to be avoided. When Parker comes in contact with it, he shakes it for a long time and B needs to be tapped repeatedly to make him let go.</p>\n<p>Levels last only five minutes and then the developers' game needs to be done, with progress shown through a bar near the top of the screen. The first level starts with four developers, but the number of people increases with every new stage. Between levels, upgrades can be bought using money. Upgrades affect the stations, but also Parker himself. For instance increasing his movement speed, reducing the time he pets Pork, healing all negative status effects or earning 30 seconds of unpaid overtime. The latter are either single-use items or only last a single day, while the station upgrades are permanent.</p>\n<p>Coins constantly appear between the desks and Parker needs to collect these to purchase the upgrades. There are also a large number of additional mini-games to play. These are tied to the development, such as completing a mini-game to fix the internet that has gone out so all development is halted. In another mini-game an employee has ordered food delivery through a drone, but lunch breaks are not permitted so Parker needs to intercept and catch the food in a sequence with a side view, throwing items back until the drone crashes.</p>\n<p>The game was released on a cartridge, with a box and a full colour manual. The initial run was 1,000 copies.</p>",

It is actually an arcade shooter with puzzle elements. There are 10 levels divided into 10 stages each in the main single-player mode. In order to progress the player has to detonate all the bombs on the screen with a single well-placed shot. This mode can be also played as a turn-based duel for 2 human players.</p>\n<p>There is also a 4-player battle mode available. It is a head-to-head single-player or multi-player mode where 4 characters stand on each side of the screen and shoot marbles in the opponents to gain the points.</p>\n<p>The player is able to customize the characters' appearance and edit the stages.</p>\n<p>An exclusive <em>B-Daman</em> toy known as <em>Yellow Aurora B-Daman (\u30a4\u30a8\u30ed\u30fc\u30aa\u30fc\u30ed\u30e9\u30d3\u30fc\u30c0\u30de\u30f3)</em> was included in the game box. It has a marble with <em>JBA (All Japan B-Daman Association)</em> logotype on it.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Energy Breaker</em> is set on a small, fictitious island called Zamuria. The story begins with Myra, a 21-year-old girl who has lost her memory. She keeps having dreams warning that she must hurry to avert a catastrophe. After visiting the fortune-teller Selphia who has just come to the Myra's town, she finds herself drawn into a conflict between four mysterious Dark Generals who are seeking the power of four jewels. With the local inventor Renard and his robot assistant Gulliver, they embark on a time-travelling adventure to meet new allies, uncover her forgotten past, and learn of the Dark Generals' plot that may threaten the world.</p>\n<p><em>Energy Breaker</em> is hinted to take place in the same world as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Taito\">Taito's</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Lufia\">Lufia</a> series: for instance, the presence of Priphea flowers, some terminology and conventions, an obtainable sword named after the Dual Blade, and a cameo appearances by Lufia and Roman in the ending.</p>\n<p><em>Energy Breaker</em> combines gameplay elements from traditional Japanese role-playing games and strategy/tactical role-playing games. The player is able to explore dungeons and towns from the same isometric perspective of the game's battle system. The game features many hidden items that can be found by interacting with the background environment, as well as a staggering amount of descriptive text for the environments that change throughout the course of the game, often several times. The player is able to choose an emotion or attitude when talking to NPCs, however this rarely seems to make a difference. Dungeon exploration transitions seamlessly into episode-like grid-based battle scenarios with preset enemy layouts and conditions as opposed to random encounters. Battles are typically won by defeating all enemies, though other win conditions exists such as defeating a boss, surviving a certain number of turns, or arriving to a specific point of the battle grid.</p>\n<p>The battle mechanics are based around a \"Balance\" component. Player characters and enemies all receive an amount of Balance at the start of their turn, however the less HP a unit has, the less they will receive at the start of that turn. Balance is required to perform most actions, such as moving, performing basic and special attacks, and using items. Special attacks and skills are learned by finding and using \"Grimoire\" items before battle, and are equipped according to an energy system that consists of four types: blue, red, yellow, and green. One energy type may be leveled up once per level up, up to a maximum of eight. Before they can be used, special skills require the character to meet a specific minimum level of each of the four energy types, which themselves can be continually adjusted throughout the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>SD The Great Battle: Aratanaru Ch\u014dsen</em> is an action game that crosses over the <em>Ultraman</em>, <em>Kamen Rider</em> and <em>Gundam</em> franchises in Super Deformed style. The story begins when the environmental control system of the SD Nation malfunctions, which revives hordes of evil creatures. Kamen Rider V3, Ultraman Taro and Knight Gundam go on a mission to investigate, but soon disappear. Now the original Kamen Rider, Ultraman and Gundam must find their friends so they can defeat the evil behind it all together.</p>\n<p>The game consists of seven levels, seen from a bird's eye perspective, which range from flying islands and mysterious castles to spaceships. The player can switch between the different heroes at any time. Once the missing heroes are found, they can also be used. The levels are full of regular and boss enemies from various incarnations of the three franchises. To defeat them, the heroes can use a standard gun as well as a powerful special weapon unique to each character that requires energy to operate. A helpful ally can be found in each level who will boost the special energy.</p>",

This version offers a couple of new features over <em>Endorfun</em>: there is an Easy Mode, which reduces the available colours from six down to three; and there is also a Puzzle Mode which gives the player predefined boards to solve, and a limited number of moves to do so.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Socks the Cat</em> is a new frontier in licensed games: presidential pets. Players take on the role of then-President of the United States Bill Clinton's pet cat Socks on a journey of great political importance. Robbers break into the White House and succeed in stealing a portable nuclear missile... and Socks. Players, as Socks, need to break themselves out while also recovering the nuclear missile to save the world.</p>\n<p>Players control Socks from a side-scrolling perspective in a typical 2D platformer. Just like most other games in the genre, players can run and jump their way to victory. Being a cat, Socks can also use his claws - this is his main means of protection, with most enemies able to be taken down by a few strategic claw swipes. Players can also pick up a few other items to help them out, such as blocks of cheese that can be thrown to distract mouse enemies. A few levels feature real-world political themes, like the final level set in the White House's famous rose garden, but most feature generic platforming themes like warehouses or sewers. The political theme also shows up in a few bosses which are caricatures of real-world political figures.</p>",

Players get to choose one of the three female characters to play as. The characters are slightly different from each other in their base statistics of speed and attack power. While each character can attack jump, double jump, block, crouch, and also grab enemies, they also have three unique moves each. Two special moves plus they also have a super move that when performed costs them some of their elemental powers. As the game progresses, the females can gain more health and attack power.</p>",

However, unlike <em>Sokoban</em>, pushing a block will make it go all the way until it bumps into another block or the borders of the level, thus, at times, players will need to plan their actions to make sure that all the blocks of one color are gone. The level is considered as complete once players have made all the boxes disappear.</p>\n<p>In case players have made a mistake, they can restart the level by pressing L+R on their controllers. However, restarting the level does not restart the timer. Once players run out of time, they lose a life.</p>\n<p>The game also includes a multiplayer option, where up to 4 players compete against each other according to the rules that players can set up beforehand. A stage builder is also available in the game. It allows players to create and play through their own stages.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The cute bounty hunter known as Popful Mail looks like she would have no trouble making a living slashing bad guys with her sword. In reality Mail is having a hard time making ends meet. One day, however, she learns about a magician who has gone rogue and has a hefty bounty on his head. Her adventure begins as Popful fights her way through a new adventure, and makes new friends along the way.</p>\n<p><em>Popful Mail</em> is a platform action game with very light RPG elements. As the heroine makes her way through the stages she collects money from slain foes. This money can be used in shops to buy weapons, armor, health, and so on. The game features interaction with many characters through both on-screen dialog and fully animated sequences. Some of these characters become playable as the player progresses through the game.</p>\n<p>This release has the same story and general gameplay style as the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/44162/popful-mail/\"> earlier version</a>, but otherwise was made from scratch, having entirely different graphics, locations, enemies, challenges, etc.</p>",

The ability to switch drivers and engines between teams or the ten-second stop-go penalty are some of the many additions. A few drivers and circuits that weren't part of the 1993 season are also included making it possible to compete in the 1991 and 1992 seasons.</p>",

Like its predecessor, the game crosses over Bandai's <em>Gundam</em>, <em>Ultraman</em> and <em>Kamen Rider</em> franchises in super deformed style, but switches genres to a side-scrolling <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5088/final-fight/\">Final Fight</a>-style beat'em up, for either one or two players in co-op mode.</p>\n<p>The players can choose from four characters: Ultraman Great, Gundam F91, Rider RX, and the Banpresto original Fighter Roar. Characters can be switched at any time during gameplay. To defeat the various enemies (taken from all three franchises), the heroes can use punches, kicks and various combos. A powerful shot can be charged up that will lower the hero's health when used. Collecting and then using the energy capsules dropped by fallen enemies launches a powerful attack that attacks all enemies on screen. In co-op mode, a special two-player combination technique can be used, that,  depending on the hero combination, is either an extra powerful attack or heals damage.</p>\n<p>The game consists of eight levels, including the space colony, a spaceship, a lunar base, an Egyptian pyramid and more. Each level ends with a boss fight. Some fights lead to alternate routes depending on the players' performance. A password is given after every two levels that allows continuing the game.</p>",

Now, completely resurrected and full of power again, the demon king wants revenge and organizes his Maka Maka Society to conquer Earth.</p>\n<p>Players take control of Corum, a young student who is the reincarnation of the alien prince who initially defeated the demon king who will be joined in his quest to defeat the demon king by a very diverse cast of characters. The game's story and characters all have an absurdist and humorous style to them while battles are random and turn based and well animated for the time, showing how the characters attack one another. All of the main characters are actually reincarnations of great heroes of the past, and, thus, the magic system consists of them transforming into their past selves to use special abilities.</p>",

        "description": "<p><i>Day of the Idea</i> is a surreal turn-based JRPG starring a boy who has psychic powers. The boy is being researched and experimented on by scientists with interest in these powers. He escapes from the laboratory after awakening his psychokinetic powers and killing most of the people in the lab. He then sets out to find out more about his powers and gets involved in a deeper plot. His quest takes him across a dystopian world, picking up an eclectic group of allies along the way.</p>\n<p>The equipment system in Idea no Hi is different from most RPGs with players equipping articles of clothing as the armor in the game, giving players many different types of clothing to equip such as headgear, necklaces, undershirts, shirts, pants, underwear, gloves, and shoes. Certain types of clothing can also boost elemental resistances. When equipped with a certain theme of clothing, the character sprites may change to reflect that. Characters can also be cross-dressed and, at one point in the game, the player actually needs to cross-dress the main character to sneak into a town inhabited by women only.</p>\n<p>Battles are turn based in a first person perspective similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9223/dragon-warrior/\">Dragon Quest</a>. In the bottom of the screen are a hand drawn portraits of the players party which change their facial expressions with each action taken. The enemy sprites in-battle are also large and detailed, having unique animations for each of their attacks. The enemy encounters are random when travelling on the world map while in dungeons, they are visible and dash towards the player once he is in their sight.</p>\n<p>Up to four characters participate in battles with a fifth slot reserved for pets. The pet can participate in battles, however, it can't be controlled by the player. Different pets can be recruited throughout the game, but, unlike the party, they can't level up, giving players a good reason to switch to a new pet once it is recruited.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Benkei Gaiden: Suna no Sh\u014d</em> is the sequel to the PC Engine RPG <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/49456/benkei-gaiden/\">Benkei Gaiden</a>. The game is a turn-based role-playing game with random encounters utilizing a first-person battle system similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9223/dragon-warrior/\">Dragon Quest</a>. The influence extends to the interaction menu, which features multiple verb commands.</p>\n<p>The year is 1274; eighty-two years have passed since the capital was established in Kamakura. The Mongolian army, establishing its rule over China, has attacked Japan and conquered the city of Hakata. However, the Mongolian army has also suffered a devastating blow from a sudden storm and was forced to retreat. Emperor Kublai Khan, sensing that the storm was caused by a powerful spell, gathered sorcerers from his country and China and appointed one of the sorcerers as a general, sending him to conquer Japan.</p>\n<p>Thus, the events of the game take place in 13th-century Japan, China, Mongolia, and Korea. The Mongols that infiltrate Japan use magic to create a large number of monsters, causing chaos and throwing Japan into a state of panic. The game starts with the protagonist setting out to exterminate the monsters infesting Japan with the help of a temple's chief priest.</p>\n<p>The entire story is divided into two parts: the Japanese part and the Chinese mainland part.</p>\n<p>The Japanese part deals with the protagonist searching for six crystals needed to break the barrier and wake up Benkei to defeat the cursed army.</p>\n<p>The Mainland China part makes players travel across a vast map to the mainland in order to defeat the remaining three generals and Kublai Khan. It goes in some odd directions, such as having players travel through water with dinosaurs, adding time travel to the plot, being in a world where gods live in multiple dimensions, and other plot twists that are mixed with historical facts of that time period.</p>",

The game can be played in five different modes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>World Championship - Playing as a single or tag team, the player\u2019s goal is to accumulate victory points to qualify for matches against tougher opponents, otherwise the game ends early. To exclude points, the player can opt for the Title Defense Mode.</li>\n<li>Exhibition - This can be played with as a  single or tag team. Certain rules like the time limit and number of rounds can be set to the player\u2019s preference.</li>\n<li>Elimination - Played in tag teams, which requires the player to beat all members, including the reserves of the opposing team. The team members can be preset or customized.</li>\n<li>Open League - Uses the point system of the World Championship, but there are fewer opponents to fight.</li>\n<li>Wrestling Tutorial - Teaches the player within five matches to get a grasp of the controls and techniques.</li>\n</ul>",

The menu options and inventory system are reduced for easier and quicker navigation. In addition to members joining the player\u2019s companion party as the story progresses, it is also possible to hire up to four combat-specialized mercenaries. The player can also acquire four other units called idols, which are frail, but good at spellcasting. Random battles are now completely turn-based and option-driven, in which the player will battle with the companion party by default, but can switch them for the mercenary or idol party, both of which act completely independent of player control.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dottie Flowers</em> is a fangame created by a single developer and based on the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5656/turrican/\">Turrican</a>. Like <em>Turrican</em>, the gameplay of <em>Dottie Flowers</em> primarly consists of progressing through stages while platforming and firing large amounts of laser-like bullets. In <em>Dottie Flowers</em>, the player's main weapon is a high-tech magic broomstick and a combo counter is present in the right-hand corner of the screen, tracking how many hits the player has inflicted on enemies without taking damage themselves.</p>\n<p><em>Dottie Flowers</em> was initially exclusive to physical Super Nintendo Entertainment System cartridges sent to 100 people who mailed in postcards to a physical address provided at the end of a digitally-released <em>Dottie Flowers</em> demo. However, in March 2024, an emulator download for the game was made available on the game's official webpage.</p>\n<p>The game takes place in Cologne, Germany, where <em>Dottie Flower</em>'s developer grew up and where some of the games created by the <em>Turrican</em> developers, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/558/rainbow-arts-software-gmbh/\">Rainbow Arts Software GmbH</a>, were made.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In times past, a hero's use of three sacred relics have kept the Scarlet Lotus Castle town safe from a monster invasion. The relics were stored away in three separate dungeons. As time passes, monsters start reappearing again causing unrest among the townsfolk. The king decides to send a party of adventurers into the dungeons to retrieve the relics so they can put a stop to the current monster invasion.</p>\n<p><em>Wizardry: Throb of the Demon's Heart</em> is a first person dungeon crawler. Players create characters for there six person party at the training hall. Character creation offers 11 different races and 14 different classes to choose from, there alignment (good, evil, or neutral) and whether they're male or female. Characters have stats for strength, intelligence, piety, vitality, agility, and luck. Players can also import their characters from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/175203/wizardry-the-third-episode-scripture-of-the-dark/\">Wizardry: The Third Episode - Scripture of the Dark</a>.</p>\n<p>The game sticks close to the earliest Wizardry games. The town is explored through a menu, with the town having a tavern, shop. temple, and inn. The game has 3 dungeons to explore plus the training grounds which is a location in which players can gain experience on enemies they have already defeated in the other dungeons.</p>\n<p>It is also worth noting that the game has a normal mode and a mania mode. In mania mode, the game will constantly auto-save thus possibly putting the player in a tough predicament if they go into a dungeon unprepared.</p>",

The plot involves Waldo and his Waldo Watchers getting together to celebrate Wenda's birthday along with Where's Waldo author Martin Handford. However, Waldo's nemesis Odlaw sneaks in and swipes Waldo's magic walking stick and then uses it to scatter 99 Waldo Watchers all over the land. Now its up to Waldo and a lone Waldo Watcher to find the other Waldo Watchers and also find a present for Wenda.</p>\n<p>The game is set up where the player will be shown a picture of something (a person or object) and then will take control of a Waldo Watcher and guides him through areas that will contain the object somewhere. The player will be given a limited number of chances to select the correct object that matches what is shown in the picture. The player will be able to walk around the lands of civilizations such as ones with prehistoric cavemen, ancient Egyptians, Vikings. and Medieval times.</p>\n<p>The game has some light puzzle solving as some of the Waldo Watchers are locked away and the player will need to figure out a way to rescue them by doing things like stepping on buttons to lower walls or by using teleporters in the correct order.</p>",
