        "description": "<p>The sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Momotarou+densetsu\"> Momotar\u014d Densetsu</a> continues its story, which is based on an old Japanese folk tale. Momotar\u014d is a boy who was found by an old couple inside a giant peach. When he grew up, he found three faithful companions - a dog, a monkey, and a pheasant, and with their help defeated the evil demons of the Demon Island. Three years have passed since. Momotar\u014d and his friends do not suspect that deep beneath the Demon Island there lies a palace, in which resides Emma, the King of Hell. Unable to accept the victory of the humans over the demons, Emma sends his three most terrifying demonic servants to challenge the humans once again. It looks that Momotar\u014d's adventure wasn't over, after all...</p>\n<p>Like the first game, this is an \"old school\" Japanese RPG with simple gameplay mechanics. Moving Momotar\u014d over the world map, you visit towns, talk to people, buy weapons, and fight random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective.</p>",

Later, the boy decided to rid the land of the evil demon tribe. Help Momotar\u014d reach the Demon Island and defeat the demons!</p>\n<p>Gameplay-wise and graphically, this is a typical Momotar\u014d RPG: navigating the little hero through the top-down world map, the player visits towns, descends into dungeons, equips Momotar\u014d with weapons and armor, buys items, and fights random enemies and monsters in turn-based combat viewed from first person perspective.</p>",

John McClain decides to visit his wife Holly, who happens to be one of the hostages, and gets involved in the situation. Unlike other versions of <em>Die Hard</em> that are in the MobyGames database, the TurboGrafx-16 version is played from a top-down perspective, and consists of ten stages which have you fighting bad guys from forests, all the way through the Nakatomi Building, and finally on the roof where the final confrontation takes place. Weapons can be picked up by knocking down enemies, and include machine guns, laser shots, and flamethrowers. If you look hard enough, you may even obtain a bullet-proof vest, which may protect you from shots, but can also reduce its life.</p>",

Some enemies will drop eggs which will explode. You can kick these eggs and use them to destroy the enemies themselves.

Your older brother has summoned unspeakable forces of evil to take control of the kingdom. Treachery rules! Your only hope is the legendary royal sword! But will its power be enough to overcome the Cliffs of Chaos? The Skull Dungeons? And the treacherous Crypts of Slime? Only your courage, your fighting skill, and the Legendary Axe can answer!</p>\n<p>This game has you fighting monsters through seven stages with just a sword, but three other weapons can be picked up along the way, and include axes, chain spears, and smart bombs. These weapons can only be obtained by collecting the power-up that a defeated enemy leaves behind. Weapons can be switched along the way. At the end of each level, you must defeat a huge boss in order to go to the next stage.</p>",

Although it is a side-scrolling platformer, the gameplay and level structure are very different. This game has 4 side-scrolling areas, 1 of which is the final boss level. The other 3 levels can be tackled in any order, and in them you must collect several puzzle pieces. After collecting all the puzzle pieces and finishing the level, you can put the pieces together and solve the puzzle to unlock the last level. Each level features a boss character taken directly from the animated series.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Final Lap Twin</em> is an open-wheel F1-style racing game loosely based on Namco's Final Lap arcade game. The game display is always in split screen mode, even if only one player is playing. The other display shows your nearest rival if you are racing against the computer.</p>\n<p>There are two basic modes: Grand Prix and Quest. Grand Prix consists of a multi-race points championship. There are two car types for this mode: F-3000 and F1. Grand Prix mode can be played with one or two players.</p>\n<p>Quest mode has more depth and forms the core of Final Lap Twin. This is essentially a racing RPG. You take the role of a boy who desires to become the World Champion. To do so, you must travel from town to town finding challenges and winning them to gain money and special items to improve your car. As you move around the game world, which is presented in an overhead view, you will encounter random challenges, much like random battles in a traditional RPG.</p>",

You choose your clubs before starting play, and the game automatically chooses what it feels is the best club for each shot. Before each shot you can view either a fly-by of the course or a close-up of the green and its contours. The game's courses scroll in multiple directions form an overhead view, and feature bunkers, trees, water hazards and all the rest. A three-press control system is used for playing shots, switching to a two-click once you reach the green (as draw and fade become irrelevant).</p>",

        "description": "<p>One day, Hany (sometimes known as Honey), who is a phallic <em>objet d'art</em> from stoneage Japan, is summoned by the god Izanaki. Izanaki is worried because his wife Izanami's heart has been invaded by a demon. His once peaceful wife now kills thousands of humans each day and threatens to destroy the world that she once created together with her husband. Hany must fly into Izanami's heart and destroy the demon.</p>\n<p>Once Hany has entered Izanami's heart, and you are put in control, it turns into a vertically-scrolling shoot'em up. One button fires the gun, but the other one rotates the gun clockwise, so that you may shoot at enemies coming from any direction. Hany is thus reminiscent of a flying tank. Hany starts out with only one life to spare and a weak weapon, usually giving few minutes of play before game over. However, each enemy shot gives spiritual power to Hany. Pressing the run button puts you in contact with Izanaki, who will let you trade in those power points in exchange for the usual assortment of power-ups, such as multiple shots. Izanaki will also grant you teleportation abilities, so that you may travel back and forth between levels.</p>",

He must find each level's key to proceed to the next one.</p>\n<p>Besides the updated graphics, this remake features a 3/4 view instead of the original top-down one. It also bears some RPG elements, as Gilgamesh gathers experience points for killing enemies, which are spent at the end of each level, to improve his stats (such as speed, health, etc.). He'll also find equipment such as swords, helmets, armors, shields, gauntlets and boots, which can be changed to better his stats, and will also find special items in hidden chests. The way to find theses chests is different for each floor. There are new treasures and new enemies.</p>\n<p>The game also features four different difficulty levels (easy, normal, hard and pro), as well as a password feature.</p>",

The first four stages are divided into 12 sub-stages or mazes. Each main level has its own objective, which basically consists of finding items in the mazes: collecting \"smilex\" components in the streets of Gotham, cleaning paintings at the museum, planting bombs at the factory and cutting off the ropes of Joker's balloons at the parade. Before each level, a cutscene with scenes from the movie is displayed.</p>\n<p>Batman can attack his enemies with his Batarang. Through the levels, he will collect items which will upgrade his speed and give his Batarang a longer range and multiple shots.</p>",

In seven levels, Son Goku has to survive various jumping puzzles, fight off enemies with his staff and collect money in form of fruit. Along the way, he can pick up various helpful items that can either be bought in stores or found hidden within the levels. They include: Medicine that refills Son Goku's health, a magic lamp that allows him to continue after losing a life, keys that open doors, a glove that breaks certain walls and a cloud that Son Goku can use to fly during boss-battles. Additionally, Son Goku can buy longer and more powerful staffs if he finds somebody who sells them.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Gomola Speed</em> is an action game featuring a robot snake. You must find the pieces of your body strewn about each maze-like stage, which increase your size, and use your length to surround items, food, and enemies in order to eliminate them. You can also use bombs to stun more dangerous enemies.</p>\n<p>Different stages may have different goals -- for example, you may have to find a key, or use your surround ability on floor tiles to reveal items or enemies. Only your snake's head is vulnerable; if an enemy hits your body it will scatter all the pieces and you'll have to collect them again. After completing set conditions on each stage, a door will open that leads to the next stage, at which point you'll be just a head again, and will have to hunt for your body once more.</p>\n<p>The game has the same unique <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=UPL\">UPL</a> style that will be familiar to fans of games such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/15437/atomic-robo-kid/\">Atomic Robo-Kid</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/98575/mutant-night/\">Mutant Night</a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p>One day, Doraemon and his friends went to go on a picnic. Using a time machine, they were going to visit the past to find a great place, but their plans were ruined by the evil Gigazombie, who has captured all of Doraemon's friends and trapped them in different time periods. Now, Doraemon must travel through time to rescue Nobita, Shizuka, Gian, and Suneo from Gigazombie's henchmen!</p>\n<p><em>Meiky\u016b Daisakusen</em> is an action puzzle game viewed from an overhead perspective. Each stage consists of a maze filled with various enemies and items. You must collect all of the keys on the stage to open the exit door while avoiding or eliminating enemies. Your primary method of dealing with enemies is to dig holes; if an enemy walks into a hole, they are momentarily trapped and you can then fill the hole to kill the enemy.</p>\n<p>You can also obtain temporary weapon powerups such as rayguns and yo-yos, as well as extend your digging reach to dig multiple holes at once. There are also several bosses encountered throughout the game.</p>\n<p>The game is a conversion of the 1987 Nichibutsu coin-op <em>Kid no Hore Hore Daisakusen</em>, which also saw a modified Famicom version called <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/26350/booby-kids/\">Booby Kids</a>. An unmodified conversion was released in North America as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/40868/cratermaze/\">Cratermaze</a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The story of this game is rather simple: the world is in peril, as the evil witch Topaz sends her seductive minions to terrorize the wilderness, plotting to overthrow the rightful king and conquer the world. A young prince is born, who is destined to be the one who slays Topaz. His first quest is to retrieve a magical armor which is essential for the victory. But the evil sexy female demons will do everything in their powers to stop the hero...</p>\n<p><em>Bodyconquest II</em> is in many ways a homage to the first <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9223/dragon-warrior/\"> Dragon Quest</a> game. The gameplay is nearly identical: the lone hero fights randomly appearing enemies in one-on-one battles, gains experience and money, gradually levels up, waits until he can afford better weapons and armor and venture into an area with stronger monsters, etc. Even the menu with commands such as \"Talk\" and \"Search\" is copied almost verbatim from the father of Japanese RPGs.</p>\n<p>The one distinguishing feature of this game is the sex appeal of the enemies. They are young, female, and tend to wear less than what we would usually associate with the medieval codex of modesty. </p>\n<p>Scantily clad girls, suggestive poses, and sexual innuendo abound; but no explicit scenes which would warrant an adult rating.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Nearing the end of the 21th century, human society entered a development stage that was dubbed \"neo capitalism\". Powerful mega-corporations built gigantic computer systems which were able to create entire virtual worlds, where humans sought refuge from the grim reality and the certainty of death. But crime flourished in the cyber world as well; a unit of special agents called \"cyber divers\" was created in order to fight criminal organizations. Syd is one of such cyber divers. His companion Ohala was once trapped in the cyber world and never returned. And now, another friend of his, the lovely Deva, tells him that she has been arrested while trying to investigate Ohala's disappearing. It's time for Syd to ride his flying bike and get to the bottom of the business - in real world as well as in the dangerous virtual reality.</p>\n<p><em>Down Load</em> is a side-scrolling shooter. The player controls Syd on his flying bike, which acts, for all purposes, like other aircrafts in comparable games. Before each mission, the player selects one of the two available main weapons: vulcan cannon (spreading fire, up to five directions if powered-up), and laser beam (powerful, focused fire; beams are added with power-ups). The secondary weapons include homing missiles, a bomb-like gadget, and a shield - all with limited ammunition/energy. </p>\n<p>The stages include real-world locations as well as abstract \"computer-like\" virtual reality worlds, with geometrical figures and computer-related objects as enemies. Boss enemies usually guard the exit to each level, and utilize a variety of shooting patterns to stop the hero. Anime-style cut scenes advance the story between the missions.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In this game, the player takes control of a young nameless traveler. One day, the hero meets a man who tells him a sad story: monsters have kidnapped his granddaughter, and locked her away in a tower. Apparently, the monsters also took away nine other young girls, and have some evil plans in mind. The hero agrees to venture into the tower's labyrinth and succeed where no other adventurer could...</p>\n<p><em>Lady Sword</em> is a first-person solo dungeon crawler. The player navigates the hero through the complex, maze-like corridors of the tower (with an auto-map feature), trying to find the right way to the stairs to the next floor. Fake walls, teleporters, one-way doors, items that must be collected to unlock hidden passages, boss enemies, etc., are there to make this task harder than it looks. Regular enemies pop out randomly, and must be defeated in a very simple turn-based combat. </p>\n<p>There is no damage feedback for the hero (though the player can see exactly how badly the hero himself is hurt), no weapons, armor, or items for combat usage. The player can heal the hero's wounds by selecting \"sleep\" from the menu. Sleeping restores the hero to full HP; but if he rests too much, a tough demon will appear and attack.</p>\n<p>Character growth is handled via direct stat increasing; there are no \"levels\", and the hero's HP, attack and defense power, as well as agility, increase gradually the more he fights.</p>\n<p>On each floor, a digitized photo of a young woman will greet the hero and encourage the player to explore further - at the stairs to the next floor, should the hero overcome all the obstacles, the player will be able to see the girl naked.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Necros no Y\u014dsai</em> is based on the characters from the eponymous Japanese toy line from the 1980s. The story tells of a world known as Tankirie, which was conquered by the evil warlock Necros; however, eight heroes (Knight, Mage, Amazon, Samurai, Elf, Dwarf, Berserker, and Mercenary) defeated him and restored peace. The game is divided into chapters; in the first one, the player takes control of the Mercenary, who is separated from his companions and is looking for a job. A search for a girl's missing father leads him to more dangerous discoveries, and eventually he has to reunite with his friends in order to face the evil once again.</p>\n<p>The player controls the Mercenary in the first chapter, but plays as other heroes as well (up to an active party of three) later in the game. The game is structured like a traditional top-down Japanese-style RPG, with random enemies and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Stand-out feature of the game are animated attacks: every attack in battle is presented as a short animated sequence, separate from the battle screen.</p>\n<p>Unlike most other RPGs of the time, <em>Necros no Y\u014dsai</em> does not feature a freely explorable \"world map\". Instead, player-controlled characters move in a strictly linear fashion to icons that represent towns and hostile areas.</p>",

However, map layout and locations are almost identical with those of the PC-88 version, hence being completely different from those of the MSX release.</p>\n<p>The most significant change - which is unique to this version - is the addition of a RPG system. Whereas in the two other versions the battles didn't serve any other purpose but challenge the player and impede the progress of the story, in the PC Engine (TurboGrafx-16) release they are essential to Laila's character growth. Like in most RPGs, Laila can now gain levels, which enhance her parameters and make her stronger in combat. When defeated, enemies leave orbs of various colors and chests; these serve to heal Laila, grant her experience points, \"mind points\" (to replenish her psychic abilities), or ammunition for the firearms.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The setting and the story of <em>Sindibad: Chitei no Daimaky\u016b</em> is inspired by the popular stories from the <em>1001 Nights</em>, though it does not follow any of them specifically, but rather uses popular names and brings together various heroes that had nothing to do with each other in the original stories. The titular character (more commonly spelled <em>Sinbad</em> in English) is a young boy who lives together with his father Alibaba and dreams of marrying the king's daughter Scheherazade. One night, they find out that the princess has been kidnapped; whoever rescues her receives a big prize and Scheherazade herself as a wife! Without further delay, Sindibad and Alibaba begin the perilous journey...</p>\n<p>The game is a traditional Japanese-style RPG with all the common ingredients of the genre: the player navigates Sindibad's party over a top-down world map, visiting towns and dungeons (represented as icons), fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, receiving money and experience points, buying better weapons and armor, leveling up automatically, and advancing the story in a linear fashion.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The game is based on the eponymous manga (sometimes transliterated as <em>Susa no Oh</em>) by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/355934/go-nagai/\"> Go Nagai</a>. The protagonist is a seemingly ordinary teenager named Susa, who discovers that he contains within himself another persona, the destructive Japanese god Susanoo. The game's story begins right where the manga ended (with a cliffhanger): Susa faces his rival Uryu, who causes him to unleash the power of Susanoo, devastating the world and releasing evil spirits that take it in their possession. Having returned to his normal self, Susa has to find his sweetheart Yukishiro and other friends, and figure out a way to undo the damage he has inflicted on the world.</p>\n<p><em>Susano\u014d Densetsu</em> is notable for implementing a setting and gameplay themes unusual for Japanese RPGs of its time. Among those is a day/night cycle, which influences the appearance of monsters on the world map as well as schedules of characters in the towns (for example, shops are closed at night). It is also one of the first Japanese RPGs in which enemies wander around visibly on the world map, sometimes surrounding the player, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Ultima\"> Ultima</a>-style, and can be avoided.</p>\n<p>The battle system is also reminiscent of <em>Ultima</em>, featuring free movement on the top-down battle screen. The fights are held in fast-paced turn-based style; to pause the fight, the player has to bring up the menu and select a command. Similarly to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Emerald+Dragon\"> Emerald Dragon</a>, action points are spent when moving and/or selecting commands.</p>\n<p>Later in the game Susa teams up with two other characters; he can also recruit mercenaries to help him in battles. Characters learn the so-called \"ESP powers\" when leveling up, which are equivalent to magic spells.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>City Hunter</em> is based on the eponymous manga by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/1003299/tsukasa-hojo/\">Tsukasa Hojo</a>. The story focuses on Ryo Saeba, a young man with a mysterious past, who founds the City Hunter team in Shinjuku, Tokyo. The City Hunter is an underground private detective agency, which takes care of particularly dangerous cases. In the game, the player is able to play through three of such cases, which are unrelated to each other and can be played in any order. </p>\n<p>The gameplay is essentially that of a side-scrolling shooter. The player navigates Ryo through the stages, dispatching of the frequently appearing enemies with his gun. The gameplay system is rather simple; multiple mission items may be carried but different weapons or power-ups are not available for use. The levels are usually designed as vast indoor areas, with many rooms Ryo can enter. The structure of the game also reveals mild adventure elements: often it is necessary to speak to a character, receive an item (such as a key), back-track to a previous area in order to reach a previously inaccessible room, etc.</p>",

A scientist who possesses the secret knowledge of psychic powers known as ESP, imbues a young boy with them, and sends him to the streets and underground caverns of Tokyo, to rescue the few remaining survivors, and find out the source of the monstrous invasion!</p>\n<p><em>Energy</em> is a modified version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/59054/ashe/\">Ashe</a>. Basic gameplay, main areas and overall game progression remain intact. However, some story segments have been altered, and location layout is quite different in certain areas. The player manipulates the young hero, who can shoot energy balls and jump. The energy attacks deplete his ESP bar, which refills itself gradually afterwards. The hero's life bar can only be refilled with healing potions which are sometimes dropped by the enemies. The boy can also collect items which change the properties or his ESP attack, and/or upgrade these attacks to the next level.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>World Court Tennis</em> is a tennis game with a twist. The action itself features no big surprises: the players control their characters over the scrolling tennis field and try to counter balls from their opponents. It is possible to perform typical tennis actions like cross, smash or lob and the hit performance depends on the timing.</p>\n<p>However, the unique feature of this game is a story mode which takes various elements from Japanese role-playing games. The story involves an evil king who banned all tennis matches outside of membership courts. The player goes out to overthrow the king so tennis can be brought back to everyone. So the player explores a top-down world map reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dragon+Warrior\">Dragon Warrior</a>, explores the surrounding and fights enemies. Those fights are either random encounters or scripted boss battles and play out as regular tennis matches.</p>\n<p>The overall goal is to find all membership courts and defeat the inhabitants. Because of this, the game does not end when defeated; the player gets dragged to the king and has to pay a penalty fee. Money is the only resource and is earned by defeating enemies. It is used to buy updated equipment: shoes improve speed, rackets improve power and shirts help to evade random encounters. The game is no RPG, however, because there is no actual character development.</p>",

It is similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/12191/knight-rider/\">NES version</a>, but is played in a third-person perspective. The player takes control over KITT, the speaking car.</p>\n<p>The main goal of the game is to finish each course within a time limit. However, the presence of other cars and trucks (which may shoot at KITT or are simply in the way) make this difficult. Those can be overcome by either shooting them with one of the build-in weapon systems, jumping over them with the turbo boost or simply passing by. It is also important to keep on the road because ramming against lamp posts is unhealthy. KITT's abilities can be upgraded during the course of the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Battle Royale</em> is a wrestling game that presents last-man-standing type battles between up to five wrestlers. </p>\n<p>The game features three difficulty settings, five wrestlers to choose from, and two game modes. For single players only is the tournament mode, featuring 15 possible consecutive battles, beginning with one-on-ones and continuing up to a full five-man match. In the second mode, the number of competitors can be freely set for a single match. There is a catch in how a player chooses their wrestler, though: before the match, the fighters' managers duke it out on their way to select their favorite fighter - temporarily knocking out the opposition is encouraged.</p>\n<p>The matches take place in a side view of the ring. The A and B buttons are used for a variety of kicks and punches and the Select button can be used for an extra powerful attack. The goal is to toss the opponents out of the ring and remain the last man standing.</p>\n<p>The single match mode can be played by up to five human players.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Takin' it to the Hoop</em> is a basketball game with comic graphics. The player either participates in a league, play-offs or a single match and chooses one of eight American teams with twelve athletes. The team's performance during a match does not only depend on the player's ability but also on the athlethe's statistics (e.g. agility or dribbling) and their energy. Energy decreases during the course of a match and describes how much power an athlete has left. There are also three different defense tactics (one-on-one defense, zone defense or a mix between the two) which can be set before the match or during interceptions.</p>\n<p>During the matches, the player controls the ball carrier when in offense and manually switches between athletes when in defense. Passes can be performed in a high or low variation. While most of the match is shown in a slightly heightened side-scrolling perspective, the game switches to a close-up view during a penalty throw or a dunking try. Here the player needs to press a button at the correct timing for a successful throw. When a defense athlete is nearby during a during maneuver, he has the opportunity to block the ball when the correct timing is met.</p>",

The tournament consists of four fights and a finale and each boxer can be controlled by a human player. The boxers have different statistics (strength, agility and endurance) which can be improved between fights with a training fight. Each boxer has four moves (left swing, right swing, uppercut and dodge) and a hit both depletes the opponent's energy bar and gives points. Similar to real boxing, those points are used to determine the winner if no boxer is knocked out during the regular rounds. A knockout happens when the energy runs out, but when the player mashes a button fast enough when the boxer is given a count, he stands up again with a partly replenished energy bar. </p>\n<p>Additionally there is also a side-scrolling fighting game included. Here the player walks from left to right and fights enemies in martial arts melee combat.</p>",

The player takes the role of a young athlete who takes part in the motorcycle World Grand Prix. Every race consists of a qualifying and the race itself, the goal of course being to gather a good position in the end. The game also features some basic bike customization in which the player can change the tires, brakes, engine, suspension or mission before a race. The weather influences the bike's performance and handling, depending on the bike parts and the course. Additionally there is a travel mode in which the 16 courses can be chosen freely.</p>",

Every player (including the goalie) can be controlled. On offense, quick shots, slap shots and even faked slap shots are possible. On defense, body checking an opposing player can lead to a special fight sequence.</p>\n<p>Exhibition games can be played with either full or easy rules - easy mode has less penalties and infractions like offside. In tournaments, every scheduled game can either be played or the results simulated. Tournament progress is saved via a password. When two or more players play, they can be put on any team. Thus teams featuring five human players are just as possible as mixed competitive matches.</p>",

Those boxes have to pushed into certain places of the level which are marked. However, the player character can only push a box; pulling is out of the question.

The five levels are similarly built as the ones in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7300/super-mario-bros-3/\">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>: they are divided into various areas which are reached through a map screen with branching paths. Those areas need to be solved to be able to walk further on the map. </p>\n<p>The speciality of this game is that the player can switch between three characters with different abilities on the fly, e.g. one can jump high and another has a better gun. Those are important to be able to solve the challenges the levels bring, mostly consisting of traditional platforming and avoiding/shooting enemies. However, the boss area at the end of the level map has to be opened with a master key. There is one hidden in every area.</p>\n<p>The three characters are based on characters of the series and change depending on the level. The health pool is shared between all characters and losing all hearts results in losing a life. Hearts can be refilled by collecting money which is left behind by killed enemies.</p>",

Another difference is that the levels scroll.</p>\n<p>This is a platformer in which the protagonist needs to collect all gold which is spread out over the levels. Unfortunately there are a lot of enemies roaming around which should be avoided. The protagonist can't jump and so he needs to resort to ladders and horizontal ropes for dodging. The only way to temporarily get rid of a guard is to make a hole in the ground where they can't get out when falling in. After a certain amount of time a hole is filled up and a trapped guard respawns.</p>",

The player takes the role of a volleyball team with two athletes (which have different strengths and disadvantages) and tries to win a tournament. The second athlete can also be played by a second human player. The controls offer no surprises: players move an athlete over the field and use two buttons for jumping and hitting. Single players also have to switch between the two athletes.</p>\n<p>However, each athlete has a n energy value which decreases over the course of a match. By using a water bottle the energy gets filled up again, but there is only a limited amount available. When using the training mode instead of the tournament, players can choose between one of three fields and an easy mode which is basically a slow motion mode.</p>",

There are six levels which also scroll slightly up and down and end with a big end boss. Some of those levels are a bit gimmicky, e.g. one level has a lot of water movement in the background which makes it harder to keep an overview and level five is a fast scrolling maze system in which the player needs to take the correct paths to avoid dead ends (and therefore certain death). </p>\n<p>Of course there are also power ups to collect: depending on their colour, they stand for a different weapon system (overall five) like lasers or rings which circle around the ship and make it harder to crush against the environment. Collecting multiple symbols of the same colour upgrades the current weapon up to two times. The game features three difficulty levels and a rapid fire option.</p>",

Those sets have a difficulty level associated with them and each rewards the same ending when solved. The other two modes are the challenge mode (solving ten levels in a limited amount of time) and a split-screen multiplayer mode.</p>",

Now they head into their ships, fly through the vertically scrolling levels and kill everything they see, including several boss enemies. Killed enemies leave behind power ups which reward five extra weapons, e.g. missiles or drones, which can be used simultaneously or a smart bomb equivalent. The player has a health bar which decreases when the ship is hit by enemies and when it is completely empty, the game is over because there are no continues or extra lives. Similarly, the death of one players ends the game when using the co-operational multiplayer mode.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Obocchama-kun</em> is an action game based on the TV anime of the same name (which itself is based on a manga). Winning the game is basically achieved by getting to the end of each level and beating the boss (sometimes replaced by another special challenge). Of course there are also a variety of enemies (two different per level) running around which try to harm the protagonist. He has two weapons to use against them: either shooting them or, well, jumping in their face with his buttocks. There are also power ups to collect, e.g. weapon upgrades or summoning an ally which supports him through the rest of the stage. The protagonist also has the ability to transform himself, e.g. into a dog or a blind man.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Zero4 Champ</em> is a racing simulation game inspired by Japanese urban street racing, its name derived from the traditional racing distance (0 to 400 meters). A versus mode allows players to compete against each other or computer AI in first-person-view races; however, the game's main mode is the Story Mode, which has strong simulation elements. The player takes the role of a young racer, competing in tournaments and gradually advancing in rank. It is possible to buy car parts or whole vehicles, as well as customize cars. Money is obtained from prizes or by doing part-time jobs. These jobs are sometimes designed as mini-games; for example, working as a security guard involves inspecting rooms in a first-person environment. It is also possible to play simple arcade games such as UFO catcher or Turbo Racing.</p>",

Unfortunately he opens a seal which causes monsters to come into the world. Now he needs to cross six levels (each with a boss) while avoiding to lose all life energy. The levels are side-scrolling with horizontal movement involved. Besides dodging by jumping, the player character has two standard ways to deal with enemies: using the unlimited vampire breath (works like a gun) or using tomatoes as bombs which have to be found first. The enemies leave behind various power-ups when killed, e.g. energy, extra lives or armor.</p>",

Several years after the happenings in <em>Cyber Cross</em>, a new threat threatens Earth: Duma and his alien forces. Wiber now starts his counter-attack on Duma.</p>\n<p>This game is a side-scrolling action game with emphasis on combat, but also with some platforming sequences. The player has the ability to switch between four forms: human and three robot suits. All those forms have different abilities, e.g. one robot has a special gun and the human can only kick to attack but is the only form which has a special attack taking up a bit of life energy. The power-ups which can be collected during play have different effects depending on the used form, e.g. as human everything gives life energy and as robots there are weapon and armor upgrades as well as ammo.</p>",

Fish Attack Sub is on its way to blast through four scenes of swimming terror and stop the aliens from taking over the sea. Fortunately, the A.N.G.E.L. is helped on its way by a number of power-ups - for instance, Healing Power completely repairs the sub and Speed Power speeds it up. Up to three modes of attack can be used to combat the mutant fish - the starting Pulse Shot, the destructive Swirl Cutter, and the Bubble Beam. But the A.N.G.E.L. is not indestructible. Four colors on the A.N.G.E.L.'s eye indicate the amount of damage the sub has sustained, and when it's had enough and explodes, that's the end of the A.N.G.E.L. and the end of the game.</p>",

The gameplay remains largely the same - the player takes control of Alice who must shoot bubbles at enemies to knock them off platforms. Unlike the arcade original which was in isometric perspective, M\u00e4rchen Maze on the PC Engine is an overhead game. This version features different stages than the arcade game, and because of the lack of a time limit, many of the stages are much more expansive. The chequered platforms at the end of a level are static rather than moving, hopping on to them automatically takes you to the boss. Also, instead of starting from a checkpoint when you die, your lives are represented by balloons. Should Alice fall, you'll be respawned on the spot.</p>",

The game is very similar in concept to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1301/battle-chess-ii-chinese-chess/\">Battle Chess II: Chinese Chess</a> (Shogi is the Japanese counterpart of the Chinese XiangQi) or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1950/battle-chess/\">Battle Chess</a>. The player can play in special graphic mode where all figures are animated with various monsters like slimes, frogs, skeletons or minotaurs. During encounters fight animations are shown. The gameplay is generally identical to other Shogi games. The player controls various figures on a 9x9 board and tries to defeat an opponent. Each figure has its own rules for movement and attack.</p>",

The player controls a female pilot (presented only in several cut-scenes) controlling a prototype CS-05 tank. The tank can freely be moved around the screen in any direction and the game scrolls along until the edge of the area is reached. The tank needs to destroy enemies and locate the exit. There are several weapons such as lasers, homing missiles, mines, a force field etc. The tank's turret can be locked into one position to shoot, so it is possible to strafe. Sometimes the player must destroy all the enemies or a boss to progress. The game has seven levels in totals and many parts of the levels are mazes.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Spectrum HoloByte's series of hardcore flight simulations makes its only appearance on a console with <em>Falcon</em> for TurboGrafx. Owing to the limited control options, the game is more action and less simulation, but still opts for a certain amount of realism.</p>\n<p>Players control an F-16 Falcon in combat against a terrorist group planning to construct a nuclear bomb. Before the main campaign, several training scenarios allow the practice of bombing ground targets, intercepting bombers, engaging in dogfights and facing flak guns or SAM sites. The same kinds of scenarios are faced in the campaign. Before taking off, players can outfit their plane with the correct weapons for the mission at hand, including various realistic models of air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles and bombs as well as ECM pods and extra fuel tanks.</p>\n<p>Takeoffs and landings are taken care of automatically. Gameplay is seen through a cockpit perspective patterned after a real F-16, with the environment and air and ground targets rendered as flat-shaded polygons. The directional pad is used to steer the plane, Select to change weapons and Button II to fire. Button I is a multi-purpose button that changes the functions of the other buttons, allowing the pilot to set the throttle, bank, shift the radar lock, and fire countermeasures. Realistic features during flight include red and blackouts, and of course, stalls and crashes.</p>\n<p>The game features a high score table and saves mission progress via passwords (or to battery-backed RAM with a Turbo Booster Plus). A unique feature is a head-to-head mode supported on TurboExpress handhelds via Turbo Link cable.</p>",

Players are displayed as little cars driving on a road track, symbolizing a whole life from birth to death. Each turn players have to spin a wheel, determining the number of fields the player advances on the \"board\", which will almost always result in an event. Events can either be positive or negative, mostly influencing your account balance. In the course of the game, players will take on a profession, marry and might get children. The game ends when every player reaches the retirement phase. The player who is wealthiest by then wins the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Champions Forever Boxing</em> is a boxing game licensed from the 1989 documentary about the sport, featuring the likenesses of five all-time greats: Ali, Foreman, Frazier, Holmes and Norton. Players can both control the legendary boxers or measure up against them in the ring.</p>\n<p>The game includes single player exhibition and career modes, a two-player versus mode and an auto-play mode which sees AI boxers taking each other on for demonstration. Career mode starts in 1968 and lasts up to fifteen years, with one fight per year, taking into account the actual historical standings of the featured boxers. In career mode, all fights last 12 rounds, while in the other modes the number of rounds can be set between 3 and 12.</p>\n<p>Fights are shown from the side of the ring. Controls allow for five different punches: Button II launches a jab, while button I in combination with a direction button enables left and right hooks, a body blow and an uppercut. Pressing Run blocks high, Run + Down blocks low. Clinching is possible when in close proximity and it is also possible to taunt the opponent with a showboating move. Strength and stamina meters show the condition of the boxer: the opponent landing a blow lowers strength, throwing punches lowers stamina. When strength is depleted, the boxer is knocked down and must button-mash to get back up, the difficulty of which increases with each knockdown.</p>\n<p>Rounds last 3 minutes. Between rounds, the corner screen appears for 30 seconds, showing judges' scores, statistics about punches landed, successful blocks and knockdowns made and a visualization of the damage to the boxers' faces. In the 30 seconds, it is possible to either regain strength or stamina or to increase the power of certain punches.</p>\n<p>Progress in career mode is stored via password or backup memory on a TurboGrafx-CD or with a TurboBooster-Plus.</p>",

Someone has to travel to his manor and destroy the overlord, a job falling to young Arthur.</p>\n<p><em>Ghost Manor</em> is a horror-themed platform game in which players control Arthur on his quest for the manor. It consists of several large levels, including the road to the manor and various rooms inside, including hallways, storerooms and cellars. To move on to the next stage, Arthur usually has to find a key that opens the exit door. This might be hidden in some corner or only appear once a certain monster is defeated. To defeat enemies, Arthur uses a magic orb that fires projectiles. Ammunition is limited but can be restored through a power-up. Arthur can also find stars which increase the shot power, hearts that restore lost health, extra lives, and various special items used to tackle obstacles in his way. Not all enemies are harmful: some can be utilized to carry Arthur around the level or catapult him to a place he can't otherwise reach.</p>",

You pilot a realistic jet against other realistic enemies, jets, tanks and so on.</p>\n<p>For the power-up system you collect items dropped by certain enemies (the red ones like in <em>Area 88</em>) that consist of speed up or down or a regular power-up for the main shot. You can also collect several special weapons more powerful than the regular straight-forward bullets or ground-bombing shots. Special weapons include smart bombs, a time limited invulnerability, a sort of after-image effect, homing missiles and other kinds of attacks. When you use them your jet also backfires, attacking enemies coming from behind. You cannot cycle between the special weapons and you can only use them in the order you picked them.</p>\n<p>Your airplane has several life segments. Simple bosses await at the end of each stage. They are quite small, except a huge ship in a bay or the last boss. The screen scrolls slowly. The game difficulty spikes a lot in the last two stages where you need to avoid a lot of obstacles. At the end of each stage you are rated not only on how you performed but also according to how many special weapons you used or kept in stock.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>B\u014dken Danshaku Don: The Lost Sunheart</em> is a 2D side-scrolling flying shooter with a basic structure, but with some peculiar elements. Enemies have many fantasy elements. For instance, the first boss Shinjuku Kid is a huge red-skinned baby with a spine made of eyeballs.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the game you may choose to play it in story mode or not. The story mode contains cut-scenes between stages that can also be skipped by pressing a button. There is an easy and a hard mode available, and only three continues.</p>\n<p>The basic structure is like the majority of side-scrolling shmups, you progress until the end of the stage where you fight a boss. During the stages you collect several power-ups, special items, 1-ups and life restocks (the ship has a life gauge). Power-ups and items are released by destroying some kind of strange bouncing and rotating chess pieces, but a couple are mandatory and released by certain bosses.</p>\n<p>At some points of the game you change ships, with just aesthetic differences, they do not have different stats.\nProgressing through the game (at the beginning you have none) you receive 5 auxiliary \"option\" weapons, you may equip and change them at will pausing the game and choosing them in a small menu.</p>\n<p>On top of the screen level's name and during boss fights also boss's name are displayed (as well as your ship's and boss's life gauges). There is no damage in hitting floors and walls, but if you get caught in a wall scrolling out it's instant death, and when you loose a ship you loose also special items and your shot power rank goes down.\nDespite the \"chapter\" reference in Japanese title, there are not other games before of following this one.</p>",

You play as Minty Geile, a girl piloting a type of robot-suit called YF-25 Algideross. The gameplay is similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Leynos\">Leynos</a> games. You move and shoot with your mecha around a sort of big maze, occasionally confronting bosses. The mecha can shoot only horizontally so you need to jump and fly to hit enemies at different heights. Wandering around you will find some transition rooms where you receive some info and hint from your superiors and where you find pods where you may gain new features, new weapons, restore health and so on.</p>\n<p>The story is not elaborated on, as there is not a single word about it in the game or in the manual. The mecha and character design is done by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/61968/masamune-shirow/\">Masamune Shirow</a> (<em>Ghost in the Shell</em>, <em>Appleseed</em>).</p>",

In each level the playfield is split into 4 separate paths. Hani can move freely between paths. The paths themselves are littered with pits that can be jumped and enemies which need to be kicked. Also on the paths are items like blue jars (collecting 25 will earn Hany an extra life), mystery jars which are worth varying points, rockets, trampolines, among others.</p>\n<p>Hany can't take all day to complete a level as there is a countdown timer that will cost Hany a life if he takes to long. Luckily there are a few time clocks scattered around which will put more time on the clock when collected.</p>",

It was followed by <em>Mahjong Gok\u016b Tenjiku</em>, four years later, by the same developer.</p>\n<p>The player can choose to play one of the four characters from Xi You Ji: the famous Sun Wukong (a Monkey King called Sun Gok\u016b in Japan, hence the title of the game), the pig Bajie, and two other \"animals\" (a dragon and a bird). It is a classic mahjong game with RPG elements, so Sun Gok\u016b must make his way across a map, facing enemies at every stop. The only way to progress in the adventure is to defeat the enemies by winning at the mahjong table.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Sh\u014dgi Shoshinsha Muy\u014d</em> is a sh\u014dgi simulation game. It was created by Home Data with supervision from the Japan Sh\u014dgi Association. The player can choose from AI difficulty levels 1 to 8. However, the effectiveness of the AI depends on the time limit set for it. For example, if you give it a short amount of time to think, it won't have time to think of as good of a move as if you gave it a very long or infinite time limit.</p>\n<p>In addition, the game also has a Tsume Sh\u014dgi mode for players to enjoy. The player can select from 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15-move Tsume Sh\u014dgi problems. The game also has a mode to watch eight historical sh\u014dgi matches. This way, the player can study the games and learn and strengthen their skills. If the player wishes to learn from their own mistakes, they can do so by using the replay mode at the end of a game. This mode allows the player to go to any move at any time of the game just played.</p>\n<p>During the game, there are various settings that can be changed. These include flipping the board, changing the board and piece design, and whether or not to have audio or voice. Through an external device such as the PC Engine Memory Base 128, the player can save their progress to one of several game save slots and load them for later play.</p>",

There are four modes the game can be played including the one player, versus, edit and tournament modes. To progress through the tournament, the player has to beat all three rivals on each section of the stadium. Before each match the player can allocate points to change the PC's speed, power or armor. In later stages the player will have the opportunity to equip front and rear weapons. The player fights opponents in a race track styled arena, avoiding incoming obstacles while engaging the current opponent. Obstacles can be used against the opponent.</p>",

Combat takes the form of picking one several tactics (defense, magic, attack or special move) and a randomly generated number which indicates how effect the tactic will be. Likewise the demon will also have their own chosen tactic and random number. The player gets the upper hand if the random number is higher than the opponent's.
