        "description": "<p><em>Exorcist</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a> variant. The player takes control of Sparkie, a blobby yet spikey character who is lost in the haunted catacombs beneath the ruins of an old monastery. Ghosts and other nasty creatures wander around the corridors of the catacombs and now Sparkie has to find a way to escape. </p>\n<p>Unlike Pac-Man, Exorcist doesn't feature any pills that has to be collected. Instead the idea here is to illuminate all of the walls of the mazes. This is done automatically as the player moves Sparkie through the corridors. When a maze is fully lit the ghosts will be exorcised and a number of exits will open up and the player can move on to other mazes. All mazes are connected to each other and the player can move back and forth between them. If Sparkie comes into contact with the ghosts he will have to restart the maze and he will lose some of his energy. When all energy is lost the game is over. </p>\n<p>It is possible to shoot at the ghosts by picking up lightning that can be found in each maze. This causes the ghosts to slow down but it can only be used for a few second before it disappears. Energy can be replenished by shooting the exorcised ghosts.</p>",

There are 16 waves of aliens to blast and all aliens must be destroyed on each level to move to the next. Be careful not to over use your cannon as it can overheat and then you will have to wait for it to cool. A gauge on the right of the playing area shows your gun temperature. You can select from one to four lives and it is game over when all are lost.</p>",

Before you play the match there are various options you can select which are difficulty (1-4), how many sets (1-3) and speed of the match (1-4). The actual match is viewed from above with the whole court shown on the screen. The player serving presses the fire button and the serve is played automatically. The player returning the ball can move around the court and when they want to hit the ball they hold down the fire button (the longer held the harder the shot) and when it is let go this hits the ball. The direction the ball goes is the position of the player when they hit the ball. All the normal rules and scoring for tennis are used.</p>",

Problem is before he died he made sure it was also full of traps and creatures due to the lack of you visiting him over the years. So off you go to risk life and limb to become a rich man. </p>\n<p><em>Varmit</em> is a flick-screen platform game where you must explore each mine one at a time to collect ten bits of gold to clear the mine. Each mine is made up of three levels with ladders connecting certain levels, so you have to go back to previous screens to get the gold. There are also bonus items to collect for extra points. There are many hazards like bats, carts and falling rocks, and if any touch you then it's back to the entrance of the mine with the loss of one of your four lives. You keep everything collected though.</p>\n<p>Later levels have walls blocking routes and even fake gold. You need to collect the gold as quick as possible as a river flows underneath the mine and after a short time it slowly rises flooding the mine. A joystick or keyboard can be used to control your miner.</p>",

Trying to stop you are the Acid Apple Gang who wander around the orchard and one touch from them loses one of five lives but you can fire at them to kill them. Walking through the dirt creates a path which the Gang can walk on but they can't walk through the dirt themselves. Be careful walking under apples as well as you have a very short time before it falls on top of you. Collect all the cherries on the level and you move to the next one. The whole level is shown on one screen and as well as the main playing area you can also see your score, time, Bonus, lives, level and a high score table.</p>",

You still have the <em>Sword of Destiny</em> so you decide that you will descend into the depths of the Warlock's lair, The Abyss of Death and get your heart back. You must fight off evil nasties as well as find flashing objects which open up more of the Abyss. Scattered around are small volcano type mounds and when you jump on them they allow you to jump up higher. Touch any nasty or fall from a height then your Astral power bar will decrease slightly.

        "description": "<p>You are here in your Corastron Ship to save the galaxy after scientists on the planet Sistasis blew up the planet trying to discover what made the planets core active and now dangerous Plastron Boulders are loose. The game is split into three stages with each stage played on one screen as you try to control the boulders.</p>\n<p>Stage One: There are three coloured boulders bouncing around the screen and the yellow and purple boulders must be directed into their home slots while the grey boulder will disrupt the stage but is needed when the coloured boulders are in their slots. You must move around the screen and shoot the two coloured home slots until they turn lighter and finally start flashing. When the yellow home slot is flashing your ship turns into a bat. You must now direct the two coloured boulders into the slots at a clean 45 degree angle. If a boulder is in it's slot and the grey boulder touches it then the boulder starts bouncing around the screen again. Once both coloured boulders are home then you must direct the grey boulder into all four corners. The coloured boulders can still be knocked out of their slots. Your energy gauge is just the yellow and purple bars and you lose energy when you touch any boulder. Once both gauges are empty then it is game over.</p>\n<p>Stage Two: You now have four different coloured boulders bouncing around and the aim is to keep shooting the force field bit by bit until it disappears from the top or bottom of the screen. You can move around the whole screen but can't hit the force field from the sides. While shooting you must avoid touching any boulder as this will lose part of your energy bar. You now have four parts of your energy gauge and once again it's game over when it is empty. The more of the force field you destroy the more boulders that enter the screen.</p>\n<p>Stage Three: The final stage will see you trying to round up six different coloured boulders by shooting each boulder in the correct sequence. When the correct boulder is weakened by your constant shooting it jumps up the line to the next boulder. Keep doing this until you weaken the last coloured boulder. There are other coloured boulders but don't react to your shooting and is just wasting time shooting them. A red boulder will bounce around the screen and if you touch it then the line of boulders reset and you have to start again. You have a full gauge and touching boulders decreases it and it is game over when it is empty.</p>\n<p>Between each stage is a bonus round to build up your score. Pick up pods to make yourself bigger and when happy with your size (this dictates the amount of boulders as well) you can move into the playing screen and try to deflect boulders into your character to score points. When your energy gauges are empty you move on to the next stage. A joystick is used to control your ship.</p>",

The shark swims at the top of the screen while you can only move left and right on the bottom. You must fire a harpoon upwards to kill him. As you play a level, your air gauge decreases and if you don't kill the shark by the time it reaches zero then you lose one of three lives. As the levels progress then there are other sea creatures to be aware of like eels, fish and squid. These have to be avoided and can't be shot and when touched then you lose a life.</p>",

The game is flick-screen with each cavern shown on the whole screen viewed from the side with a passage connecting other caverns. You control the airship with your joystick and when you move the airship it keeps moving until you move the joystick in the opposite direction to slow it down and even stop.</p>\n<p>Hitting any part of the cavern and walls gives you a damage point and when you collect ten then it is game over but rescue a geologist and it is reduced. As you explore and fly through the caverns there is a clock counting down showing the water level and as the clock gets lower, caverns will flood killing the men. If you touch the water then it is game over. Once you collect all 28 geologists and return to the surface you then attempt the next level which is the same layout but now introduces acid droplets which increase your damage. There are eight levels in total and each one introduces more acid and makes them fall faster.</p>\n<p>As well as the main playing area you can also see your score, damage, ship-depth, hi-score, bonus for geologists rescued and the water depth. Before you play the game you can select which level to play and the control sensitivity of the airship.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Project Nova</em> is a 1st person shooter where you are the pilot of a space craft and you must explore various sectors to find alien ships and destroy them. Before you play the game you can select which level you want to start on (1-8). You start the game looking out into empty space inside the cockpit of your craft with the option to look out from the rear. On your instrument panel which is shown on the top and bottom of the screen is your energy status, speed, your rating, shield status, view and how many hostiles in the area. Pressing 0-9 on the keyboard controls your speed but uses up energy so must be used carefully. Pressing F1, F2 or F3 activates your shield from Green (No Shield), Amber (20% capacity) and Red (Full) which also requires the use of energy.</p>\n<p>Pressing C brings up your ships computer which gives a status report on various parts of your craft and a map of the area containing all the sectors. Each sector contains a number telling you how many hostiles are in that area and also which ones contain energy to top up your energy supply. These sectors can still contain alien ships. You move a cursor onto the sector you require to explore and press H for hyperspace. Once you are in the sector you use the joystick to control your craft to move a laser sight and pressing fire to fire a laser. You are also able to repair your ship if you receive damage but receive to much and it is game over.</p>",

Viewed from the side as the screen scrolls left and right when you move, <em>Petals of Doom</em> has you having to blast the creatures that dwell in the caverns, making sure they don't stamp on the plants. Before you play the game you decide how many lives you require from one to six.</p>\n<p>As you protect each plant, they will grow over time, and when all have grown you can move to the next cavern but will shrink when touched by an alien. The growth of the plants is indicated by a bar and when it empties then the plants have fully grown. Another bar to watch is your power bar and this decreases if you touch an alien, fire your laser or fly your jet-pack and when empty you lose a life but will increase if you aren't touched or don't use your laser or jet-pack. When tall enough, the plants can be stood behind and the aliens can't touch you. A radar at the top of the screen shows the location of any aliens and the keyboard or joystick is used to control your hero.</p>",

As you are pushing counters, sinners move about the pathways from a sin bin and if you touch one then you lose time and it is game over when the time runs out.

The game is a maze game viewed from above with each maze shown on the whole screen and you must control a craft killing all the Megabolt's ships that move about the maze. To kill them you can either shoot them with your laser or you can crush them with part of a wall which you fire at to move. There is also a spinning yellow craft that moves about the maze and this can't be shot just avoided. Touch this spinning craft or a Megabolt and you lose one of six lives. </p>\n<p>As you move about the maze you have a fuel gauge which is slowly decreasing and when this runs out you lose a live but you can collect moving orange diamonds to increase it. As well as the main playing area you can also see your score, lives, high score, how many Megabolts to destroy in that maze, your grid location and an alert which tells you which grids still have Megabolts active.</p>",

You must navigate the various platforms attempting to collect all the keys to the safe before finding the exit. There are various creatures roaming around the screen as well who don't want their money taken and if you touch one then you lose one of seven lives and the screen you're on has to be started again. To move up and down platforms there are poles that you can only use in the direction it is moving and there are also lifts to move to other parts of the screen. Once you have opened the safe and collected the money, before exiting you must make sure all the platforms have been changed from black to white.</p>",

As soon as you are sitting on the chaser then your energy decreases and you must destroy a certain amount of Tycons to move to the next level.

If you touch a guard or its weapon then you lose one of five lives.</p>\n<p><strong>Destructor:</strong> Your mission in this side view single screen game is to protect Earth from a Metanoid Ship in your MKII Destructor Ship. You sit on the bottom of the screen moving left or right, and you must hit the Metanoid Ship ten times to destroy it but the Metanoid drops bombs as it moves left to right and back again on the top of the screen. You must keep moving because if you stay still for too long then you will be destroyed and if you are destroyed or hit by a bomb then you lose one of five lives. Once the ship is destroyed then another one appears but lower down the screen.</p>\n<p><strong>Asteroid Belt:</strong>  In this side view single screen game, your spacecraft sits on the top of the screen in an asteroid field. You must move left or right as various size asteroids move up the screen and must be avoided. If you touch an asteroid then you lose one of three lives but you do have three shields which protect you when activated for a short time.</p>",

Problem is, the Xargon's have been warned you are coming and so have sent all their Warriors to defend the planets against your attack. <em>Xargon's Revenge</em> is a shooter viewed from the side on a single screen for each planet. You sit on the left on the screen blasting the Warriors who move from right to left in unpredictable patterns and if you touch one then you lose one of five lives. Every Warrior must be destroyed on each screen to progress to the next but it has to be done before your fuel gauge runs out. Fuel capsules though occasionally bounce towards you and if collected increase your fuel as running out of fuel loses a life.</p>",

After two weeks of constant programming and coke and coffee, Arthur has finally finished the game but with lack of sleep he has finally succumbed to the Sandman. In his dreams, Arthur is Rounit Hard, Commander of the Imperial Bat, and is actually starring in his game. Arthur needs to complete 32 levels (including bonus levels) so he can wake up from his deep sleep.</p>\n<p>The game is based on the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1087/arkanoid/\">Arkanoid</a> and sees you controlling a bat on the bottom of the screen, bouncing a ball upwards to remove blocks above. As you remove the blocks, a barrel will appear and fall downwards and if collected will give you a power-up and these include large bat, shoot blocks, 3 balls, slow ball and an extra bat. Occasionally a Floboid moves across the screen and if hit with the ball will give you bonus points. If you let the ball go past the bat then you lose one of six lives and you have to clear all the blocks to move to the next level.</p>",

Once you have succeeded to rebuild Apollo 16, you must collect Satellites over the surface so you can return home to Earth. The first part of the game is a platform game with the screen scrolling left or right when you move to collect the pieces and you can move up to the higher platforms using your Jet-Pack. As you search, you will encounter many aliens and these need avoiding or shooting with your laser because if you touch one then you lose one of three lives. All movements also decrease your energy which is shown by a gauge at the bottom of the screen. The second part of the game has you viewing your Shuttle from the side and you must control an arm to collect the Satellites.</p>",

The screen scrolls left or right constantly in the direction you are travelling. You must fly over the sea and survive every day and night until it is found while avoiding and shooting enemy planes. At the top of the screen is a radar which shows you the position of the enemy planes and as you fight the day slowly turns to night and back again. Flying decreases a fuel gauge slowly but once night turns back to day you have a chance to re-fuel with another plane by flying behind it. If you are shot by a plane or touch one, then you lose one of seven shields and if they run out or your fuel then it is game over.</p>",

The Teddies can be destroyed but the Drones can only be stunned and if you touch the Teddies or Drones then you lose one of five lives. If you stand at the top of the screen in the red zone, no more Teddies will appear and once all the blocks are painted then you move to the next screen. There are five skill levels to choose from and they are Duffer, Novice, Normal, Expert and Master.</p>",

You take control of the person responsible as you move around the flick-screen maze in your Terror Tank collecting keys to get deeper into the city. Your first task is to collect 21 keys to enter the Inner Sanctum, then collect four keys to enter the Heart of the Inner Sanctum, before you have to collect ten keys to enter the Sacred Treasure Chamber. The keys are protected by protective blocks and these need blasting to remove them. As you explore the city you will encounter Berks and Drones, the Berks can be destroyed with your laser but the Drones can only be stunned. If you touch a Berk, Drone or a protective block then you lose one of five lives. There are five skill levels to choose from and they are Duffer, Novice, Normal, Expert and Master.</p>",

Inspired by the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Green+Beret\">Green Beret</a>, your marine is viewed from the side and you run along to the right killing as many of the enemies with your knife as you can. There are occasional platforms that appear which can be climbed by ladders and mines can appear on the floor blocking your route. The mines can be removed by throwing a limited amount of grenades but more can be collected on the way. Once you reach the end of a level you have to kill a certain amount of soldiers to move to the next level.</p>",

You can walk left or right but to jump you have to hold the fire button down and the longer you hold it the higher and further you will jump. Careful use of this is needed as you can only land on the ground or the top of a platform, if you touch the sides of a platform, wall or touch an obstacle like water or spikes then you lose one of nine lives. As you get deeper into a cave you will encounter various creatures but you have a gun that fires in four directions and will send a creature back to it's original starting position when shot. If you touch a creature then you lose a life as well. Ropes can be used to climb and to get across gaps between platforms. Before you start a game you can select whether to start on the last level you were on or start from level one.</p>",

If a full line fills the playing area across then that line disappears but if a gap remains in the line as the shapes land on top then the line stays. As well as moving the stones left or right, the player can also make the stone land below instantly, and turn the stone round. Once the stones reach the top of the playing area then it is game over.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Battle</em> is a strategy war game set in the icy waters of the North Sea and has two oil drilling companies fighting over the last remaining deposits of oil. Played against another player or the computer, each player has to destroy the other players ships, aircrafts and oil rigs by moving their ships and aircraft around a top view single screen. Each player is equipped with four ships, two submarines, a helicopter and plane to defend four oil rigs and attempt to destroy the other players crafts.</p>\n<p>The game is split into two phases, Input Phase and Action Phase with each player taking it in turns to input their commands. Each player cycles through their various icons depicting their crafts and the player can move them around the screen, dive and surface (submarines), land and take-off (aircraft) and fire their various weapons. If a craft hits an oil rig then both are destroyed. Once both players have given their commands then the Action Phase consists of a small pause before the screen shows all the new positions.</p>",

After extensive testing with computer simulations, the ship is passing all the tests but to really know it's capabilities it has to be flown for real in a combat zone. You have been chosen to take the ship for a test flight by flying into the combat zone and trying to get it out in one piece.</p>\n<p><em>Danger Zone</em> is a side view shooter where you control the ship on the left of the screen, moving it up or down, while various spacecraft and small asteroids fly across the screen from right to left. You must blast or avoid the crafts but the asteroids cannot be destroyed and if you are hit by a craft or asteroid then you lose part of your shield and when it is gone then you lose one of three lives. As you use your lasers then your energy will drain and when this is empty you lose a life but when you don't fire then it will increase.</p>",

To clear each screen you must reach a love heart while collecting all the chocolate to move to the next screen. On each screen are various creatures with some firing bullets at you and you must kill them all with your bullets to progress. Touching any creature loses you one of five lives and clearing a screen gives you an extra one. As well as the normal platforms, there are moving platforms as well as poles that take you upwards.</p>",

Waking up, you realise that the planets occupants, Zobwats have stripped your spaceship clean and hidden the parts in an underground kingdom. Each piece is placed in the middle of various single screens with exits on the walls and you must kill a certain amount of Zobwats to get each piece. To kill the Zobwats you must drop a Time Bomb and it will explode after a couple of seconds so you need to make sure you are not in its blast range. After the bomb explodes it takes a few seconds for you to be able to use another one. If you are hit by the blast range or hit a Zobwat then you lose one of three lives. Once all Zobwats are destroyed then the piece appears on the right of the screen in a jigsaw grid and you move to an exit to find another piece of your ship using a map on the right side of the screen. At any time you can go to the jigsaw grid to rearrange the pieces in their correct place.</p>",

The keys and doors are numbered so the keys must be matched with the correct door to proceed. As you explore the depths of the castle you will encounter various creatures out to stop you and if you touch one then you lose one of three lives. To protect yourself, you are armed with a laser but the use of this is limited shown by an energy gauge at the bottom of the screen and extra energy for your laser can be found scattered around the maze. Before you start the game you can select the level of difficulty (1-4)</p>",

Looking for samples and using a jet-pac, G Man is having so much fun he forgot the timings of the Moonbus back to Earth. It has left his location and landed 4 Km away and will take-off again in seven minutes back to Earth. In this side view left to right constantly scrolling game, you control G Man as you try to fly and run on the surface of the moon back to the Moonbus. As well as the dangers on the surface like gaps to clear, there are also meteors flying in the sky from right to left. You must use your jet-pac to avoid the gaps and the meteors being aware of the momentum when moving and gravity pulling you downwards. You can speed up when flying but any use of the jet-pac uses fuel but there are fuel dumps which can be collected.</p>",

You are able to control the speed of your craft and you must either fly between the Pillars for bonus points or avoid them.

        "description": "<p>Inspired by the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8853/qbert/\">Q*Bert</a>, you take the role of <em>Pancho</em> who has to paint all the squares on various heights in a isometric view on a single screen. To paint a square, all Pancho has to do is land on a square but needs to avoid a Mad Mexican Muncher that moves around the screen and if he touches it then he loses one of three lives. Also moving around the screen is a wild jumping bean that changes the squares back to their original colour but this can be caught to remove it.</p>\n<p>Pancho starts a level on one of two magic carpets and these can be stood on to have a breather as the Muncher can't land on them. Pressing the fire button anywhere on the screen transports Pancho on to one but this can only be done four times. Once the level has been cleared then it's onto the next one but with more Munchers and the squares have to be landed on more than once to paint them.</p>",

Each level as well as the diamonds have a number of hazards which need to be avoided and they are boulders, bows, holes and radioactive waste. The main hazard are the boulders and when you walk underneath clearing the dirt they will fall if a gap appears and any stacked on top will fall downwards where there is no dirt and will kill you if they fall on you. Bows cannot be touched, holes move randomly and are fatal to the touch and radioactive waste spreads where there is no dirt and although not fatal can dissolve boulders causing others to fall. If you get hit by a boulder, touch a bow or a hole then you lose one of four lives.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Roller Kong</em> is a single screen platform game based on the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/574/donkey-kong/\">Donkey Kong</a> where you have to rescue a maiden at the top of the screen. Holding her hostage is a giant ape and you have to get from the bottom of the screen climbing ladders to rescue her before a spider moves from the right of the screen and gets her. To stop you the ape will throw barrels which move along the platforms and down the ladders as well as fireballs which move diagonally across the screen. If you touch a barrel or a fireball then you lose one of three lives but the barrels can be stopped when you collect an axe for a short time but you can't climb ladders. Flowers can also be collected along the way for extra points. Once you rescue the maiden then you move on to the next level which has elevators replacing ladders and now the ape throws monsters called Spinks but there is no spider.</p>",

Each level is high in the air and you must keep the ball on solid platforms while avoiding the obstacles, gaps and aliens and if you touch an alien or obstacle, or fall off the platforms then you lose one of six lives. Certain platforms give you bonuses, let you bounce further or teleport you to new parts of the level. At the end of a level you play a bonus stage where you have to land on as many question marks as you can.</p>\n<p><strong>Planet Search:</strong> You are lost in a distant Galaxy and the only way home is to fly over the surface of eight planets to finally reach your goal. In this side view scrolling shooter you must blast a certain amount of aliens on each planet that appears. Above the playing area is a scanner showing the positions of the aliens and you can fly either to the right or the left to find and blast them. Each destroyed alien leaves behind an egg and this must be collected before it hatches into another alien. If you touch an alien then you lose part of a shield, take too many hits and your scanner stops working before you lose one of three lives. Once you have completed a level you must fly through a side view tunnel to get to the next planet and if you touch the sides then you are sent back to the last planet.</p>",

Your mission, in this side view single screen game is to leave Columbia in your space suit and fly upwards to deliver the Uranium one by one. Starting at the bottom of the screen you collect a pack of Uranium and fly upwards to the top of the screen avoiding asteroids, debris and satellites. Once you reach the top of the screen, you place the Uranium in one of six bays before flying downwards to pick up another pack of Uranium. You keep repeating the process being careful not to place a pack into a bay already with a pack of Uranium. Once the delivery is made you then move to another screen to repeat the same delivery but harder. If you touch any object or place the Uranium in a full bay then you lose one of three lives and start all over again.</p>",

In the four corners of the maze are power-pills and if eaten allow you to chase and eat the ghosts for a limited time. One unique feature is the ability to enter the area the Ghosts re-spawn to eat them after a power-pill has been eaten.</p>",

The screen is split into two parts, a road and a river with a resting place inbetween and you have to cross these within 30 seconds or you lose one of three lives. The road has traffic driving across the screen in both directions and if you touch a vehicle then you lose a life. Once you cross the road, you then have to cross a river with logs moving across the screen in both directions and if you hit the water then you lose a life. At the top of the screen are four gaps which you have to place your frog in one of them before attempting to get another frog up the screen. If you miss a gap or place a frog in an occupied one then you lose a life.</p>",

Unfortunately you share the tunnels with Mutants who are out to kill you so you must fight back with a limited supply of dynamite. To kill a Mutant you place the dynamite on the platform and move to a safe distance and part of the platform will disappear. Any Mutants that fall in the gap will die and once all Mutants are killed then you move to the next screen. If you are trapped by gaps then you can place new platforms and if you touch any Mutants you lose one of five lives. Before the start of the game you can select your skill level (1-5) with one being the easiest.</p>",

When you hit the asteroid it breaks into smaller pieces which also need blasting and you have to destroy every piece before the screen, which is decreasing, closes. If you touch an asteroid then you lose one of six lives but you can thrust forwards to avoid them but cannot stop, just change direction. The further you progress, the more large asteroids start on the screen.</p>",

The town is made up of five screens and arrows pointing to the left and the right on the top of the screen flash to show which direction to move to the next Outlaw. Once you find an Outlaw you must face him in line and move your gun up or down to kill him before he kills you. Your gun has seven bullets in it and to get more bullets for your gun you receive one bullet for shooting an outlaw or you move to the far right screen and reload all seven by touching your horse. If you are shot by an Outlaw then you lose one of three lives but your gun is reloaded. After losing all three lives it is game over but your total money received stays for the next games.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>GWNN</em> is a top view horizontal shooter where you fly left to right, or right to left over an alien base to complete six missions to finally destroy the base. Each mission has you attempting to complete a task which are, rescue scientists, destroy a generator, pick up autofire, destroy an ammo dump, fuel up and destroy the actual base. The items that need collecting are represented by letters and just need flying over to collect. As you fly you will encounter aliens moving across the screen as well as raised obstacles and touching any of these decrease a energy gauge. If this empties then you lose one of three lives but collecting the letter E increases it. If you complete a mission then you move to a bonus stage which sees you collecting bonus points.</p>",

Problem now is to remove the chests while avoiding the various guardians who will stop anyone attempting to remove the treasure. The game is a single screen maze game where you have to get a chest on each screen to an exit portal but the chests can only be pushed so a route needs to be planned. Doc though is able to move off the screen and appear on the other side of the screen. As you push the chest, there are various Guardians moving around the screen as well as obstacles like snakes, and if they are touched then a energy bar decreases and if it empties then a life is lost. Gold bars and diamonds can be collected for bonus points and certain items can be collected to increase your energy.</p>\n<p>Before the start of the game there are various options that can be adjusted and they are, Number of Lives (1-9), Speed of the Game (1-10), Maze Number (1-20), Number of Ghosts (0-7), Strength of Ghosts (0-9), and Power of Ignots (0-99). Two players can play and each player takes it in turns to play when the other player has died.</p>",

The road has traffic moving across the screen from right to left, and left to right and the river has logs and turtles moving in the same directions. You have 30 seconds to get your frog on a lily pad or you lose one of three lives by avoiding the traffic or riding on the logs and turtles.

To do this, you have to collect spinners and bombs, then drop them on to the wall while avoiding falling bricks which settle on the wall and makes the wall higher. The spinners can remove the bricks but cannot remove the bottom row but the bombs can remove the bottom row of bricks. You are armed with a laser to shoot the falling bricks but if you touch one then you lose one of seven lives. You can also move on to the next level if you survive a level when a clock reaches zero.</p>",

Starting on the left of the screen you must reach a chosen house in an fenced off estate on the right of the screen. You first must move around trees before attempting to cross two railway tracks with speeding trains moving up and down the screen. Once past the railway lines, you have to cross two rivers by jumping on moving boats to get to the other side. You are now outside the estate with one entrance and inside is the house (coloured purple) but there are vehicles driving around the streets. </p>\n<p>Once the mail is delivered, you have to get back to the left of the screen to pick up more mail and another 28 days to deliver it. If you touch a vehicle, fall in the river or run out of days then you lose one of three lives but there are Bumper Boosters in the estate to give you a few seconds of invunerability.</p>",

The outpost consists of a barrier containing two gun emplacements on either side that are controlled together and fire outwards to blast any enemy that appear. The game is a single screen shooter where you move the guns in the centre of the screen, up or down to blast aliens that appear from either side of the screen over various levels. </p>\n<p>As you blast the aliens that move around the screen, others will appear and head straight to the barrier, and when hit loses energy, and when your energy is gone then you lose one of five lives. Your guns are also able to jump forward for a brief time to clear any aliens that move up or down the barrier. To clear a level you have to destroy all the aliens on screen but occasionally an object appears on the side of the screen and if shot moves you to the next level.</p>",

You play the role of a builder who must move around a building site, climbing ladders, looking for sums to make a target number. You are given a starting number and you must pick up sums to add or subtract from that number to make the target number. Each level is split into three different target numbers and each must be completed before a bucket is lifted to the top of the screen. Once a level is completed you get paid money before attempting the next level.</p>\n<p>Before you play the game you can select your starting level as well as your builder who vary in different speeds. There is also a Self Test where you choose a level of difficulty and attempt to give the correct answers to ten sums before receiving a score.</p>",

The game is split into three sections which are Downhill, Target Jump and Slalom, and all three section must be completed in one go before a timer runs out. Downhill has you skiing down the mountain, moving left or right, avoiding obstacles like trees on the side of the screen, rocks, bumps and logs and when touched causes you to crash and lose valuable seconds. You can accelerate your skier and ice patches allow you to go faster, but hitting ski's slows you down. Target Jump has you waggling left and right to pick up speed before jumping of a ramp. You move your skier up or down to land as close to the centre of a target. To finish the game you now attempt Slalom where you must go through gates made up of flags.</p>",

You have been sent by NATO to fly over the surface of the moon to destroy the Units in your spacecraft so that a special force can come and destroy the weapon. The game is a side view horizontal shooter where the screen scrolls right or left when you move. In each location are three units and you have to keep blasting them but as you blast, repair crews will repair where you have shot and each unit has a gauge at the top of the screen which decreases when you blast them. Protecting the units are low flying satellites and other objects and if you touch any satellites, objects or the units then you lose one of three lives. As you fly around and shoot, two gauges, fuel and ammo decrease but more can be collected if you land on a supply dump.</p>",

The only solution is to call in <em>Pizza Pete</em> to break into the bakery and make the pizza himself. The game is a single screen platformer inspired by the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/467/burgertime/\">BurgerTime</a> where you have to run along platforms and climb ladders to make the pizza. Each screen is made up of four rows of platforms and on each level is an ingredient, the base, cheese, tomato and salami. Controlling Pete you run over the ingredients which pushes them down to the next row and pushes any other ingredients below, downwards. </p>\n<p>As you make the pizza there are various items moving around the screen like sausages, spoons, bottles and onions, and if you touch one then you lose one of five lives. Pete is able to make his hat bigger and this makes him immune for a short period shown by a clock on the bottom of the screen. Pete only has four hats but can get more when his assistant, Sophia runs across the screen and is touched. Sometimes Sophia won't give you a hat and you can't get another one if your hat is big.</p>",

Once you reach the mansion the view switches to a high elevated angle and the screen scrolls left or right when you move as you search for the safe. As you search you will encounter security guards (once again, bouncing balls) and these need avoiding because if you touch one as well as any police, you lose one of three lives. When you reach the safe, you have to touch it before leaving the room it is in for it to explode. You collect what's in the safe before making your way back to the start of the mansion.

You have managed to escape and have decided to take back the planet by entering the city of Daikon, via underground caverns and destroy nuclear pods and weapons. <em>Raider</em> is a side view horizontal shooter where the screen scrolls constantly from left to right. You move you spacecraft up or down and you have a cannon and bombs to help you in your mission. You must avoid the sides of the caverns as well as any pods or weapons you encounter, and if you touch any then you lose one of three lives. As you fly, your fuel gauge decreases but shooting or bombing pods increases it.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1087/arkanoid/\">Arkanoid</a>, <em>Reflex</em> is a single screen game where you have to remove bricks on various screens by bouncing a ball with two paddles. As well as the difference of playing with two paddles that move in the opposite direction, you play horizontally instead of vertically. With bricks that take one hit to remove, there are bricks that require multiple hits, bricks that can't be removed, speed bricks which speed up the ball, stun ray bricks which fires a laser every five seconds, and blocker bricks which can block the path of the bat. </p>\n<p>Certain bricks when removed also leave behind a star and when hit which gives you a bonus or items to help like extra points, a wall behind the bat, magnetic bat, 3 missiles or an extra life. If the ball goes past either bat then you lose one of three lives. There is also a time limit on each screen and you lose a life if a timer gauge empties.</p>",

As well as platforms to get around, doors must be used to get to other parts of the castle. There are various obstacles that need avoiding like water, drills and platforms that move left and right and if you touch any of the obstacles then you lose one of three lives.

As a farewell gift, his Father gave him a magic carpet to ride the land, but also gave a warning about an evil genie in one of the castles. Realising that great power would come his way if the genie was defeated, the young man decided to explore the land to get treasures but also to get experience and magic to face the genie in one final showdown. </p>\n<p><em>Rug Rider</em> is a side view single screen game where you must fly around the screen on your magic carpet to collect keys to unlock the treasure over various locations. Before you play a screen, you are presented with a map that has various locations and you are able to select any one to play. As you fly around each screen, there are various creatures that fly around and these must be avoided or shot with limited amounts of magic. If you touch a creature then you lose one of five lives but you keep any keys collected. Hitting platforms or objects too hard also loses you a life. Up to four players can play but each player has to wait for the other players to play a full game before having a turn.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the aracde game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a>, <em>Shoot-It</em> is a side view single screen shooter where you control a craft at the bottom of the screen, moving left or right, to blast aliens above. The aliens are in formation and move across the screen from left to right, and when they reach the end of the screen, they then move left but one place lower. As you blast the aliens, they drop bombs which need avoiding and if you are hit then you lose one of three lives. To help protect you, there are four shields between you and the aliens but these can be shot and removed piece by piece from the aliens bombs and your shots. If you allow the aliens to land on the surface then you lose a life also. There are five skill levels (1-5) to choose from with one being the slowest.</p>",

The token moves through the pipe and part of the next level appears in the other half of the screen. There are two types of creatures that move around the screen with one fatal to touch and you lose one of eight lives when touched, and one that takes the token you are holding and places it elsewhere on the screen.

You look through your periscope and when any ship comes into view you fire your torpedoes but once the torpedoes have been fired you can't fire anymore until they hit or miss the ships. As you attempt to destroy ships, an anti-aircraft alert will occasionally start flashing meaning a plane will soon fly across the screen. You must dive under the water and wait until you think it safe to re-surface. If you see the plane then that means the plane has spotted you and it is game over.

        "description": "<p>Your base is due to be attacked by several convoys of ships so you have been tasked to command a submarine and look for the convoys and destroy them. Starting from your base on a single screen map, you must sail around the surrounding waters looking for convoys either on the surface of the water or underneath. You are able to steer your sub as well as control the speed listening to your echo sounder. For a look at your location you can use your periscope to visually check but you can only be so deep under water before you lose the periscope if in use. </p>\n<p>You only have a limited supply of fuel and torpedoes but a return back to base replenishes these. Sailing underwater decreases your oxygen levels but surfacing increases it as running out of oxygen means game over. Leaving or entering your base requires moving through an area full of mines and this is viewed from the side with the screen scrolling left to right. You must move up or down to avoid the mines or it is game over. Once you encounter a convoy, you can use your periscope to help you aim and fire your torpedoes. The ships will fire back and also planes escorting the ships will try to destroy you so diving allows you to avoid being hit but you get less points for hitting ships. If you hit a ships ammo store then it is an instant sinking but anywhere else only damages the ship.</p>",

The labyrinth is made up of various levels, each one viewed from the side with the screen scrolling in multiple directions when you move, and you must collect all the jewels to move to the next level before a strict time limit reaches zero. As you run around the pipes you use up energy shown by a gauge, and if you touch any creature then this decreases it even further. You are armed with a gun to shoot the creatures but the ammo is limited but extra ammo and energy can be found. Gates can block your path but keys are scattered around each level to collect and open the gates, with lifts to help you get to higher parts of the labyrinth.

        "description": "<p><em>UXB</em> is a single screen game where you play the role of Captain Dar-es UXB, a bomb disposal expert who has been called to save the Caverns of Time. Gaterns have placed bombs in each cavern because they weren't given immortality by Lord of the Touchstone and vow to destroy them all. You must move around the screen, touching four of the bombs to defuse them before each bomb's timers run out, then you touch a Hour Gate to move to the next cavern. If you defuse more than four bombs then the Hour Gate's won't open and you have to sacrifice a life to move to the next cavern.</p>\n<p>The screens are made up of touchstones and when you move from a touchstone, it disappears so a path needs to be planned so you are not trapped with no where to move. You can though, hold down the fire button to move a row of touchstones left or right, but anything touching the edge of the screen disappears. As you move and defuse bombs, there are also Qerims moving around and if touched then you lose a life. Time Spines are represented by Skull and Crossbones and also need avoiding but cherries collected give bonus points. You have five lives to start with but if you allow any bomb to explode then it is instant game over.</p>",

You are the commander of a destroyer and your job is to keep dropping bombs to destroy the subs.

The subs move across the screen, left or right at various depths below and fire torpedoes upwards and these must be avoided or you lose one of seven lives. As you move and bomb, your fuel decreases and if it reaches zero then you lose a life, but a helicopter flies across the screen dropping barrels to increase your fuel.

As you drive you must watch your rev counter and change up a gear at the right time for maximum acceleration. Each computer controlled car increases in difficulty.</p>\n<p><strong>3D Maze:</strong> A maze game inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/138/pac-man/\">Pac-Man</a> but instead of viewing the maze from above, you view it from a 1st person perspective. The aim of the game is to eat all the dots in the maze while avoiding ghosts and if you are caught then you lose one of six lives. In the four corners of the maze are four power-pills and when eaten allow you to eat the ghosts for a short time. Next to the main playing area is a map of the whole maze to help you find your way. There are various mazes and each increase in difficulty and you start with one ghost which increases the further you progress.</p>",

The aliens move around the outside of the screen in various formations and these need blasting for as long as possible. Occasionally an alien will break off from it's formation and attempt to hit your guns and if a gun is hit then it is the loss of one of three lives.

The game is a side view horizontal scrolling shooter where the screen scrolls left or right constantly when you move, but you are able to scroll the screen up or down. You must shoot all the satellites while avoiding various objects that are either static or move around the screen and if you hit one then you lose one of five lives. As you fly and shoot, a fuel gauge decreases and when it reaches the red part then you must re-fuel by docking with your Mothership which appears when you are low on fuel.</p>\n<p><strong>Invaders:</strong> A side view single screen shooter based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a> where you control a craft at the bottom of the screen, moving left or right, to blast aliens in formation above who are dropping bombs. The aliens move across the screen to the right and when they hit the side of the screen then they drop down one place and move to the left. Between you and the aliens are four shields which protect you from the bombs but will start to disappear from the bombs and your shots. If you are hit by a bomb or allow the aliens to land then you lose one of three lives. A Mothership occasionally moves across the top of the screen and if shot gives you bonus points. There are 9 skill levels (1-9) with one being the easiest.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Sandcastles and Paramaths</em> is a double educational games pack aimed at children between 5 - 11 years old with the following two games to improve their maths skills for two players:</p>\n<p><strong>Sandcastles:</strong> The aim is to answer questions on either addition or multiplication to build a sandcastle before the other player. There are nine difficulty levels to choose from (1-9) with one being the easiest, and as one player receives a question to answer, the other player's sandcastle is being built. Once the player gets the question right then the other player's sandcastle stops being built and now has to answer a question while the other sandcastle gets bigger.</p>\n<p><strong>Paramaths:</strong> A plane is flying over the sea and gets shot down, causing a maths question to parachute out of the plane and float towards the sea. A player has to answer the question before it hits the water and when answered correctly the other player has to watch his plane being shot before answering the question that appears. The are two difficulty levels (easy or hard).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mindbenders</em> is a collection of eight games to get the brain-cells working with puzzle, strategy and action games:</p>\n<p><strong>Repeat After Me:</strong> A memory game where you have to match the sequence the computer shows you by pressing buttons. You start with just one button pressed and if correct the computer then presses the same button and then another one. Every time you get the sequence correct the computer adds another button until you get the sequence wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeff's Panel:</strong> You are presented with an 8 x 8 grid full of four different coloured squares in a formation. You let the computer know how many times to scramble the formation before you then have to put the squares back in their correct order. You are only allowed to slide a whole row or column to move any square.</p>\n<p><strong>Rotation:</strong> You are presented with a 4 x 4 grid with each square having a letter inside. You must move the letters around to put the them in order. When you select a letter to move it will rotate with four other letters in a clockwise direction. You cannot select a letter on the edge of the grid and you have one special move where you can swap two letters</p>\n<p><strong>Blackjack:</strong> A casino card game where you have to beat the dealer to win money by getting 21 or as close to without going over. You have two cards and you must decide whether to keep them or to receive another card. Once you are happy with your total or you go over 21 (Bust) the dealer plays. Two players can play the computer and both start with $1000 and you have the choice of how many decks to play with (1-6).</p>\n<p><strong>Labyrinth:</strong> A 1st person perspective game where you have to get to an exit in a 3D maze. You first can select the size of the maze before seeing a map of the maze. As you wander the maze, you can select the map but the aim is to escape without using the map.</p>\n<p><strong>Letter Slider:</strong> You are presented with a 3 x 3 grid full of squares with letters inside and one blank square. You must move the letters around the grid to put them in order using the blank square to put a letter in.</p>\n<p><strong>Magic Square:</strong> You are presented with a 3 x 3 grid with squares with a number inside and you have to highlight all the squares leaving square 5 in the middle blank. Pressing a number highlights certain squares and you keep pressing numbers to highlight the squares.</p>\n<p><strong>Word Search:</strong> You input up to 20 words before trying to find the words in a 20 x 20 grid full of letters. The words can be horizontal, vertical, diagonal and backwards.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>HJD Games</em> is a collection of eight games that contains the following:</p>\n<p><strong>Invasion:</strong>  A single screen side view shooter inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a> where you control a spacecraft, moving left or right, at the bottom of the screen, blasting aliens in formation above. The aliens move from left to right and when they reach the right side of the screen, they move left but one place lower. As you blast the aliens they drop bombs and if you are hit by a bomb or allow them to land then you lose one of four lives. Between you and the aliens are six shields to protect you from the bombs but these start to disappear when hit from you and the aliens. Occasionally a Mothership flies from left to right across the top of the screen and when shot gives you bonus points.</p>\n<p><strong>Firelab:</strong> A top view single screen maze game where you must move around the maze blasting and avoiding the aliens that move around the maze. If you touch an alien then you lose one of three lives and when all aliens are gone, you move to the next level.</p>\n<p><strong>Xelien:</strong> A side view single screen shooter where you control a spacecraft at the bottom of the screen, moving left or right, blasting aliens that move around the screen. Below your craft are seven humans and you must stop certain aliens from picking up the humans and taking them away. If you are shot, touched by an alien, or lose all the humans then you lose one of three lives. Destroy all the aliens on screen and you move to the next level.</p>\n<p><strong>Zonex:</strong> A single screen shooter where you control two spacecrafts, one on the bottom of the screen and one on the right side of the screen and you can only move one craft at a time. You must blast all the aliens on the screen and if you are shot or touch an alien then you lose one of four lives. Destroy all the aliens on the screen and you move to the next level.</p>\n<p><strong>Droid:</strong> A single screen top view shooter where you must destroy all the droids on the screen to move to the next level. Control of your spacecraft has you turning in a 360 degree angle, left or right, and you press up to move forward. If you are hit by a droid then you lose one of four lives.</p>\n<p><strong>Jailbreak:</strong> A single screen side view shooter where you control a spacecraft at the bottom of the screen, moving left or right, and you must stop six balls from escaping. In the middle of the screen is a rectangle with six balls walled in and aliens move from the sides of the screen to destroy the wall. When an alien hits the wall, it removes part of it and then the alien moves back across the screen. Once a gap appears in the wall, the balls can escape and bounce around the screen. The aliens helping in the escape drop bombs while you blast them and if you are hit by an alien or ball then you lose one of three lives. As in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a> there are shields between you and the aliens to protect you from their bombs but the shields start to disappear when hit from you or the aliens.</p>\n<p><strong>Maniac:</strong> A single screen top view shooter inspired by the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/141/centipede/\">Centipede</a> where you control a spacecraft on the bottom of the screen, moving left or right, trying to destroy a centipede type creature that moves across the screen moving downwards. As you blast the centipede, it will break into two every time you hit it and the centipede will also change direction when it hits one of many mushrooms on the screen. The mushrooms can be shot for points and various creatures appear on screen and need shooting as well. If you are hit by any creature then you lose one of three lives.</p>\n<p><strong>Ghost-Hunt:</strong> A side view single screen shooter where you have to destroy all the ghosts on the screen by shooting a ball which you can only shoot one at a time. When you move, you dig through dirt and make a path and the ghosts need releasing from a huge hole before you can destroy them all. If you are hit by a ghost then it is game over.</p>",

Other than that the gameplay is almost identical to the original game. As the bricks fall from the top of the screen the player can move them left or right and rotate them. For each line cleared the player earns points and the game goes on until the bricks reaches the top of the screen. The aim is simply to get the highest score possible and reach a high position in the high score chart. Before starting out it's possible to choose the speed of the game (0-9) but unlike the original Tetris the speed is constant and doesn't increase as the game goes on.</p>",

The main goal requires removing all the blocks from the board within limited numbers of moves. By clicking on a single spot, the player affects all the fields around by their reversal, including the chosen one - filled block disappears and a blank spot is replaced with filled block. Basically, each taken action reverses simultaneously 9 fields, one in the middle, and 8 around (3x3 square).</p>",

You discover it as soon as you start playing: all the blocks, unfriendly creatures, and keys, that are in the same row as you, are pushed or pulled into the direction you are moving, regardless how far away they are. There is a strict time limit that expands a little when you collect a key. You also have the ability to materialize or dissolve a limited amount of yellow boxes. Further annoyance is, yellow objects cannot be pushed off the side of the screen (so they would roll over to the other side), instead, they push you back. Get ready to be infuriated!</p>",

There are 6 worlds with different themes, all split into 2 levels. A certain amount of hearts has to be sought out and collected in order to complete the levels. </p>\n<p>If you reach the exit at the end of a level without the required amount of hearts, you have to restart it from the beginning! These hearts also serve as extra lives. You also have a health bar. Balls can be collected to throw at unfriendly creatures. Checkpoints are in the middle of the levels.</p>\n<p>For a bonus, there is a second part added to the game more recently - 3 huge free-roaming levels with multi-directional scrolling. The two parts are separate and are selectable from a menu.</p>\n<p>The game itself is freeware, but physical disk with artwork and packaging can be ordered from Psytronik.</p>",

The most important utility at your disposal is the very small radar screen at the top of the screen. Most of the time you spend looking at the radar to see when cars are about to hit you, so you can slow down and avoid them.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Commando</em> for Commodore 16 is a very loose adaptation of Capcom's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1618/commando/\">arcade game</a>. It consists of five non-scrolling screens of action based on locales from the original game: there are enemies in fox holes in areas one, two and three, bridges to cross in areas two and three, enemies on an open field in area four, and an enemy fortress in area five. There are two kinds of enemies, either sporting guns or rocket launchers, though they only fire either straightly or diagonally downward. All enemies in an area must be destroyed to get to the next. Once all five are cleared, the game restarts from the beginning. Unlike in the original arcade game, the player's soldier can only shoot and not throw grenades.</p>",
