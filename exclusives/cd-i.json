        "description": "<p>This is the third game in the row of Philips' titles set in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Zelda\">Zelda</a> universe. In this game, you play the princess Zelda herself. The evil Gannon has captured and imprisoned the brave hero Link. In order to save him, Zelda has to venture into Tolemac, an uncharted southeastern region of the land of Hyrule, and to collect seven celestial signs, which is the only way to defeat Gannon.</p>\n<p>Unlike the two previous Zelda games for CD-i (which were platformers), <em>Zelda's Adventure</em> returns to the traditional top-down view of the series. You navigate Zelda over the world map, visiting towns, talking to townspeople for clues, and descending into dangerous dungeons. You can equip swords, shields, and various kinds of gear. The combat is entirely action-based.</p>",

In the game you control princess Zelda. Her father, the king, went to the land of Gamelon to help Duke Onkled in his battle against the evil Ganon. A month has passed, but there is no news from the king. The brave hero Link decides to find him but then disappears. The young princess travels to Gamelon by herself to find and to free both her father and Link...</p>\n<p>Unlike classic Zelda games, <em>Wand of Gamelon</em> is viewed from a side-scrolling perspective. In the beginning you are given a map with several accessible locations. Once you choose a location, you enter a side-view level, where you must fight enemies in real-time combat, as well as meet people who will send you on quests. At any time there are several locations accessible, and many quests can be completed in a non-linear fashion.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This is a puzzle game based on the Nintendo character Mario. The Princess has invited Mario and Luigi to a picnic in the Mushroom Kingdom. But when the Mario Brothers arrive, they learn that King Bowser Koopa is making over the kingdom into his personal resort and the princess has been kidnapped, again. </p>\n<p>Mario and Luigi must stop him and rescue the princess by closing doors in the hotels.</p>\n<p>Most hotel stages have 10 levels, other stages have less, others more. You close doors by pressing button 2. Enemies will come through some doors and will try to open doors to prevent you from succeeding. You can jump on some enemies by pressing button 1.</p>\n<p>Behind some doors, you will find a mushroom that will allow you to take a hit without dying. If you already got a mushroom, you will find a fire flower that will allow you to shoot fireballs by pressing buttons 1 &amp; 2 simultaneously. This will take out some enemies easier and other enemies can only be defeated with the fireball.</p>\n<p>When you reach the top level of your current hotel, you will need to close the doors here while avoiding one of the Koopalings. Once you succeed, there will be an animated FMV cutscene then it is off to the next hotel (stage).</p>\n<p>All the stages are plays on real hotels, like Morton's WoodDoor-Hysteria Hotel, Roy's HardBrick Hotel, Lemmy's High-ate Regency Hotel, Bowser's Seizures Palace Hotel, etc.</p>",

As Marvin, a wizard's apprentice, your master Mr. Wandburner gives you a series of tasks to complete (basically fetching an object found at the end of a level), spread out on six levels with three stages each, taking place on land, in the sea and in the air. In order to make your life in the aquatic levels easier, the wizard will turn you into a frog. In order to fly, you're equipped with a special flying helmet. Each level has a new weapon for you to use, ranging from the traditional magic wand to a rubber ball, a water pistol or even a laser gun. As in any normal platform game, each level has an end-boss, and between levels are bonus rounds.</p>",

There are three storylines with four difficulty levels, each with a unique solution making it altogether twelve different mysteries: The Hodded Madonna, Happy Ever After and Deadly Patent.</p>\n<p>The movement system, where the player moves the cursor to a portion of the screen and clicks on it to move or turn to that direction is similar to the one found in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/283/the-7th-guest/\">The 7th Guest</a>. Inside the rooms the screen switches to a 360\u00ba panorama that can be scrolled by moving the cursor to its edges. Clicking on clocks starts a flashback video of what happened on the room before the crime was committed. Clicking on suspects brings up the interrogation screen, where they can be inquired about weapons, their alibis, etc. Clicking on secret passages transports the player to another room. Clicking on the bell calls the butler and the accusation menu, where the player chooses the weapon and the murderer. Afterwards, the butler informs if the player made the right choice. A notebook keeps track of all the information collected, and can be accessed at any time.</p>\n<p>Each of the four difficulty levels have a different number of accusations available (3 on the easiest level, 1 on the hardest one). In the easier levels the room positions are fixed, while in the tougher levels they are random.</p>\n<p>In each player's turn they can perform two moves, two actions or a action and a move. A move is defined by entering and leaving a room. A action is defined by examining items, interrogating suspects or watching a flashback.</p>",

Each player takes turns being in the \"hot seat.\" The game displays a narrated slideshow of an amusing but awkward situation, then asks how the player would respond. He enters his response secretly, and another player (the \"challenger\") tries to predict what it was. Situations are drawn from the categories Love, Career, Money, and Family. Correct guesses earn points, but there's an element of bluffing, too. The game is aimed at adults and teenagers.</p>",

If the player has chosen correctly they will hit it successfully and be treated to a cutscene where the ball will avoid the various obstacles and landing in the hole. Choosing the wrong path, however, will have their ball destroyed by a variety of obstacles and force the player to retry again.</p>\n<p>A feature of the game is the voice acting talent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/258999/eugene-levy/\">Eugene Levy</a> who is most notable for his film appearances in the <em>American Pie</em> film series.</p>",

Clicking on elements may or may not instigate an event which could be either positive or negative. Behind the Lost Boys walks a sheep that keeps the score which goes up or down whenever you do something. Levels are broken up by sketches from the show. With enough points it is also possible to buy new sketches. There are several mini games to be found in the game such as memory, \"guess who said it\" and \"guess the sketch\" in which additional points can be scored.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Laser Lords</em> is a comedic adventure game that takes place in space.</p>\n<p>In the game the player takes on the role of a human hitchhiker who is abducted from a desert road by a space ship. The plot will unfold to have the player save the universe. An evil and ancient being called Sarpedon is trying to obtain a certain crystal that will allow him to possess the entire universe. Needless to say the player has to prevent this from happening. The game requires you to explore seven planets, each of which has settings that resemble our own mythology and history such as the planet Argos that looks much like ancient Greece. Each world is full of references to historic events and stories.</p>\n<p>The game combines adventure game elements with platform game elements. The player has 9 lives. When you run out the game is over, but you can save and load the game to prevent from having to start the game over completely. You can collect and trade items to solve puzzles. When talking to NPCs highlighted words in their dialogue can be remembered. This places them in your \"word bank\" and allows you to ask other NPCs about those subjects. All the NPCs are fully voiced. Actors often impersonated famous voices like those of Arnold Schwarzenegger, John Wayne and Gregory Peck.</p>\n<p>In spite of its \"Ages 12 and up\" rating, the game is filled with dark humor, sex, drugs, homosexuality and gambling references. It is even possible to play Russian Roulette in the game.</p>",

The letters can be used to either form a long word or multiple short words. Points are scored for each correct word. Letters are received one at a time and disappear again after a certain amount of time creating a time pressure for forming words.

        "description": "<p><em>The Lost Ride</em> is a rail shooter game where you are literally on rails. The player is put inside a futuristic roller coaster and has to shoot anything that might get in his way. The game comes with three different themes for its levels: Mine World, Aqua World and Future World. Each world has different seamless prerendered 3D backgrounds that feature as backdrops for the shooting action. At the end of each stage a Boss creature has to be killed, which will unlock a bonus ride. These random generated tracks are maze-like and require you to choose a direction at various points. They are presented in surround sound so they really feel like being inside a roller coaster.</p>",

In the second phase he has to construct the plant and in the final phase he goes into production and has to make a profit. If the player doesn't do very well he can be fired at any time, which means it's game over. There are three different difficulty levels.</p>\n<p>At the end of the ten years the player is awarded with a score. The score depends on three criteria: Profit, PR skills and environmental issues.

When Tsu Yu's father, a powerful warlord, is murdered and his sword stolen, Tsu Yu vows to avenge his father's murder. The player (as Tsu Yu) will have to learn Shaolin Kung Fu to do so. </p>\n<p>The player has to roam the land and speak with other Kung Fu heroes, who will most likely only scoff at the player. Occasionally they will send the player on a trial which comes in the form of a mini game, such as shooting a snake with a bow and arrow, engaging in Kung Fu fighting and karate, throwing stars, performing calligraphy and playing memory to learn Chinese symbols. </p>\n<p>Completing challenges changes the color of the player's belt and gives him more recognition with the other fighters allowing him to progress further. It also unlocks new pieces of the map you can use to travel to new areas.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Zenith</em> is a game which defies traditional genre descriptions. Players control a silver ball, akin to a pinball, with a viewpoint looking directly down on the ball from above. Unlike pinball, where the ball falls vertically in front of the player, in <em>Zenith</em> continuously bounces towards and away from the player viewpoint. Imagine dropping a golf ball on a hard floor while looking at it directly from above - and then watching as the ball bounces directly upwards along that straight line of sight.</p>\n<p>There are no flippers or any other traditional elements similar to pinball. Instead the player controls the ball directly. While the bouncing cannot be controlled, the ball can be moved in any of the four cardinal directions. To progress players need to time the bounces on hard surfaces then push in the required direction to pass over bottomless pits and acid/lava pools. Time your movement poorly and the ball will miss connecting with a solid surface and plunge into death, losing the player a life.</p>\n<p>The screen cannot be scrolled horizontally, only vertically. As a result, the levels are like long vertical fields, and some levels are made up of multiple fields which are not directly connected. Later levels also feature warp gates which take you to different parts of that level, or to entirely different vertical fields. Power-ups and score increase items can be collected in the levels.</p>\n<p>Zenith plays similarly to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Bounder\">Bounder</a> and its sequel <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/37230/re-bounder/\">Re-bounder</a> on 8-bit home computers, albeit with a great sense of depth and speed, and the ability to scroll the screen in reverse.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This short game was exhibited at the International Garden and Greenery Exposition (Expo '90) held in Osaka, Japan, in 1990. It provides a brief engaging multimedia experience on the theme of botany.</p>\n<p>In the distant future, the planet Third has been rendered uninhabitable by an enormous meteor shower that ruined the atmosphere and rendered the air unbreathable. The space ship Beagle, named after the ship which carried Darwin on his famous naturalist exhibition, is exploring the galaxy to catalogue unique species. They discover a flower that, if brought back to Third, could remove the excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and render it livable again. On their way back, however, ship captains Takeru and Ursula become trapped in a meteor shower that threatens to destroy their precious cargo - and them along with it. Players must defend them in a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9177/missile-command/\">Missile Command</a>-style minigame by shooting down every meteor before it reaches them.</p>\n<p>Players have the option of either watching the 3-minute opening cutscene, and then playing the minigame, or skipping straight to the minigame. Players can select one of three different difficulty levels, which affects meteor patterns and movement speed. In the minigame, the Beagle is in the centre of a radar and meteors approach from all sides. Players control a crosshair using a trackball controller, and clicking button 1 fires a bomb which takes out any nearby meteors. The Beagle has two shields, so it's able to survive up to two hits without being destroyed. A round lasts 50 seconds, at the end of which the player is given a message depending on how many shields they had remaining.</p>",
