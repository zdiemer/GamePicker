        "description": "<p>Just like the arcade version, pick one of three tracks (beginner, advanced, or expert) and either automatic or standard transmission. A pounding music soundtrack kicks in as you are slapped into your car to await the green light. The game offers both a traditional arcade mode with checkpoint time splits and a special PC mode that pits you against the other cars over different race distances. The PC mode also offers more car choices, with a variety of speed, acceleration, and grip characteristics. It even rewards successful players (meaning those finishing first, second, or third in the difficult setting) by offering up to ten more upgraded cars to drive. Once underway, the goal is to work from last to first as smoothly and quickly as possible</p>",

        "description": "<p>On a November day when the snow turned to rain, Ryu Hazuki arrives home just in time to see his father killed by Lan Di, a man Ryu's father obviously knew very well. Ryu attempts to stop Lan Di but is effortlessly beaten to within an inch of his life. After recovering from his injuries Ryu sets out to track down his father's murderer, as well as uncover his family's secrets and the mystery of the Phoenix and Dragon mirrors that Lan Di seeks.</p>\n<p><em>Shenmue</em> is a hybrid game that incorporates elements of life simulation, adventure, and fighting with light role-playing. The game is set in a 3D environment that can be freely explored by the player. Much of the gameplay involves talking to Ryu's friends and the various people around town, hoping to find hints or clues that lead to the next step in the story. Any details Ryu learns are written down in his notebook for future review. Ryu can buy items from stores or try his luck with capsule toy machines, but most items that can be bought have no purpose outside of filling his inventory. Ryu can also visit an arcade and play accurate versions of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=%E3%83%8F%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%82%AA%E3%83%B3\">Hang-On</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1434/space-harrier/\">Space Harrier</a>, as well as games like darts and pool.</p>\n<p>Ryu is a trained martial artist, and while a true martial artist knows it is better to avoid a fight, sometimes it is still necessary. Ryu can train his moves, either by repeatedly doing them while training or by sparring with his friend Fuku-san, which constitutes the role-playing element of the game. The fighting system is similar to that of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/351/virtua-fighter-series/\">Virtua Fighter series</a>, although with toned-down air juggling. Ryu's training also gives him heightened reflexes, and sometimes during a cutscene the player will have only a moment to press a button (displayed onscreen) to get Ryu out of danger. Failing an input prompt is not always fatal, but whether Ryu survives or not depends on the danger he was in.</p>\n<p>Included with the game is the <em>Shenmue Passport</em> disc. On this disc, players can receive tutorials about various aspects of the game like mini-games or the battle system, watch cutscenes they've already seen in the game, and listen to music from the game. This disc also includes the option to go online to a special site where players can review worldwide mini-game rankings, get hints for the game from Nozomi, review game maps of Yokosuka, trade uncommon items found in the game for even rarer items only available on the passport, and visit the official homepage. This service went offline along with the rest of SegaNet, and all online features are currently impossible to access.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the year 2000, a massive earthquake hits the Yucatan Peninsula region of Mexico, sending shockwaves throughout the area. A large, unknown island emerges from the depths of the ocean bordering this land with what appears to be a giant crater located near its center. American and Mexican government officials cordon off this new landmass and dispatch an investigative task force to the island. It is determined that the crater was created by the impact of the giant meteor that crashed into the Yucatan 65 million years before, wreaking havoc upon the Earth's ecosystem and bringing about a nuclear winter so devastating that it pushed the dinosaurs, the dominant land-dwelling lifeforms of the time, to complete extinction. Thus the island is named Dinosaur Island. Highly classified research of the island, the crater and what lies within it goes on for 17 years while a city is built to house and accommodate the researchers and workers. This research and the island's economy are dominated entirely by a large biotech corporation known as Kimra.</p>\n<p>Eliot Ballade, an elite member of Kimra's Dinosaur Island ESER (Emergency Sea Evacuation and Rescue), is enjoying a day off aboard his friend's boat a short distance from the coast when suddenly a small meteor falls from the sky and descends toward Dinosaur Island. At the moment of impact, a mysterious dome of energy appears from the center of the island, expanding outwards at an astonishing speed towards Eliot's position. Just as the dome of energy approaches, a flock of hideous birds ram straight into the boat, causing Eliot to hurtle himself overboard just before the energy dome overtakes the boat, seemingly petrifying his friend still onboard. Hours later, Eliot awakens on the shore of Dinosaur Island and begins an investigation that will change his life forever. He begins to discover an uncontrollable madness unleashed in the meteor's wake, and as one secret uncovers another, he pieces together a horrifying revelation that could lead to the end of life on Earth.</p>\n<p>The player controls rescue expert Eliot Ballade, or heavy weapons specialist Dogs Bower, as they wield hand-to-hand moves and 22 weapons in an adventure that will require them to swim, drive, climb, fight and blast through seven areas and 230 locations; solving puzzles, avoiding hazards and discovering and using up to 75 items, such as security cards and life ropes. The player can switch between the 2 characters at any time to utilize their different skills to their advantage: Eliot being able to handle 2 weapons at a time, swim and move quicker; Dogs being able to equip heavier weapons and last longer in a fight with his higher constitution. Along the way, the player will encounter certain situations where they will have the chance to rescue someone or perform some other task, usually receiving a new weapon or item upon completion; however, the game will go on even if the side-mission is not successful. The player will be aided by Kimra-Tech Security agent Janine King and the mysterious angel-like entity referred to as Nephilim as they battle mutated monsters and solve the mysteries of Dinosaur Island.</p>\n<p>Blue Stinger controls much like most Survival Horrors of the time, but plays more like a straight-up Action title with Adventure elements. The player is encouraged to engage the enemies encountered, as not only do they drop coins which can be used to purchase health packs, new weapons and ammo; but they respawn upon re-entry of most locations, allowing for a technically infinite number of coins to be collected, and thus health and ammo. Even when the player does find themselves out of ammo, Eliot can equip himself from a number of unlimited-use melee weapons that are just as powerful as the ranged ones. Health packs, taking the form of food and drinks, must be used in realtime, the player having to ensure the safety of their character while the eating or drinking animation plays out. Though limited in scope, the island is fully open to explore and requires some backtracking as new items are found or developments are reached, as the player advances through a story progressed in game-engine cutscenes and radio chatter between Eliot, Dogs and Janine. Bosses are encountered regularly, some being stronger versions of more commonly-encountered enemies and playing out much like tougher battles with those; while others are unique and require the player to determine their behaviors and patterns to defeat them. Puzzles are mostly of the minor, find-the-item and use-it-in-the-right-place variety. Though environmental hazards appear in a number of locations, the game does not delve into Platformer territory as the actions required to pass these sections are either as simple as navigating around them or context-sensitive to the particular situations.</p>\n<p>The Japanese version of the game featured a camera system that employed cinematic angles and perspectives intended to provide a more suspenseful experience. This system, however, was met with a negative critical reaction by some and was revamped by Activision into a behind-the-back third-person angle a-la Action-Adventure games for the US and European releases.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Arcadia is a world where continents float high above, and people travel by airships. Among the countries of this world, the most powerful one is the Empire of Valua. Guided by its greedy admirals, Valua strives to possess all the power in Arcadia. The boy Vyse and the girl Aika are members of the Blue Rogues - noble pirates who attack only Valuan warships. During one of their confrontations with a battleship, they encounter a girl named Fina, who is on an important mission whose secret she cannot tell yet. Involved in the conflict with the Empire of Valua, the trio of the heroes must explore the whole world of Arcadia in order to defeat the admirals.</p>\n<p><em>Skies of Arcadia</em> is a traditional Japanese role-playing game with turn-based combat and randomly appearing enemies. Player-controlled party contains up to four active combatants. During battles, characters attack physically, use items, or cast magic spells, which deplete magic points as well as spirit points (SP). Each character is also able to \"focus\", which restores spirit points. Once the common spirit bar is filled, characters can unleash powerful special attacks. Enemies may be resilient or vulnerable to particular elements; elemental affinities of weapons can be switched at any time during battles.</p>\n<p>Besides the usual party-based combat, there are also airship battles in the game. These usually occur at specific plot points and involve the player-controlled airship fighting another ship or a giant creature. These battles are round-based, with the player planning several turns ahead, using various kinds of ship weapons (cannons, torpedoes, etc.). </p>\n<p>The airship is available to the player since the beginning of the game and can be navigated physically; the game's \"world map\" consists entirely of air space, with islands that can be accessed only by airship. Most locations, however, can only be explored after having advanced the story and received an ability that would grant the player access to unexplored areas. The airship's combat abilities can be improved by customizing it to a degree, and by recruiting crew members in various parts of the world.</p>",

        "description": "<p>It is Christmas of the year 2000. In the skies over Canada, Laura's plane has been hijacked by terrorists. The plane is filled with screams, shouts and fear as the hijackers terrorize the passengers and crew. In one of the seats a black-robed magician gazes into a crystal, chanting the phrase \"Shadow, the final destroyer\". Laura's compact begins to glow. A vision of a meteorite hurtling towards the Earth is reflected in the mirror. Suddenly the plane is struck by the same meteorite that appeared in the vision, and falls towards the frozen tundra below.</p>\n<p>In the middle of a raging blizzard, Laura opens her eyes to find herself inside a mountain cabin. She was saved by Kimberly, one of the passengers of the wrecked plane. Ten days have passed since the crash but Laura can remember nothing, not even her name. The door of the cabin opens and one of the terrorists enters. While Kimberly and Laura stare in horror, he transforms into a hideous monster. He is not the only one. Other crash survivors and locals have mutated into terrifying monstrosities and attacked people. Is there anyway to survive this living nightmare? At present it is shrouded in mystery.</p>\n<p><em>D-2</em> is a follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4410/d/\"> D</a>, though the two games are not directly connected to each other story-wise and also have significant differences in gameplay. <em>D-2</em> combines a horror theme with shooter and role-playing elements. Exploring the vast snowy landscape and investigating the surroundings triggers extensive cutscenes that advance the narrative. The 3D engine allows free navigation around the world, though in-door locations have first-person navigation with limited movement. It is also possible to pilot a snowmobile, hunt for food, and capture photos. </p>\n<p>Horrifying monsters will attack randomly (or serve as boss fights at specific points of the plot), at which point the player is taken to a separate combat screen. Laura must dispatch of the enemies by rapidly shooting at them, in a way not dissimilar to the shooting sequences of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7524/snatcher/\"> Snatcher</a>. Enemies can attack from different sides, so the player often has to turn around and quickly react to their attacks. Laura's default gun is weak, but uses unlimited ammunition; stronger guns with limited ammo can be found by exploring the surroundings. Laura receives experience points for defeating enemies and eventually levels up, becoming stronger and having her hit points increased.</p>",

Four teenage horror fans, Eriko Christy, Kevin Kertsman, Randy Fairbanks, and Michel Waters, receive invitations to the ghastly park. Filled with enthusiasm, Kevin, Randy, and Michel carelessly rush to Illbleed, leaving behind young Eriko. Eriko eventually heads to Illbleed to search for her now-missing friends. Eriko must find her friends, survive the horrors of Illbleed, and get out alive, if she can.</p>\n<p>Each \"amusement\" in Illbleed is based on one of Michael Reynolds' horror films, from the worm infested drive-in theater of <em>Revenge of the Worm</em> to the trap-laden supermarket of <em>Killer Department Store</em>. The player can choose to play a level with any of the kids that have been rescued, and one character is trapped in each of the attractions. Robots modeled on the movies' monsters populate each attraction as well, and each is programmed to attack and kill attendees. In addition to the robots, every room in an attraction is fitted with traps to surprise and hurt. If the player character becomes too surprised they'll die of a heart attack. Prize money is awarded for surviving each attraction, and can be used to upgrade a character's stats or buy items.</p>",

As you approach the deck of the carrier, your helicopter is shot down.  After crash landing on the deck, it is your job to investigate what exactly is going on, and escape alive.</p>\n<p>The game is played from a third person perspective.  You move Jack around the ship, shooting enemies and solving simple puzzles along the way.  The main goal of the game is to survive, so you have to be careful about conserving ammo and health upgrades.  After you solve the game playing as Jack, you can play through the game again as Jessifer Manning, one of your teammates.  While playing as Jessifer, you get an entirely different view of the same story.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Some of the greatest adventures that kids have growing up occur in their imaginations as they play with their toys. <em>Toy Commander</em> is a game that attempts to capture these adventures in an interactive, three dimensional world. The player's perspective is that of the toy vehicles that inhabit a house. The various gameplay areas are all based on rooms in this giant house. </p>\n<p>Gameplay in <em>Toy Commander</em> is mission based. In each mission, the player controls one or more toy vehicles to accomplish certain objectives. The objectives in each mission vary widely. In some missions, the player must drive an army truck and shoot things, in some it is necessary to fly helicopters to pick up and drop off objects, and in some the player races against computer-controlled vehicles. </p>\n<p>There is a storyline that ties together the missions in the single player mode. A coalition of old toys has started a rebellion against the new toys in the house. An evil Teddy Bear, the Toy Commander, is leading this rebellion. It's the player's job to stop him. In each mission, the basic goal is to complete the task in as short a time as possible. If the player meets a certain time goal, the mission is completed. By completing four missions, the player gets to challenge the boss character in the room. If the boss is successfully destroyed, he will assist the player character in the final fight against the Toy Commander.</p>\n<p>In addition to the single player mode, there is a 4-player simultaneous deathmatch mode.</p>",

As you go through the game you level up, tweak your items with the great Ancients system, and gain new spells. It is also possible to forge weapons and to imbue them with runes.

First up is the Championship.  In this mode, you compete in a series of circuit races and accumulate points based on your finishing position.  The racer with the most points at the end of the season wins.  The other modes include a trick competition, a hazard and obstacle course, and a head-to-head 2-player mode.</p>",

Pursuing the assailant, Sword finds a strange book and opens it. Everything changes, and the hero is teleported into another dimension. It appears that several other heroes beside him were lost in this dimension, each coming from a different world. Sword's task is to locate these heroes and find a way to bring them back to their respective worlds.</p>\n<p><em>Time Stalkers</em> is a role-playing game with turn-based combat, heavily oriented towards dungeon crawling. The player controls Sword and other heroes, some of which are characters from other games made by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/2966/climax-entertainment/\">Climax Entertainment</a>, such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7005/shining-in-the-darkness/\">Shining in the Darkness</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6955/landstalker/\">Landstalker</a>, and others. Even though the player controls a party of characters, only one hero can lead it at a time. The rest of the party members consist of monsters, which can be captured in combat and recruited.</p>\n<p>Combat requires precise positioning of the characters in order to execute attacks and capture monsters. A peculiar feature of the game is the reversion of the characters' level to 1 upon completing a dungeon. The characters retain the items and the skills they have learned, but start again at the lowest level in the next dungeon.</p>",

The people who saw you during your sleep named you the Sleeper. You were discovered by an archaeological team, and an ancient machine, which was dubbed \"Elemental Gimmick Gear\" by the archaeologists, was found near you. Players take the control of the Sleeper, who has no memory of who he really is and what he had been doing before he awakened. Having awakened from a very long sleep, the Sleeper sets out to discover his past, stop the contamination of the planet which is caused by Fogna: the mysterious ruins he was found in, as well as find out the purpose of the mysterious Elemental Gimmick Gear.</p>\n<p>This game is an Action RPG with a lot of emphasis on puzzle-solving. The player can move around the battlefield, using various physical attacks, such as punching, extending the arm or spinning. Players will also unlock elemental (magic-like) attacks which will be useful for longer range attacks, finding secret areas with capsules and solving some of the game's puzzles. In total, there are 4 types of elements to unlock with some of the skills utilizing multiple elements.</p>\n<p>There is no leveling up in this game. Thus, improving stats is done by either collecting 3 capsules of 3 different types (Attack, Defense or Mind) or an Energy Tank which will increase the Sleeper's max HP.</p>\n<p>The game is mostly 2D, featuring hand drawn backgrounds. However, during boss battles and in the spin racing mini-game, the game switches into a 3D mode.</p>\n<p>There are also a few mini-games included within the game, such as a 3D spin racing game and a few missions which involve spinning, activating switches and collecting as many points as possible while reaching the finish line before time runs out.</p>\n<p>Also, while traveling, players can find and gather Metamos: small creatures that can be raised by feeding them with elements. These creatures, after having grown, can be interacted with to restore or lose health and elements, as well as gain more capsules.</p>",

Every faction has three vehicles (small, medium and large) with different armor and speed.</p>\n<p>In online mode, this game supports 4 player vs. 4 player battles. A special catch is the usage of the Dreamcast microphone which allows you to speak either with all players or only your own team.</p>\n<p>In single player mode, there are 30 missions for each side. You move from mission to mission in a branching storyline with multiple endings. Additionally there is an arcade mode in which the goal is to kill all aliens in a limited time.</p>",

Thus each of these nations is represented in close proximity and in direct conflict to one another.</p>\n<p>The gameplay takes place over a series of single-player flight missions in which your American pilot will fight against the Axis forces and ally with the British.

Exploration parts mainly develop in Napple with a third person view, while the platformer levels, the four seasons, gets a 2D side-scrolling camera. In side-scrolling levels, Arsia usually has to complete the level and fight against a boss. Several levels requires certain items or people to talk to, meaning that the player might need to revisit some levels several times to go on with the quest.</p>\n<p>The game setting is influenced by European fairy tale tradition, with classical cartoon-looking characters (somewhat reminding of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Alice+in+Wonderland\">Alice in Wonderland</a>) and colored houses. For example, Pierrot the clown, talking trees, and a cow barman appear in the game.</p>\n<p><em>Napple Tale</em> also offers micro-management with pets, items, and a complex process to create new creatures or items by combining several of them in various ways (similar to the store in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4070/power-stone-2/\">Power Stone 2</a> or all games of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Atelier\">Atelier</a> series).

        "description": "<p>The first exclusively-downloadable Dreamcast VMU game, made available on the Dreamcast Network in September 1999, is a remake of the classic Mattel handheld LED football game, but in first person perspective. </p>\n<p>The player is represented by a football at the bottom of the screen. Up to three defenders can be seen directly in front of the player, as far as 5 yards away. The player is tackled if a defender touches the ball. </p>\n<p>The action is controlled via the Dreamcast VMU's directional pad. Pressing forward moves the player one yard forward, and pressing left or right moves the ball to the left or right of the screen. The player has 4 chances (downs) to make 10 yards. If a first down is made, another 4 downs are awarded. The object of the game is to run the ball in for a touchdown and beat the opponent.</p>\n<p>On fourth down, the player can opt to kick the ball. If the user is inside fifty yards of the end zone, a field goal is attempted. Outside the fifty yard line, the ball is punted. Kick distance is determined via a mini-game where the user times a button press to a moving power bar.</p>\n<p>There is no defense in this game. In a player vs. CPU game, the opposing team's offensive outcome (touchdown, field goal, punt, turnover) is determined at random. The game can also be played by two players, with a hand-off after each possession. It's perfect for when you're with a friend and waiting in line at a movie theater.</p>",

This city is constructed with the help of the most modern industry, based on an operation system that is capable to create the most progressive form of urban life - the so-called \"intelligent city\". But something goes wrong. It seems like a virus that creates a fire substance inside of human beings' bodies. The disease soon became known under the name \"Spontaneous Human Combustion\". Particularly one district of the newly built Izanami City seems suspicious. Kento Rando, a high school student and an apprentice detective, is given a mission to investigate the mysterious case. Seigai High School is going to be the principal area of investigation. Needless to say that in order to solve the case, Kento will have to find the best strategy talking to the beautiful high school female students...</p>\n<p><em>Kaen Seibo</em> is a Japanese-style adventure which relies largely on conversations and the choices you make during them. However, the game also contains elements of Western-style adventuring. There are items that must be found, picked up and used at appropriate moments. There are areas where you can move through a 3D-like environment, viewing it from first-person perspective. During the dialogues, you also have commands that are accessible through a menu. There are also segments with a time limit.</p>",

Sosei</em> is a follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=D%C5%8Dkoku+Soshite...\"> D\u014dkoku Soshite...</a>, featuring a similar story premise and gameplay. The protagonist of the game, a high-school student, finds himself and other characters (mostly female high-school students) trapped in a marine research facility. Exploring the abandoned building, the hero discovers the research staff died under mysterious circumstances. Was this a murder committed by a human being, or some sort of an unknown evil force? The hero does not have much time to think, since whatever took the lives of the scientists also threatens to murder them...</p>\n<p>Like its predecessor, the game is a hybrid of Japanese and Western adventure styles. The player navigates the protagonist around the facility over an isometric map, entering rooms and exploring them. In many places there are traps that should be avoided, and puzzles to solve. Most puzzles involves finding and manipulating inventory items. Some puzzles have multiple solutions, and sometimes the solutions the player chooses lead to different endings. Like in many other Japanese adventures, multiple endings also depend on the protagonist's behavior towards the girls who are trapped with him. Added to <em>Revive... Sosei</em> are timed sequences, during which the player's inability to act quickly might lead to a premature end.</p>",

She infiltrates Umbrella Corporation's headquarters in Paris, where she is captured and knocked out. When she comes to, she finds herself in a prison on a remote island. Freed by a friendly guard, Claire faces several problems. Not only is the island under attack by an unknown assailant, but there has been another outbreak of the T-Virus and the island is crawling with zombies and other mutated creatures. Claire not only has to face the undead, but also the commander of the base, a mad aristocrat with family ties to the origins of Umbrella Corporation and the T-Virus. And escaping from the island is only the beginning of Claire's ordeals.</p>\n<p><em>Code: Veronica</em> continues the survival horror gameplay of its predecessors: the protagonist explores the surroundings, fighting monsters and solving puzzles. However, Code: Veronica is the first game in the series to do away with pre-rendered backgrounds, using a fully polygonal 3D engine instead, which allows for features such as real-time lighting and camera movement. Still, such movements are only used sparingly, and the use of perspective is mostly unchanged from earlier installments: the camera automatically switches to different static angles, showing the protagonist, monsters, and rooms from different spooky viewpoints.</p>\n<p>Most of the weapons from the earlier games make return appearances: knife, handguns, shotgun, grenade launcher, and crossbow are all featured. There are also new weapons including a sniper rifle, an AK-47, and several guns only found in pairs, which can be used to target two enemies at the same time. Several weapons upgrades can also be found.</p>\n<p>Similar to the earlier games, the player will not only control Claire, but also two other characters: Claire's fellow prisoner Steve, and her brother Chris.</p>",

Twenty-two years after the World War III, an organization known as <em>Church</em> has taken power. You play as Allure Valentine, a girl who was recruited by the Church as an undercover agent. On one of her missions, Allure boards a train that crashes shortly thereafter. Her first task will be to find a way out of the underground tunnel and to discover who or what was behind that crash.</p>\n<p>The game is a RPG with elements of pure adventure. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective. You fight enemies in turn-based battles, but instead of usual party you have several \"minds\", a kind of summoned monsters who will fight together with Allure. They will heal or attack the enemy using special \"mind attacks\" of various elements - love, curse, etc. In adventure mode, you explore the environments by pressing the A button, which will highlight objects you can interact with. The movements are shown as short CG sequences, similar to many Western-style adventures.</p>",

You control Abel, an angel who serves a female demon master (which you choose among several available characters in the beginning of the game). You and your master develop deep feelings for each other, but then your master disappears, and you decide to find her at all costs.</p>\n<p>The Dreamcast release comes on 2 GDs (instead of the single CD of the original), and features many anime-style cutscenes that were not included in the Saturn version. Also, the story cutscenes which happen after the battle don't use the isometric battle engine any more, but are viewed from first-person perspective, with character portraits occupying a large portion of the screen. Other differences include the addition of two scenarios (12 instead of the original 10), a new difficulty level (Easy), different art for character portraits, several changes in battle locations, and new plot details.</p>",

You need to remove all of the tiles in each challenging puzzle before time runs out. You can only remove tiles that match and are free on one side to be removed. You'll have to use lots of strategy to make your way through this variant of Mahjong that has also gone by the name of Shanghai.</p>\n<p>What sets Maqiupai apart from the other versions of Shanghai that have been released is how the game is played - there are two modes to Maqiupai: Challenge and Time Attack. In challenge, you will set to the task of removing tiles as quickly as possible. You work as the clock works against you, counting down to your fate. Luckily, you have the use of Shinobi Jokers on your side - tiles that will clear the board of any other tiles like them. After you have unlocked a table in Challenge mode, you will be able to play it in Time Attack and compete with others from around the world by submitting your highest scores online!</p>",

You are cast in the role of a young woman named Kei, a police officer who specializes in counter-terrorist activities. One day she and her boyfriend (also a policeman) receive an assignment to investigate a murder that occurred in a hotel. The investigation gradually leads to a confrontation with a mysterious evil man who seems to know a lot about Kei's past, which was concealed from her...</p>\n<p>The game is a third-person shooter with strong elements of survival horror, somewhat similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3681/fear-effect/\"> Fear Effect</a> games. Kei uses guns in order to dispatch of the enemies. She can side-step and roll to avoid the enemies' attacks. Ammunition and health kits are rare, and there is a possibility to steal them from the enemies. Kei can communicate with the police station by using her cat, which is a disguised communication device.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Tetris 4D</em> is a fairly standard <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tetris:+The+Soviet+Challenge\">Tetris</a> game that was released in Japan shortly after the Dreamcast launched.</p>\n<p>The game features two modes, Classic and Battle. Classic mode offers a normal solitaire Tetris game: rotate and fit falling blocks to complete lines. Five difficulty settings are available, which change the speed and piece preview settings.</p>\n<p>The sound and graphics generally follow a modern urban/industrial theme, with five techno music choices, including a variation of the classic Tetris \"Karinka\". The 3D backgrounds are basic but shift viewpoint as you advance in levels.</p>\n<p>The Battle mode offers two to four player multiplayer. One player starts off flagged, and blocks push up from the bottom as other players make lines. Once he makes enough lines himself the flag moves to another player. Difficulty is set independently allowing for handicaps.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, you can't play the battle mode against the computer. There's also no VMU support for saving high scores, a rather critical omission for this type of game.</p>",

The professor must stop her, so her sends Super Magnetic Neo, a little boy robot with a powerful electromagnet on his head.</p>\n<p>The game has some resemblance to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Crash+bandicoot\">Crash Bandicoot series</a> in that some levels have you running toward the camera, have a side-view, or have you riding an animal. It contains some running, jumping and switch-flipping much like any 3D platformer. However, it does have a unique magnetism aspect. Positive and Negative charges are represented by red and blue. Neo's head can act as a positive or negative pole. This is called his magnogimmick. Using the principle of opposites charges attract and similar charges repel, Neo can pull himself toward platforms, then launch off them, or navigate many related environmental puzzles such as pulling himself into teleporters or swinging on magnetic pendulums. Enemies also come in red and blue and can pulled pulled in to be captured or pushed away to be avoided accordingly.</p>\n<p>You must use all these skills to make it through all four sections of Pao Pao Park and defeat Pinki.</p>\n<p>There is also a challenge mode, with a series of short stages to pass all based around proper use of the magnogimmick. It's something like the VR missions in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/380/metal-gear-series/\">Metal Gear series</a>.</p>",

Walls will move in different ways depending on the gates they are connected to, either rotating around a gate or moving forward one space.</p>\n<p>In addition to guiding the king to the goal, the player must also ensure that a certain number of walls are connected to a specific wall, which glows red, by the gates. If the king falls in a hole or gets squished between two walls, or if the wrong number of walls are connected at the end of the stage, the stage is lost and must be tried again.</p>\n<p>Cutscenes are interspersed throughout the game, which tell the story in sequences of still images and text.

Like the previous game in the series this simulation game allows the player to fish for bass on various lakes. At the start of the game the player can pick one of various characters. Each character has his or her own stats such as casting distance, which makes them all unique. Each character's appearance can be altered by the player as well.</p>\n<p>Using sonar the player can cruise around the lake until he find a good fishing spot. Besides the location the player can also pick the month, time of day and weather in which he wants to fish. All these factors are calculated when it comes to determining what kind of fish he or she is likely to catch. To aid the player there's 100 different kinds of lures to fish with.</p>\n<p>The game is meant to be played with the special fishing rod controller.</p>\n<p>There are two game modes: free fishing and tournament mode. In the first you can do what you wish and try to improve on your own records. In the latter mode you have to compete against NPCs or another player. There are various tiers of difficulty.</p>",

When scientists searched for new materials to enhance their space ships, they discovered a new and powerful material they dubbed DUX. Since this type of material proved unstable, nobody except the player seemed brave enough to fly the space ship constructed from it. The player's job is to lead the ship through a series of horizontal levels against the Spiritual Spacers \"to reach the obvious.\"</p>\n<p>The player's ship has a standard laser shot that can be upgraded or changed for x-ray and bounce shots, which are very similar to the weapons in R-Type. The player also has a pod that protects them from enemy bullets and that can be launched as an offensive weapon in a move called \"dash.\" Keeping the fire button pressed will launch a more powerful hyper shot.</p>\n<p>To score points, the player can destroy chains of enemies in quick succession or soak up chains of bullets. Hyper Soaking makes the player invulnerable to bullets, but drains the Obvious Energy gauge if not enough bullets are soaked in or new energy orbs are picked up. The player wins the game if they manage to beat all the bosses at the end of each level. If they are hit by a bullet or collide with their surroundings, a life is lost. After all lives and continues are depleted, the game is over.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Charge 'N Blast</em> is a shooting game where you play as one of three marines who have to rid the earth of alien scum. The gameplay is similar to Cabal, you move left and right dodging enemies while charging up you weapons to blast them away.</p>\n<p>There are three different marines you can choose from, each with their own set of weapons. As usual there is the balanced character (Johnny Rock), a weaker but faster one (Pamela Hewitt) and a slower but stronger one (Nicholas Woods).</p>\n<p>You can choose to play in one player mode, time attack or two player mode. The missions are broken up into small areas where you have to kill all enemies before moving on to the next area. Each mission ends with a boss character such as a giant insect or a Godzilla-like monster.</p>\n<p>Use the X, Y or B buttons to choose a weapon, press A to charge and shoot and aim with analog stick. There are different types of weapons that can be used on the different types of enemies. For example the single missiles for far away targets and torpedoes for underwater enemies.</p>\n<p>You can fire your weapon continuously, but this doesn't do as much damage compared to a fully charged shot. Charging each shot means you have to aim a little more carefully, but you'll especially need this in the later levels. You can dodge enemies with the L and R buttons.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Lack of Love</em> (or <em>L.O.L.</em>) can be considered a genre-defying game, though it has strong elements of adventure (problem-solving based on exploration) and RPG (character growth and management). The game's unusual premise is the evolution of an alien being. In the beginning the player takes control of a tiny, newborn creature. The alien world is harsh, so the \"hero\" has to constantly improve, learn new things and avoid being eaten by other animals. To make the new life even harder, an alien robot race just discovered the planet and starts colonizing it. Surviving is obviously not easy...</p>\n<p>The game is played from a third-person perspective with pre-rendered backgrounds. Since the protagonist is an animal, the game doesn't have any ingame texts; for solving riddles the player is totally dependent on experimentation and careful observation of the environment. To reach the next state of evolution the player will also need to help other beings - as a reward they will give the controlled creature energy balls or new abilities required for further progress.</p>\n<p>Besides the usual actions like attacking, biting, and talking (or, better to say, communicating) the creature can perform somewhat strange actions such as sleeping and urinating, which are essential to the gameplay.</p>",

These squares will be continuously deleted from the play field in exchange for points. </p>\n<p><em>Irides</em> features an exciting campaign with 28 carefully designed, individual levels. Each level has its own specific mission or challenge. The player is required to simply score a certain number of points, delete a certain number of squares, clear the play field from already existing squares, battle against time or recreate a shape of squares on the play field. In addition, the player can unlock four carefully hidden bonus levels, with more, secret challenges. </p>\n<p>An important aspect of <em>Irides</em> are the more than 15 individual powerups. Most of these special squares can be used to your advantage and help you complete your specific mission. There are bomb squares, squares that delete a certain color, or drill a hole in the playfield, as well as squares that have to be deleted more then once, in order for them to disappear from the field. </p>\n<p><em>Irides</em> is also OpenFeint enabled. Allowing players to challenge their friends for the highest score, interact with other players and friends in chat rooms or unlock achievements. </p>\n<p>On top of that, <em>Irides</em> features some 30 minutes of music and sound effects, specifically designed for the game.</p>",

Options are also the usual on these kind of games - change half lenght (3,5 or 10 minutes), opponent level and game speed. At gametime, players can also choose the weather, time of day, and between 10 cameras. There are six stadiums to choose from, inspired by venues such as the old Wembley Stadium, the Nou Camp or the ArenA in Amsterdam.</p>",

To do this the players had to use clues presented on the internet (using the Orange Dreamkey CD for internet access). All that was needed to enter was to purchase the game at certain retailers for the low price of \u00a5980. The promotional period was between March 20 through April 11, 1999.</p>\n<p>In the game the player is cast as Sega's former Senior Managing Director <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Hidekazu+Yukawa\">Hidekazu Yukawa</a>, presented as a cartoon character. From a top-down perspective the player navigates between different screens and using a limited amount of digs with a shovel, Yukawa needs to find certain pieces of puzzles (all with a Dreamcast theme) to match the online hints given through the internet via the Dreamcast. If he manages to complete the correct picture, the player was eligible to enter the raffle where the prize money was at stake.</p>\n<p>There is also a VMU mini-game included which could be downloaded to aid further in the quest and make digging for treasure faster.</p>",

However, the course is varied sometimes, as several levels include vertically scrolling passages, and some bosses need to be beaten in a given amount of time.</p>\n<p>The game features three different weapons which are given from the start, but can be lost in the course of the game: whenever the ship is hit (the ship is destroyed on the third hit), the currently selected weapon is destroyed. Weapons can be regained by shooting and afterwards collecting a certain kind bonus item. Initially, the item is a score bonus, but once shot, it transforms into a weapon upgrade, further shots will alter the kind of weapon which will be upgraded. A lost weapon can be recovered by collecting the corresponding upgrade, any further improvement by collecting more upgrade requires the weapon be selected. Apart from upgrades, the direction of firing can be switched from forwards to backwards, and another fire mode allows to save up energy for devastating, R-Type-inspired beam.</p>\n<p>A number of bonuses like art galleries can be unlocked, and Sturmwind also features a number of achievements like completing any level with only using a certain weapon.\nHighscores can be entered on a website for comparison by entering a code given by the game.</p>",

Next day, he sees the exact same murder on the TV news.</p>\n<p>Most of the game is happening on a fictional OS desktop where you can further access pre-defined set of applications. Web lets you access 18 different web channels with over 150 home pages which contain various things and mini-games, some to move the story forward, some just to create more believable atmosphere. Mail system keeps all the received e-mails notifying you of new ones and those you read, with ability to delete them if you wish. Data application consists of files and movies. It lets you watch all the movies you have seen so far. The remaining applications are more system oriented, config lets you change game configuration (field, speed, sound, and screen), and the file application is used to save or load a savegame file.</p>",

While the PSX version supports PocketStation, the Dreamcast version uses visual memory which also uses graphical representation of the character you are interacting with, and emphasizes what is currently happening on the main screen. You can meet the girls, buy them gifts, talk to them, check the progress status, and play various mini-games. The game also includes printed stickers of all three heroines with some additional artwork as well.</p>",

So, you decide to take those three weeks of holidays to return to your hometown and give your best to come up with something solid or completely give up on wanting to become a picture book writer. Your hometown is a couple of hours from Tokyo by bullet train, though it is a rather rural area so it requires a switch to a more local train. Upon your arrival, you soon team up with Erina, an old friend of yours, and the two of you keep on exploring town, going places an meeting people. One night, walking alone in the woods, you get caught by the rain. Running to find a shelter, you stumble upon a small shrine. There, in front of your eyes, you see a flying silhouette which soon gets zapped by the thunder and falls down not far from where you are. Not sure what you saw really happened, you come outside and see a small fairy, down on the ground under the rain and with a wounded wing. You pick her up and tend to her wound. She quickly tests her fixed wings and flies away with a smile. As the morning comes, you look over town and has a sudden vision of an unknown place. Whatever happened to you granted you certain magical abilities you are not aware of.</p>\n<p>The game takes place in your hometown which represents reality, and a fantasy Layer world. In either world you can freely move around the map and talk to various characters you run along the way. Your hometown is split into six districts and different events and characters can be seen at different time of the day (morning, noon, evening, or night). When in Layer world, whenever important advance is being made, a battle scene which takes action on a separate combat arena will occur. The battle itself is real-time and consists of you trying to throw objects or use attacks against the boss. During adventure mode, when entering certain area from the map, the gameplay will resemble that of a regular visual novel with static backgrounds and character stills over it, varying in poses to emphasize their disposition. As dialogues are often short, dialogue choices are not used, but occasional actions you can perform are offered depending on the time and location.</p>",

Quick flashback to a couple of days ago, as you were waiting for your father at the airport to return from a negotiation mission from a country devastated by the civil war, to your surprise, he brought someone with him. That someone was Sandia, a princess of the country he just returned from, in danger for her life. It just so happens she'll be staying with your from now on, indefinitely as it seems.</p>\n<p>You are Kouki Akiba, a high-school student with a regular boring school life with nothing to cause your sudden elevation in blood pressure. But that's about to change when princess Sandia who recently started living with you enters the same school you are attending. But where there are problems, there are obstacles to overcome, which may over short period of time lead to something more than just friendship between Kouki and Sandia.</p>\n<p>The game itself is similar to the majority of visual novels in terms of basic gameplay, but differs in the artwork style which sets it apart from most of them.

        "description": "<p>Originally released for PC (Windows) as an adult adventure game, the ports to Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 removed the adult content, included a new heroine and extended the story. You play as Ryouichi Katsuragi, a young doctor and a family physician summoned to tend to an old man living in a huge mansion on the island in Italy. Upon arriving to the island in a helicopter, the game switches to 3rd-person perspective where you can freely explore the mansion and its surroundings and interact with various characters, including the mansion maids which act as heroines in this story. During 1st-person perspective mode, the game plays like a typical visual novel where you converse with other characters which are non-animated but feature voice-acting. The player choices during dialogues affect the story and key choices branch it toward a different ending. The bonus features which are accessible from the main menu are music player and unlockable heroine gallery.</p>",

The story takes place in present time during your reunion with your childhood friends, as well as during past time during your childhood days.</p>\n<p>The art style in this game is rather unique in comparison to typical visual novel anime art style. The background art uses somewhat a mix of a life-like re-touched images and anime drawings. While characters use voice-acting in this Dreamcast exclusive visual novel, the animation is non-existent during dialogues.

        "description": "<p><em>My Merry May</em> is the first game in a planned (but unfinished) trilogy, originally released for Dreamcast in 2002, followed by a PlayStation 2 port later that year. The story revolves around Kyousuke Watarase (\u6e21\u826f\u702c \u606d\u4ecb), a high-school student, who one day received a strange package. In that package was Reu (\u30ec\u30a5), an AI android in a form of a young girl who ends up living with him under pretense of being his sister.</p>\n<p>The game plays as a typical visual novel romance which includes reading on-screen text over background art and character sprites who come in different poses and gestures, but are not animated. Key moments feature special CG artwork to emphasize certain scene and break out from a typical \"character sprite over background art\" presentation. Aside from main characters, all the heroines feature full voice-acting. Player's choices allow the story to branch toward one of the several different endings, some endings focusing on your relationship with a specific heroine.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mizuiro</em> (\u307f\u305a\u3044\u308d) was originally released as an adult visual-novel, which yielded this console port for PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast two years later. The game follows the story of Kenji Katase (\u7247\u702c \u5065\u4e8c), a high-school student who lives with his adopted sister, Yuki (\u96ea\u5e0c). One day, Kenji's childhood friend, Hiyori Hayasaka (\u65e9\u5742 \u65e5\u548c), re-appears in his life and his long-gone feelings of affection toward her started to awaken.</p>\n<p>As is the case with many romance-driven visual novels, your choices will determine how the story branches, and your actions will drive the story toward the heroine of your interest. While this console game version removed the adult content, it added additional character and story content with new CG events. As you play through the games, you unlock CG gallery for heroines which is accessible via main menu, along with the music player.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Gundam Side Story 0079: Rise from the Ashes</em> is a mech combat simulation set in the Gundam universe. Created to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the franchise, it presents an original story set during the One Year War between the Earth Federation and Zeon, parallel to the events of the first Gundam TV series. It takes place in Australia and stars the mobile suit team White Dingo, a guerrilla combat unit supporting the main forces of a Federation counteroffensive against the Zeonic forces.</p>\n<p>The player controls Lt. Rayer, who along with his team mates Leung, Mike and Anita must fight Zeon in nine missions. Before each mission, briefings from Commander Hawkins and messages from the teammates are shown as FMV sequences. The squad of three mobile suits (Anita controls the OASIS hover truck) must be outfitted by choosing suits, weapons, and shields. Two suits are available from the start: RGM-79 and RGC-80, with the RGC more heavily armed and armored at the cost of reduced mobility. Further suits become available for special mission objectives later in the game. The choice of weapons includes various projectile and beam weapons, along with rocket launchers and grenades. Weapons differ in ammo (some have unlimited shots, others have magazines and thus a short reloading time), range and power.</p>\n<p>Missions are seen from a first-person cockpit perspective, but also employ in-engine cutscenes to show plot developments. Mission objectives usually include the destruction of a specific enemy unit or structure, but goals can change mid-mission. Leung and Mike fight on their own but can also be given specific orders, including movement and search patterns, attacking specific enemies or defending friendly units. They can be given preferences for long- mid- or close-range combat. Anita's OASIS truck cannot attack or defend, but can be used to detect enemies on the map through a special radar scan. Enemies include all sorts of ground soldiers, tanks, aircraft and of course mobile suits as seen in the TV show, including Zakus, Goufs and Gelgoogs. </p>\n<p>The player's suit is controlled via the directional pad for movement and the analog stick to look around. Double-pressing on the pad enables a quick dash via vernier thrusters. The thrusters can also be used to jump or hover, but can overheat and then require a cooldown period before becoming reusable. For ranged combat, the cockpit view can be switched to a sniping mode. Close combat against a mobile suit on the other hand automatically switches to a melee mode, in which the suits draw their beam sabers and duel it out.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Reel Fishing: Wild</em> is a Dreamcast-exclusive entry in the fishing simulation series. It allows players to catch two dozen species of fish in 14 different locations all over the world, from Japan to North and South America to Oceania. The Dreamcast fishing rod controller is supported for realistic castings and reel-ins.</p>\n<p>The game starts in the fishing lodge, where players can check out a fish glossary, their catch list and their stock of lures, reels and lines and rods. Going for a round of fishing is done via the fishing notebook, which presents players with a series of challenges. At the start, only one location - a Japanese mountain stream - is unlocked. To unlock others, a certain number of a particular species must be caught. Catching fish not only opens up new locations, but also gives access to new types of lures, reels and lines, and rods, which in turn allow more successful fishing.</p>\n<p>A fishing session begins with a photo-realistic first-person view of the location created through combining digitized images with some animation, like for a waterfall or swaying trees, as well as disturbances of the water surface that hint at the best places for casting. Once the line is cast and a fish moves near the lure, the view switches to a 3D underwater view, showing fish, line, and hook in close-up. Baiting, setting the hook, and reeling in the catch are then done in this view.</p>",

Offline functions as a practice mode for online, and has only two modes: Arcade (for a standard race against AI-controlled opponents) and Ghost (for a one-on-one against oneself). At the start, car selection is limited and further cars can only be unlocked by playing online.</p>\n<p>The meat of the game is in Online mode. After customizing their online persona, players start with $10.000, enough to buy a car of the lowest class. Money must be earned by racing, enabling players to buy new cars and tune them with new parts. There are three kinds of races: Standard, Trial and Vendetta.</p>\n<p>Standard races allow various ways of earning money, of which winning is only one: breaking speed limits at certain points and setting race records (highest speed, fastest lap time, leading the longest) also increase cash flow. Trial races involve wagering: a minimum amount is set by the race creator that all participants must pay to take part. The creator also sets between one and four challenges from a pool of 22 possible options. These include similar records as in the Standard races, but also challenges to always (or never) break the speed limit, bust the limit (but never twice on the same radar), get best times on specific laps, always improve times from lap to lap or not take any damage. The wagered money is distributed at the end of the race between all participants that completed their challenges, taking into account the difficulty of the challenge and the final positions of the racers. Vendetta races are always one-on-one, with the winner taking the loser's car.</p>\n<p>The game includes all the tracks from the first game (7 unique tracks in 12 configurations), adds a \"Heavy Winter\" configuration to the Canada track and adds one new track (Montreal) with three configurations, for a total of 16 different tracks, all of which can be raced in reverse or mirrored, and with weather and time of day selectable. The number of cars has been doubled from the original, adding an additional eleven.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>D+Vine[Luv]</em> (pronounced Divine Love) is a typical J-RPG, using a top-down perspective with a slightly isometric representation, which also utilizes visual novel segments for adventure elements. The player takes control of Hyde, an adventurous lad who has a knack for exploring dungeons in search of relics from the old world. One day, he arrives at the town called Arvil where he hears a rumor about a nearby unexplored cave. He heads there determined to find new relics, not minding the fact that noone's been there in ages and the place is probably infested with monsters. To his surprise, he doesn't discover and relic or a treasure, but instead, a mysterious girl named Yura. She has apparently lost her memory and can't remember anything but her name.</p>\n<p>Unlike the original PC (Windows) version released almost two years earlier, the Dreamcast port does not feature any adult content. A couple of years later, DVD PG Edition release came out which also includes adult content.</p>",

So this spring he ended up at his aunt's place and got a part-time job to manage the hot springs hotel called Harusame (\u6625\u96e8), Japanese for Spring Rain. Without a reason to object and looking forward to something that will take his mind off his recent events, in this small hot springs town surrounded by the sea and the mountains, his story begins.

Unlike in previous games, this game emphasizes word \"novel\" in its title by having the game play resemble that of a visual novel without built-in clock and time progress as in previous titles. Heroine in this story is Yuka Satou (\u4f50\u85e4 \u7531\u9999) which one day suddenly appears on your doorstep. You returned to your hometown from Tokyo for the summer, and you end up sharing a place with Yuka during the holidays. The text screen with player choices appears over the entire image instead of a dialogue window, and choices made by the player will lead to one of multiple endings.</p>",

It still revolves around Keitaro managing a house full of girls while trying to study for an entrance exam to a university he set his mind on some time ago. Naturally, distractions are plentiful and he will have his hands full. The game features original story from the franchise, and plays as an adventure visual novel with a rather original gameplay system. While you control your character through an isometric perspective, and talk to characters in a visual novel style by displaying their portraits over current background with full voice-overs for heroines during dialogues, dialogue and action choices are replaced with a command roulette system which requires good reflexes to select the wanted outcome.</p>",

The story of the two play separately in their own chapters and can be progressed in any order, one chapter at the time. While their stories start separately, their paths cross when they uncover the truth behind the bombing and how it all ties to a secret corporation known as NAX.</p>\n<p><em>July</em> is more of a visual novel where player advances through dialogues and choices, and travels to different locations, than typical adventure with clickable objects and inventory items. The map is a big part of interface and chooses many locations that player can visit as events are triggered by visiting the right place at the right time. The game uses anime style character art with pre-rendered backgrounds and occasional pre-rendered animated cut-scenes. There is no voice-acting, however, neither for player characters nor for NPCs.</p>",

This game also got ported for PlayStation 2 platform under title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Culdcept+II:+Expansion\">Culdcept II: Expansion</a> which added more cards, more maps, and new game modes. This sequel features revamped game system, graphics, and music from previous works. It is also the first game in the series with network support which allows for upload and download of various game data.</p>\n<p>The board is presented isometrically in a bird's eye view perspective with characters and creatures moving on it with the roll of a dice, while using spells and cards during attacks. Each card with a creature holds various info, such as creature's strength and health, weaknesses, items, and card strength, which determine the outcome of a combat. The story mode consists of many level boards you need to conquer as you travel the world map. The board contains different terrain types, structures, and player and AI units which fight for supremacy. Units can also be upgraded which increases the overall strength of that creature.</p>\n<p>The game also supports 1-4 player battles over network. Story mode gameplay can also be recorded and uploaded to network for other players to download and see as a replay.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Following along from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/129835/hanagumi-taisen-columns/\">first game</a>, <em>Hanagumi Taisen Columns 2</em> features a few refinements to the gameplay formula. The biggest change is the introduction of a battle mode selection system, allowing the player to choose one of four different styles to alter their character's gameplay. Forest is a balanced style which behaves like the rules of the previous game, with the player able to store up to three levels of super meter; Wind limits the player to only two levels of meter, but fills the meter more quickly; Mountain starts the player off with additional meter at the penalty of filling meter more slowly; and Fire allows the player to fill their meter to 4 but limits the maximum level of defensive attack to 2. Two additional modes are unlockable after completing certain story modes: Shadow, which starts with the player's meter completely full but with a major penalty to refilling it; and Lightning, which allows the player to fill their attack meter to 4 and grants a major boost to the speed at which they fill it, but prevents the player from using any defensive options at all.</p>\n<p>The visual novel story mode follows a similar plot to the first game, but this time focuses on a production of Shonen Red vs. Benitokage with the characters competing for the role of Shonen Red. An extra unlockable story mode becomes available once the player has unlocked the four secret characters and focuses on them specifically.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Arcade Racing Legends</em> is a homebrew arcade racing game, developed as a reminiscene of many classical <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/12/sega-corporation/\">SEGA</a> games such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3575/crazy-taxi/\">Crazy Taxi</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Outrun\">Outrun</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4569/sega-rally-2-championship/\">SEGA Rally</a> - therefore a lot of cars and tracks pick up elements from those games. In total there are 7 different tracks, ranging from Desert tracks over an underwater course to a neon-colored city at night, and 24 different cars.</p>\n<p>The game features several game modes: A \"Career\" mode with 18 different tasks (beating a given time, not touching the banks, or winning a race against computer opponents), an \"Arcade\" mode to just race against other AI players and a \"Time Trial\" mode to beat the best time and race against a ghost. The game also supports splitscreen multiplayer (called \"Duel\") for two players. New tracks in Arcade mode have to be unlocked by finishing the previous track first place against the CPU.</p>",

Create your own original unit with four types of pilots under your command: shooting, hand-to-hand combat, snipers, and anti-identification type. Choose between two modes: \"Map mode\" which moves the fleet forward and \"Battle Mode\" in which battleships and mobile suits engage in combat.</p>\n<p>If you choose offline standalone mode you can play in a tactical simulation that takes place in semi-real time on a hex-separated map. When the player unit and the enemy unit edge closer to one another they can then engage in combat.</p>",

Some members of humanity have withstood the destruction above ground, while those that moved underground would go on to lead pathetic lives controlled by a tyrannical government. As the years go by, humanity has forgotten about the devastation of nature above, and soon a war breaks out between survivors underground and those that have survived above-ground. Mechanical animals named \"DOUBLE STEED\" have been developed that transport armored vehicles known as \"STEELS LEDGE\". The under and above ground survivors battle it out in violent races with these new forms of transport.</p>",

As they fall, you may change their color: between red and blue, yellow and green, and white and purple. The player must drop a stone such that three or more of the same color are touching, causing them to disappear and stones above fall into their place. </p>\n<p>As the stones collect at the platform on the bottom of the board, their weight lowers the platform towards the bottom of the screen. The aim of the game is to beat the opponent who plays with a similar game board filling up with stones, with the game ending once either your or your opponents platform falls to the ground. As you erase stones from your board, special combinations of stones and colors allows you to further burden the opponent's platform.</p>",
