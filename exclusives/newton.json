The name comes from a popular detective TV-series with Peter Falk as Lt. Columbo. As a police investigator you are presented with a crime scene and need to figure out what's happened and who's the culprit. To do so you need to search for various points of interest by tapping the display, just like in point'n'click adventure games, only everything here happens on the same screen. </p>\n<p><em>Mystery Capers</em> features sharp static illustrations of the crime scenes and various clues that are shown in close up windows. To \"solve\" the case you need to locate crucial pieces of evidence, but there's plenty of circumstantial pieces and stuff that leads nowhere. After solving the case the game brings up a statistic screen that tells rates your performance. There are at least 40 different cases in the full registered version. Originally the game shipped on a separate PCMCIA card.</p>",

The game follows the concepts of those two dungeon crawlers very closely. There's a top-down dungeon map with very basic, albeit not ASCII-based, graphics, randomly generated levels, permadeath and easy-to follow gameplay. </p>\n<p>The player can explore maps, fight monsters, gain experience levels, collect loot and descend to the lower levels of the dungeon once he finds the stairs. The combat is made simply by exchanging blows in turn-based fashion. It is also possible to pick up items that are sometimes found on the dungeon floor and manage your armor and weapon. The full registered version features saving and loading feature, while shareware does not and limited to five levels.</p>",
