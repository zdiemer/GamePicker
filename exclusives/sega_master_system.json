        "description": "<p>The White Knights, a peacekeeping force of the Planetary System, have a mission: prevent the evil Norsa Empire from dominating the world. The Norsa base on Planet X must be destroyed: an operative named JJ is sent to infiltrate it and collect the five floppy disks that will enable him to input the self-destruct sequence into the base's mainframe computer. However, beside completing this main objective, JJ also has to find a way to rescue his friends, Apple and Champ.</p>\n<p>Based on the anime of the same name, <em>Zillion</em> is a platformer with an emphasis on exploration and problem-solving rather than on fast-paced \"jump and run\" gameplay. The game is set almost entirely in the underground base. Capsules containing key codes and power-ups are scattered around the vast environments. Common obstacles include enemy guards, tripwires, laser turrets, and force fields. Rooms must be unlocked by using computer ID cards and inputting the correct four-digit code. Specific actions such as turning off barriers, deactivating traps, etc., are sometimes required as well. </p>\n<p>JJ uses a gun similar to the Sega Master System Light Phaser to defend himself and blast open the capsules. Upgrades for health, speed, jumping ability, and gun power can be found; Opa Opa, a character from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=fantasy+zone\">Fantasy Zone</a> games, provides character enhancements. </p>\n<p>Once Apple or Champ are rescued, they can be controlled by the player, with the ability to switch between the three heroes. Each of these characters has his/her own strengths and weaknesses; Apple is physically weaker, but is able to jump higher, while Champ is stronger, but slower.</p>",

If you can get to them, that is.</p>\n<p>They're hidden inside the haunted mansion, which wouldn't be such a big deal if it weren't infested with Draculas, Bats, Fire Blowers, Mummies, and other deadly weirdos. You'll have to ward off or destroy everything that gets in your way -- no matter how grotesque it appears. Furthermore, you'll have to keep punching your way through the mansion until you find the secret key. You then have to use it to open one of the five coffins, defeat Dracula, capture the jewel he drops, and make your way out of the mansion.</p>\n<p>You play the role of Mick, and everything is going to stop you from completing these tasks and making you way out of the mansion. You just have to punch, or jump on, your enemies to defeat them. And arrows will be flying from either direction and will attempt to hit you on the head, and you must either duck or jump on them for extra points. You can jump or touch lights to freeze everything on screen for a few seconds. Rather than punching, you can collect a sword on the lower level by jumping on it as it flies past you. The sword is useful when you fight Dracula or getting rid of Fire Blowers.</p>\n<p>You start the game with three lives, and receive an additional life every 50,000 and 150,000 points. You also have an energy meter. You lose energy when you touch one of the monsters. When you run out of energy, you lose a life. You gain energy by collecting treasures scattered throughout the mansion, and it is restored when you kill a Dracula.</p>",

The question is: will Alex make his way to the arcades before 17:00?</p>\n<p><em>Alex Kidd: High-Tech World</em> allows you to resume a saved game. All you have to do is enter a password, and the game will be resumed right where you left off. The game is time-based, and events can only happen at certain times. For instance, certain characters will appear when thirty minutes of each hour is up. </p>\n<p>During the game, you can access a status screen, which helps you keep track of the time, what floor you're on, and how many map pieces you collected so far. There are six floors inside the castle, including the attic. On some floors, there are phones which you can use to either to ask a character for help, or order a pizza. There are also alternate solutions to some puzzles in the game. The demo at the start of the game may give away one of the map pieces.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Psycho Fox</em> is a platform game where you play a fox and you must get through seven worlds, consisting of three areas each. At the end of each world, there are one of seven bosses waiting to destroy you, but some of the later bosses are exactly the same as the earlier ones. The title is a bit misleading because you can also play as three other characters including Hippo, Leopard, and Monkey Boy. Each character has their own disadvantages. For example, Hippo is much slower than the other three. However, all the characters share one thing in common: they can use their fists and punch enemies as they approach them. They can also jump on them and keep knocking them in the ground until they disappear off the face of the earth. If they don't make them disappear, they will pop back out again and set out for revenge. Obstacles are scattered through each area, including spikes, cannonballs, escalators, fireballs, and steam.</p>\n<p>You start the game with three lives. Once you touch an enemy, you lose a life. Lose all of your lives, and the game is over. If the game is over, you can continue where you left off. There are several items to find, and these can help you on your quest, and one of these items are eggs. If you break any of these eggs, either the \"switch\" item or the invincibility item is revealed. If you're lucky enough, a white bag is also revealed, but more often than not, one of your enemies can pop out from inside the egg. One egg will reveal a bird which you can carry for the rest of the game. This bird may be nothing but a pest, as it hinders your progress, but you can throw it at enemies to knock them out. It can also be used as a backup, meaning that you can have enemies touching you, but it is the bird that is killed, not you.</p>\n<p>There is little chance that you'll find a white bag inside an egg, unless you go up into a secret area, which can often be found if you jump on springs that are scattered throughout the level. These white bags are useless, until you get to the bonus areas, which are at the end of each area. In these bonus stages, you can place a number of foxes on a path depending on how much white bags you've collected throughout each area.</p>",

You start out in Blackwood Forest, but depending on which scene you're in, you can travel to Cactus Desert, South Seas, Pyramid River, or Alex's home, Radaxian. More often than not, you must jump over water, and along the way, you can get power-ups such as more energy, more time, and jets that lets you fly through the scene, but only if you perform a wheelie can you get these power-ups. The game ends when you have no energy left.</p>",

For example, in Levels 3 &amp; 4, you have to shoot balls that pass through a set of pipes and come out the other end, and on Level 5, you can't shoot the spaceships if they are protected by a shield, and have to wait until the shield disappears, but not for long.

Once you have done that, you must get through one of the open doorways. To navigate the room, you can walk either on the gray tiles, or the yellow ones that surround them. Monsters also can walk on these gray tiles, but you can make them fall down if you smash a tile that they're on. The monsters will regenerate in the room after five seconds.</p>\n<p>Be careful of dragons that will throw fireballs at you. If you get hit by a dragon, its fireball, or one of the monsters, you will lose a life.\nYou can collect keys that will open locked doorways, so that you can exit through them. Some power-ups can also be collected. Collecting hearts, for example, will freeze all monsters on screen for a limited amount of time, giving you the opportunity of killing them.</p>\n<p>The game was later released in Europe as  <em>Pit Pot: The Magical Castle</em> only in a compilation titled <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=%0AAstro+Warrior+/+Pit+Pot\">Astro Warrior / Pit Pot</a>.</p>",

Your only weapon are bullets as your only defense, but if you shoot the flashing red pieces on the terrain, chances are that a green ship will approach you, and if you collect this ship, your weapons will be upgraded so that you shoot a laser beam instead. Keep collecting ships and you can shoot up to three laser beams at once. </p>\n<p>At the end of each zone, you will come across a boss that takes multiple hits to kill. If you manage to conquer all three zones, you are back to where you started. The whole point of this game is to earn as many points you can without losing all of your lives.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Long ago, in the distant land of Moralos, in a time when vast jungles still covered the Earth, an evil presence emerged from its tomb beneath the ground. His name was Gilbas, and he was about to destroy the inhabitants of the land. Aganan, a great warrior, was summoned to save the troubled land and put an end to Gilbas by sealing him in the tome from where it came.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Gilba was successfully resurrected and another warrior, Danan, was called. His quest is to locate the three sacred objects that Aganan used to defeat Gilbas: \"The Orb of Light\", \"The Amulet of Light\", and \"The Knife of Light\". </p>\n<p>There are about four rounds to complete, and has Danan going through exotic locations defeating enemies such as valkyries, ogres, bees, spiders, and several others. At the end of each round, you come face to face with a boss, which takes quite a number of hits to kill with your sword. Once they are defeated, they are likely to give you one of the objects that you need to defeat Gilbas. More to the story is then revealed.</p>\n<p>Assisting you with your journey are three animals: an eagle, a monkey, and some other animal that I am unfamiliar with. To get these animals to help you, however, you will need to collect three of their tokens that are found in yellow chests. These animals are quite useful in dangerous situations. The eagle, for example, can get a hold of you and fly you to safety if more than one type of enemy surrounds you. Anyway, you can get these animals to help you at any place, at any time, as long as you have three of its tokens. Yellow chests can also reveal extra strength, extra time, or extra health.</p>\n<p>The game ends when you run out of time, or when you lose your health, and there are no second chances, unless you manage to find some elixirs, which are rare. </p>",

Gyokuro, an evil emperor, gained power and his oppressive rule caused great hardship to the people, and the princess who opposed him was confined to a dungeon somewhere in the Ohkami castle. Gyokuro has the Ohkami ninja under control at his command. Utilizing various ninjitsu techniques, in addition to the one that transforms them into a wolf, they protect him from the people who are his enemies.</p>\n<p>You play Kazamuru, a great warrior who challenges the clan to a fight in order to rescue the princess. However, he can't rescue the princess unless he finds the five scrolls in the thirteen areas of Ohkami. On his quest, he must defeat various ninjas such as Kuno-ichi and Ninniku, as well as fire-blowing ninjas, slashing ninjas, and footloose ninjas. You'll explore grassy fields, shrines, river banks,  towns, and the castle itself. Some of the steps have varied gameplay. For example, you must avoid boulders in Step 2, must use logs in order to cross a river in Step 5, avoid being trampled on by horses in Step 7, and scale a cliff in Step 9.</p>",

Whatever the future held would forge him as certain as fire forges a strong sword.</p>\n<p>The game takes place in two adventure formats: action and adventure scenes. In the action scenes, you take on a horde of enemies as you make your way toward the temple, being careful not to use up all your strength. Some of the enemies will drop one of two spheres: a blue sphere that, when collected, increases your strength; and an orange sphere that increases your energy. More often than not, there will be a boss waiting inside the temple, and you have to defeat them to continue with your journey. When you defeat them, a giant blue ball will be dropped, and that will give you maximum strength.</p>\n<p>The adventure scenes allow you to select a series of commands that allow you to travel to new locations, talk to characters, look at various objects, take items, and use existing items. When you decide to look, you can either look at the terrain, or some other object. When you decide to look at any object, a pointing finger will allow you to highlight the object which you are interested in. You can also use various spells throughout the game, which can be used to defeat someone, help them. But they can be used to help you instead. These spells include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HAKUJI - Focuses your \"Ki\" energy into a beam of destructive light!</li>\n<li>INDRA - Calls on the Thunder God to storm lightning on your enemies.</li>\n<li>FUDO - Calls forth a great ball of fire!</li>\n<li>KANNON - A kinder spell that returns the walking dead to the underworld. But it is not effective against all evil spirits.</li>\n<li>MARS - Calls on the God of War to restore your strength.</li>\n<li>HATTEN - Calls on the God of Winds to send a tornado or high winds against your enemies.</li>\n<li>MAKIRI - Gives you the power to fly!</li>\n<li>NOBOTA - Creates a shield impervious to all the enemy's missile at.</li>\n<li>PASSWORD - Allows you to password a point in the game, so that you can resume at that point later.</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p>It is the year 2242. You are Paladin, the galaxy's toughest bounty hunter. Cyborgs are about to take complete control of the universe under the direction of Vipron, their evil leader. You are sent to the cyborg fortress to get rid of all the chief cyborgs in each of the seven areas. </p>\n<p>The game screen is divided into three sections. This includes a first-person view of the map, in which you can see objects that are coming your way. There are two types of objects: red objects indicate the lower cyborgs, while white ones indicate the chief cyborgs. Next to it is a map of the area, your life and psycho power count. Below these is the action screen. </p>\n<p>In each of these seven areas, there are several floors which can be reached via the elevator. At the beginning of the game, your only weapons are your fists, but weapons can be collected throughout each area, which include psycho punch, ray gun, light gun, and bombs. Power-ups like extra life and psycho power can also be collected. If you use the psycho punch or psycho gun, your psycho power gets depleted, and when it is empty, you must stock up on some more. You can also get shields that will protect you from laser beams, and jet engines so that you can fly over hazards.\nIn some areas, you defeat a boss which leaves an ID card, which you can use to access other areas of the fortress. </p>\n<p>Some chief cyborgs are easy to kill, while some are hard. You will just have to work out which weapon works best with them. The game ends when you lose all your life. </p>\n<p>You are not alone in this mission. You also have Adina, your contact back at headquarters. Follow her instructions carefully and you may survive.</p>\n<p><em>Cyborg Hunter</em> is based on the Japanese-only animated TV series <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Ch%C5%8Donsenshi+Borgman\">Borgman</a>.</p>",

Sent from a distant outpost at the extreme edge of the Planetary System, the garbled message told of a new, gigantic Norsa Battle Fortress at the edge of the Norsa Galaxy.</p>\n<p>Apple and Champ, two members of the elite White Knight special peacekeeping force, immediately set out on a reconnaissance mission to investigate the Norsa Fortress.</p>\n<p>The last words which anybody heard from Apple and Champ were: \"Help us J.J.! Baron Ricks has...\"</p>\n<p>There are eight rounds in the game, and the gameplay is split into two parts. In the odd-numbered rounds, you ride a bike known as the \"Tri Formation\" which has the Zillion laser beam attached to it. As well as shooting Norsa warriors, you must jump over gaps and the pulsating areas of the floor. If your character comes in contact with their shots, or rides over the pulsating areas of the floor, your life meter will decrease. If that meter is empty, you lose a life. Power-ups can be obtained that will give you the Armorator or extra life. In Rounds 5 and 7, you are required to use the Armorator to survive the round. You can also change between Apple and Champ during these rounds, but only once each.</p>\n<p>And on the even-numbered rounds, you run-and-shoot your way to a boss. Beware of the Norsa Warriors and other enemies. The same rules apply to those of the odd-numbered rounds, where being shot at or fall in a gap will result in you losing a life. </p>",

Each of the levels are side-scrolling, with bamboo houses or dark, haunted caves as their backdrop. These levels see Hayato beseigned by ghosts, skeletons, and other spirits of the supernatural. On his side is his curved sword, which he can swish at will against the monsters. If Hayato comes in contact with a monster, he will lose some life.</p>\n<p>At the end of each level, you will have to fight a warlock or one of their henchmen. More often than not, there is a hut with a sealed door, but the door is not unlocked unless a warlock or henceman is defeated. You gain a new special power whenever you recover a scroll from them. These special powers range from high jumping to the ability to whirl your sword around like a windmill.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Golden Axe Warrior</em> is a spin-off of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/1199/golden-axe-series/\">Golden Axe games</a>, a series of side-scrolling Beat'Em Ups from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Sega\">Sega</a>.</p>\n<p>In ancient times a horde of giants rebelled against the elders and a brutal war ensued. Things looked grave until finally a hero, carrying the Golden Axe, appeared and drove back the giants. Since then, the kingdom of Firewood has been ruled by a family that had mastered the power of the nine crystals to ward off all evil from Firewood. Everyone lived in peace until one of Firewood's ministers betrayed his king and sold the nine crystals to Death Adder, one of the evil giants. Death Adder has hidden the nine crystals in nine dungeons, has unleashed hordes of monsters and is threatening to take over the world. Will there be another hero who can find the Golden Axe and defeat Death Adder?</p>\n<p>Gameplay in <em>Golden Axe Warrior</em> is very similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3393/the-legend-of-zelda/\">The Legend Of Zelda</a>, meaning you will spend most of your time exploring the large overworld fighting against lots of enemies and looking for the dungeons in which the crystals are hidden. Inside the dungeons you have to fight more enemies, find treasures and keys, solve simple puzzles and defeat the dungeon's boss to get one of the crystals. In order to survive against the large number of enemies, you will be able to find many different weapons and three different spells.</p>",

You just have to shoot your way on three planets (you have to travel through space first), blasting as many enemies as possible. Along the way, there are several bosses that you have to defeat. The later ones drop a power-up, which you can use to upgrade your ship. Some of the power-ups include double shots and laser beams. Another power-up gives you the ability to have an extra ship on your side and will join the fight, and will later serve as a backup. <em>Blade Eagle</em> is designed for play in conjunction with the Sega 3-D Glasses. If you play without the 3-D glasses, it will look like as if there are two of your ships, not just one. If there are four enemies approaching you, they will look like eight.</p>",

The words \"Cyber Zeed\" was always written at the scene of the crime. Later, the world realized what Cyber Zeed had planned to do: use their nuclear capabilities to terrorize the world. Every nation sent their best forces to stop this threat, but all of them failed. </p>\n<p>Joe Musashi came forward to this great evil, and he is required to fight those who rose from the ashes and put an end to this threat.</p>\n<p><em>Cyber Shinobi</em> is a one-player game that consists of six rounds. You need to fight ninjas that get in your way using your fists and legs. You can also defeat them using special attacks and ninjitsu. Power-ups can be collected along the way, which will give you more shots, ninjitsu, power, and life. A boss needs to be defeated at the end of the round.</p>",

The odd-numbered stages require you to shoot gunslingers that hang out at saloons, hotels, and towns. When a gunslinger threatens you with a gun, you have only seconds to shoot him before you lose some life.  If this happens, you can increase your life meter if you shoot barrels that are scattered across town, and then detonating the bomb that is revealed, wiping out gunslingers in sight. You must be careful not to shoot innocent civilians or gunslingers who surrender, or you also lose life. At the end of these rounds, the leader will come out of a building and will move side-to-side, occasionally shooting you if he has the chance.</p>\n<p>In the even-numbered stages (except stage six), you are required to ride across a desert, shooting gunslingers that ride past you. You can increase life by shooting the only gunslinger not on a horse and then detonating the bomb that is revealed. At the end of these levels, you will be faced with a challenging stage, where the object is to shoot as many targets as you can before time runs out.</p>",

Guide Catherine through seven chapters, using either the joypad or Light Phaser to shoot ghosts that haunt her. You can also use special attacks to defeat a group of ghosts. More often than not, there will be a boss that you need to defeat in order to continue the game. If you get hit by a ghost, you will start to lose life. If your life meter is empty, the game ends. In each chapter, you can shoot cracked walls, graves, and broken windows to get extra life or special attacks.</p>\n<p><em>Laser Ghost</em> for the Master System is completely different from the original arcade game with the same name.</p>",

To do this, you must go out at sea with a submarine and destroy several enemy targets. Once you have defeated each enemy target, the mission is completed, and, upon completing some of them, your rank increases. Before defeating each target, however, you also need to destroy enemy jets, choppers, and submarines who will launch missiles or rockets at you. If you are hit by any of these, damage is inflicted to the submarine, but you can shoot down any of the missiles or rockets. You will need to keep an eye on the built-in radar and sonar to find out where enemies will hit next. Your fuel is limited, and can be increased by destroying certain enemies. The game ends when your submarine is destroyed or you run out of fuel.</p>",

You have 3 chances to save each city.  Scene 1: Launch.  Shoot as many as possible from their launch point.  If you miss any, you can catch up with them in scene 2.  Scene 2: However many you missed in the previous scene, you have another chance to shoot them down.  If you miss them again, you have one final chance to catch them in scene 3.  Scene 3: The City - This is the last chance.  You must shoot them ALL down, if even one gets through, the game is over.  The game starts off fairly easy, but quickly ramps up in speed and the number of missiles launched.</p>",

Not only do you have to worry about the enemy, your fuel is working against you as well. The second part of the battle is to grab fuel and take out ground forces through a 3D corridor and dodging walls. The final part of the battle is the end boss.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the latter half of the 21st century, robots have been engaged in labor in dangerous places, housework, etc. Then suddenly, the control system used to function these robots plotted a revolt against the human race, and ordered every robot to annihilate all of the people. The robots robbed them of their weapons, and occupied various military bases and factories. The war robots that were manufactured there murdered men one after another, and the survivors organized a resistance and went into a full-scale offensive against the enemy's army. You are Joe, and you swear that nothing can stop you from destroying the control system which forces the robots to kill.</p>\n<p><em>Assault City</em> is a one-player shooter. At the beginning of the game, you participate in a little shooting practice, where you must shoot squares that contains pictures of robots, and avoid shooting squares that contains pictures of humans. In the levels that follow the shooting range, you must kill robots that appear and attack you. If you are hit by these robots, some of your energy will be lost. Occasionally, shooting the power-ups that appear will result in more weapon power or more life. At the end of each level, you need to defeat a boss in order to proceed to the next level. The game ends when you lose all of your energy. You have unlimited continues, however.</p>\n<p><em>Assault City</em> comes in two flavors: the control pad version, as well as a Light Phaser version.</p>",

Upon serving, the screen switches to a side-view and you have to time the throw and the hit to perform a succesful serve.</p>\n<p>The in-game progress can be saved with a password function.</p>",

The heroes can jump, punch, swim, throw obstacles, grab vines or ropes and they have distinct moves. Obelix moves slower, but is able to manipulate objects, while Asterix has much more speed. Both characters can be played alternately according to the level. In the two-player mode, you each choose a character and clear areas in turns.</p>\n<p>Aside from the traditional moves, there are special potions that melt ice, create makeshift bridges or blow up blocks.

If she fails, she'll be turned into a dirty monster and the world will be polluted for ever!</p>\n<p>M\u00f4nica no Castelo do Drag\u00e3o (which translates \"M\u00f4nica in the Dragon's Castle\") is a modified version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/12588/wonder-boy-in-monster-land/\">Wonder Boy in Monster Land</a>, with Wonder Boy's hero, Tom-Tom, replaced by M\u00f4nica, a famous Brazilian comic character. M\u00f4nica is this little, chubby, toothy and extremely strong girl, who beats up any of the neighborhood boys who dare to mess with her. She's always carrying her stuffed rabbit named Sans\u00e3o, which is in fact her strongest weapon.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is pretty much the same in Wonder Boy in Monster Land, with M\u00f4nica side scrolling through twelve locations. She can brandish Sans\u00e3o against her enemies by pressing button 1. Through her way, M\u00f4nica must defeat monsters who will leave gold when defeated. With that money, M\u00f4nica will be able to buy new equipment (in proper stores), such as boots, shields, dresses and stuffed rabbits. By pressing button 2, M\u00f4nica can jump; jumping at certain places several times will reveal hidden items. The PAUSE button will display the statistics screen, with the amount of life and gold M\u00f4nica's carrying, as well as special items and equipment. M\u00f4nica will also usually find, at the end of each location, bosses who will drop lots of gold and a key to unlock the exit. The levels have a time limit, and M\u00f4nica needs to find hourglasses that will appear out of nowhere in order to replenish her hourglass, thus avoiding losing health. She can heal herself by buying juice or vitamin drinks at bars, or going into hospitals.</p>\n<p>All the text in the game (dialog, items' names) is in Portuguese, except for the life and gold meters and the round end screens (which are still in English).</p>",

In order to regain his original human form, he would have to find the Salamander Cross. Through his way, he would find Dragons which, when defeated, would curse Tom-Tom again, turning him into other animal forms. In <em>Turma da M\u00f4nica em: O Resgate</em>, when M\u00f4nica disappears, Chico Bento (Lizard-Man in <em>Wonder Boy III</em>) shows up and starts the gang's quest. After defeating each dragon, a new friend takes place in the quest. The other friends are Bidu (formerly Mouse-Man), Cebolinha (formerly Piranha-Man), Magali (formerly Lion-Man) and Anjinho (formerly Hawk-Man).</p>\n<p>Each of M\u00f4nica's friends has different abilities and weapons, such as:* Chico Bento - Shotgun</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bidu - Bone and shield, can walk on walls</li>\n<li>Cebolinha - Sword and shield</li>\n<li>Magali - Rolling pin, attacks by swinging it in an arc.</li>\n<li>Anjinho - Fire sword and shield, flies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other characters from the comic books also appear in this game, such as Casc\u00e3o (as the shop keeper), Franjinha (as the Doctor) and the great villain, Capit\u00e3o Feio (formerly Vampire Dragon).</p>\n<p>M\u00f4nica's friends can side-scroll to any place of Terra dos Monstros (Monster Land), but some places will be reachable only by a certain member of the gang, due to their specific abilities or weapons. They can attack (button <strong>1</strong>) or jump (button <strong>2</strong>), and you can access their statistics screen by pressing the <strong>PAUSE</strong> button. There you can equip items and weapons, as well as special attacks, such as fire balls, tornadoes, arrows, boomerangs and thunder strikes (all released by pressing <strong>down</strong> and <strong>2</strong> together). Enemies defeated will drop gold and keys, allowing access to new areas. Collecting stones will raise the characters' Charisma, bettering the odds of getting items and gold. At each town you reach you'll receive a password, allowing you to continue the game from that point.</p>\n<p>All the text in game is in Portuguese.</p>",

Chapolim is a parody to superheroes in general. He dresses a red grasshopper costume with a yellow heart in the chest with the leters \"CH\". He also usually carries his Marreta Bi\u00f4nica (Chipote Chill\u00f3n in the original, Squeaky Mallet in English) a red (toy) hammer.</p>\n<p>At each stage, Chapolim must defeat five vampires that are in torpor within their coffins. The coffins are locked, so he must first find the keys to unlock them. He'll find the keys killing the most diverse enemies that haunt the mansion he's in, such as ghosts, bats, fire blowers, mummies, etc. Once he's got a key, he must unlock a coffin and then defeat the vampire who sleeps there.</p>\n<p>In order to kill his enemies, Chapolim can jump over them or punch them. Every once in a while, his Marreta Bi\u00f4nica will come flying from one side of the screen to another, and if he jumps over it, he'll catch it. Chapolim can also punch the lights of the mansion: they'll flash and paralyze his enemies.</p>\n<p>Chapolim starts with 3 lives and no continues. He'll be healed by collecting treasures through the castle, and will gain additional lives at every 50,000 and 150,000 points.</p>\n<p>All the text in the game is in Portuguese.</p>",

Before going to her house, you decide to buy a present for her. You visit a shady foreign man's shop and buy an egg that he promises will hatch a cute pet. When Laila sees the egg, she recognizes it as a Mio egg, Mios being a rare animal that is thought to be extinct. Since you gave her the egg, it is your responsibility to find out how you keep a Mio. Still, the fact that you have a Mio egg should not be known to everyone, since scientists will be very keen to take the animal from you for purposes of their studies.</p>\n<p>Your quest for the well-being, and eventual mystery, of the Mio animal takes you on a quest across several planets, not too far from the planet system of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8194/phantasy-star/\">Phantasy Star</a>. The game is controlled using an interface popular in Japanese adventures of the eighties, mostly identical with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/330/rabid-entertainment-inc/\">ICOM's</a> interface used in adventures from the same era, such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Shadowgate\">Shadowgate</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Deja+Vu:+A+Nightmare+Comes+True\">D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu</a>. You can talk to people in the game by deciding whom to talk to and the topic, but these interrogations have little in common with the more interactive <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=SCUMM+Engine+games\">LucasArts adventures</a>. Finding out things is often a matter of repeatedly asking, asking at the right moment or in the right order. Battery-backed up RAM is not used for saving, instead you are given a password when quitting.</p>",

There is also a significantly better graphics and the Beach was restored to the first stage and sluggish Rock Tunnel stage (whose graphics made crippling demands on almost all the home gaming platforms) was replaced by a dark road tunnel instead.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The merciless Sapo Boi, with the help of the evil Lagart\u00e3o and Sibila, the sorceress snake, recruited an army of monsters to take over the swamp and enslave its inhabitants. He also kidnapped R\u00e3zinha, Sapo Xul\u00e9's girlfriend, to make her his princess. Now, Sapo Xul\u00e9, along with his three friends (Ratopulga, Porcopum and Tartafede) must to stop the cruel tyrant.</p>\n<p><em>Sapo Xul\u00e9 vs. Os Invasores do Brejo</em> (which translates Sapo Xul\u00e9 vs. The Swamp Invaders) is a modified version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9002/psycho-fox/\">Psycho Fox</a>, with its main character replaced by Sapo Xul\u00e9, a character based on a popular toy in Brazil back in the '80s; a toad with shoes which, when taken off, release a really bad smell.</p>\n<p>In <em>Psycho Fox</em>, the player could also play as three other characters during the game: Hippo, Monkey Boy and Leopard. In <em>Sapo Xul\u00e9 vs. Os Invasores do Brejo</em>, they were replaced by Porcopum (a pig), Ratopulga (a mouse) and Tartafede (a turtle).</p>\n<p>Each character has its own special ability: Porcopum can break rock walls (but he's considerably slower than the others). Ratopulga can jump higher than any other character, while Tartafede is the fastest one. Sapo Xul\u00e9 is the most balanced of them.</p>\n<p>In this side-scrolling/platform game, all characters can kill their enemies by punching or jumping on top of them, until they are completely buried. If they are not buried completely, the enemies will pop out of the ground and come after the character again. Besides the monsters, other common obstacles are spikes, cannonballs, fireballs, pits and more.</p>\n<p>The characters can also find Sapo Xul\u00e9's stinky shoes, which can be used as a boomerang-like weapon. If they are hit when carrying the shoe, they'll just lose it instead of dying.</p>\n<p>To switch among the characters, the player must find green potions, usually hidden inside eggs, or carried by enemies. Other special items can be collected, such as \"invincibility flies\", Sapo Xul\u00e9's stinky socks (which kill every enemy on the screen) and some white bags, which are meant to be used at the bonus stages.</p>\n<p>The bonus stages consist of labyrinths with several paths, each leading to prizes or nothing at all. Each white bag collected at the main stages give the player an extra character to set up for a different path at the labyrinth, raising the chances of reaching a prize in the end.</p>\n<p>Apart from changes in the main characters, some enemy sprites were replaced, such as the first boss - which came to be Sibila, the sorceress snake - and obviously the last one - which came to be Sapo Boi.</p>",

There are also satellite weapons that can be attached to the ship.</p>\n<p>The game consists in three levels, at the end of which Sapo Xul\u00e9 must destroy one scientist's submarine. Once all the three scientists are defeated, they are revived and Sapo Xul\u00e9 is sent back where he started, in a never-ending circle.</p>",

Naja hypnotized an army of fighters, witches, zombies and even toads to fight for him. But he didn't know that among the toads he hypnotized was Sapo Chi-Ling, a great kung fu fighter, Sapo Xul\u00e9's master. Once Sapo Xul\u00e9 knew it, he left the swamp and went to Japan to fight Naja and his gang, and free his master.</p>\n<p><em>Sapo Xul\u00e9: O Mestre do Kung Fu</em> (which means Sapo Xul\u00e9: the Master of Kung Fu) is a modified version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/13374/kung-fu-kid/\">Kung Fu Kid</a>, with its main character replaced by Sapo Xul\u00e9, a character based on a popular toy in Brazil back in the 80's: a toad with shoes which, when taken off, release a really bad smell.</p>\n<p>In this side-scrolling/platform game, Sapo Xul\u00e9 will fight his enemies kicking (button 1) and jumping (button 2) along seven rounds, fighting a boss at the end of each round, except for round six, which has several bosses to fight. From time to time shurikens will appear; by shooting them (pressing up and button 1), Sapo Xul\u00e9 can clear the way in front of him. Some enemies will try to hold Sapo Xul\u00e9: to release himself he'll have to move fast.</p>\n<p>All rounds have a 99 seconds time limit. Sapo Xul\u00e9 starts with 3 lives and no continues.</p>",

The enemies will come out of dice-faced boxes, and there will be as much enemies as shown at the box face. Once they are shot, they are turned into little balls, which must be quickly collected. If they're are not collected in a short period of time, they will turn into little creatures which will steal away time. Once all enemies are defeated, Geraldinho will proceed to the next level.</p>\n<p>If Geraldinho stands for too long on a platform, it will disintegrate, causing him to fall to the platform below. Sometimes this is the only way to get out of some closed places.</p>\n<p>From time to time Geraldinho will also play a bonus game, in which he must shoot boxes to get objects inside them.

There are two reasons for him to fight alone: the first is that the C.I.A. doesn't want to stir up a war, and the second is simply because this is Rambo! The mission is to rescue Rambo's comrade Colonel Trautman from the Soviets. He was taken in as prisoner while he was delivering weapons to the Mujahedin freedom fighters and is being held captive in a prison camp. </p>\n<p>An AK-47 and grenades are the only weapons available. Additional grenades can be picked up by blasting open containers such as pots and crates. The goal is simple: eliminate all the enemies that appear on screen to reach the next stage!</p>\n<p>The first stage is a Soviet army base packed full of soldiers. The next stage is a village where the Soviets are hiding. Then the rest of the levels are the mountains, the prison camp, the Soviet camp (night escape), the cave attack, then the final stage with the face-off between Rambo and the Mil Hind helicopter.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Play as Rocky Balboa, the \"Italian Stallion\" in this boxing game. You confront opponents in a specific order, from Apollo the remaining champion, to Lang an aggressive contender, to Drago the Soviet boxer who trains constantly. Before you have a fight, just like in the \"Rocky\" movies, you have to train. Practice your timing and punching strength with some sandbag punching before fighting Apollo.  Warm up punching a punching ball to become more faster and smarter to get ready for Lang. Then you will do some punching mitts training before fighting Drago where you watch the mitts and punch at the as they move. All of these trainings have qualifications such as punches per second, qualify and your combinations get better for the following fight. </p>\n<p>During a fight you only have one meter under your name, that is the power meter. Your opponent has one likewise. Watching your power bar can tell you a lot about which way the fight is headed, either it's full and you can take more punches and punch more powerfully or it's low and you're in  trouble. Watching the opponents power bar will tell you when to take him down or when to block.</p>\n<p>Between rounds you get a chance to freshen up and get some last minute coaching. During the one minute interval, your power will go up only half of what has been drained. </p>\n<p>If you do happen to take a fall the controls are similar to Nintendos \"Punch out\", basically you just press the 1 and 2 buttons as fast as possible. Hopefully Rocky stands up and is ready for more.</p>",

You are a pilot of a helicopter and the object is to rescue hostages without being shot down by soldiers, jeeps, tanks, choppers, and ground-based missiles, and bring them back to base. A maximum of four hostages can fit into the helicopter at any given time, so it is necessary to make more than one trip. You can choose from a variety of weapons that you can use to shoot down enemies. There are five rounds, which take you through theme parks, burning skyscrapers, army bases, sunken submarines, and caverns. The round ends when you have taken the required number of hostages to the bases.</p>",

Although the main setting of each level is the same to both characters (forests, caves, deserts, underwater stages, waterfalls and such) the level design for each one may vary. In two player mode, players will take turns playing as Gilmar and Priscila. Both characters jump (by pressing button 2), punch enemies and break blocks (by pressing button 1). Gilmar can run can run (by pressing and holding button 1 while moving) and double jump (by pressing 2 in the middle of a jump). Priscila is stronger and can break several bricks in a row when jumping over them (pressing 1 while jumping), and can also slide down hills (by pressing down at them).</p>\n<p>Gilmar can get some potions (thrown by pressing up and 1), which can break rocks, kill or shrink enemies. Priscila can get miniature menhirs which can be thrown (by pressing up and 1) against enemies. Both characters can also get bones throughout the game, granting access to bonus stages where the player controls a little dog. Some levels also involve minor puzzle solving, like pushing switches or moving rock blocks.</p>",

If the player scores less the specified amount, he loses. In the \"catch the object\" and shooter games (1, 2, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16 and 17), points are earned by catching or shooting objects. In racing games (3, 7, 8, 9, 14, 18 and 19), points are earned by the distance ran. In game 15 points are earned by hitting the oven; in game 20, by number of hits in the ball. In these games (15 and 20), the player can loose if he misses all his balls/pizzas. In game 4 no points are earned at all, and you'll loose if the character gets stuck and the screen scrolls over him.</p>\n<p>The game has only two songs, one played at the title screen, the other played during all gameplay. All the text in the game is in Portuguese.</p>",

Four of its six events were removed and now the player can only compete in the Surfing and BMX events. The team selection (sponsorship) was also removed, as well as the ability to name the players. Each player will get a default name (PLAY1, for instance), and the game will select teams in order (player 1 gets Maxx-Out, player 2 gets Costa del Mar, and so on). The trophy screens were also removed, so the player doesn't see the team logo on them. Players only know which team they are assigned to during the event competition when their names and team names appear on the top of the screen.</p>\n<p>Up to eight players can take turns competing in either one of the two events, or both. They can also choose to practice in one single event. </p>\n<p>In the Surfing event, players must perform maneuvers on the wave as trying to keep as long as possible inside the tube, or jumping off and on the wave. The board's speed can be brought up by climbing and descending the wave, and be slowed down by holding button 2 while maneuvering. When the time runs out, the judges will tell the score.</p>\n<p>In the BMX event, players must perform jumps and maneuvers while trying to complete the course. The bike is accelerated by pressing button 1 repeatedly and jumps can be performed by pressing button 2. While in the middle of a jump, pressing different directions on the d-pad will make the biker perform different kinds of jumps. The more dangerous the maneuver, the more points are awarded. If bikers crash three times, they are eliminated.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Tia Nast\u00e1cia (Aunt Anastacia) is sick, and Dr. Caramujo (Dr. Snails) is called to examine her. And he's got some good and bad news. Good news is that she can be cured. Bad news is that, to prepare the medicine, he'll need five rare ingredients: bat's blood, Saci's hat, Curupira's salsaparrilha bat, Iara's hair and a tear from Cuca. To make things even worse, next night will be a full moon, and if Tia Nast\u00e1cia doesn't get cured until then, she'll sleep for 100 years! So, Pedrinho (Pete) and Em\u00edlia (Emily) are sent to bring the ingredients and cure Tia Nast\u00e1cia.</p>\n<p><em>S\u00edtio do Picapau Amarelo</em> (Yellow Woodpecker Ranch in English) is based on the works of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Monteiro+Lobato\">Monteiro Lobato</a>, a Brazilian writer. One or two players (in hot-seat mode) can choose to play either the boy Pedrinho (or Pete, in the English version of the books) or the rag doll Em\u00edlia (Emily in the English version). The items they must gather are based on Brazilian folklore.</p>\n<p>Gameplay consists in basic side-scrolling/platforming. Either characters can jump (button 2), run (either pressing the D-pad twice to a direction, or holding a button and the D-pad to a direction), shoot (button 1), and duck. The game has four levels (one for each ingredient, the last one with two of them), all set in the ranch, with indoor levels, underwater levels, caves and such.</p>\n<p>Each character starts with 3 lives. They have a health bar, which can be replenished by gathering items such as nests with eggs, or by freeing birds from cages. The enemies faced are most animals, such as bats, bugs, spiders, snakes, piranhas, jaguars and monkeys.</p>\n<p>All in game text is in Portuguese.</p>",

Not thinking twice, he drank it, only to discover it was one of Dr. Vitor's potions, which turned him into a baby! Now Pedro and Biba must find 4 ingredients to make an antidote to the potion.</p>\n<p><em>Castelo R\u00e1-Tim-Bum</em> (Ra-Tim-Bum Castle) is an action/adventure game based on a quite popular educative Brazilian TV series, produced during the mid 90's but aired as late as 2007. The player can chose to play either Pedro or Biba to search for the ingredients through five levels. The main difference between the two is that Biba is a little faster than Pedro.</p>\n<p>Each level involves some platforming and minor puzzle solving elements, like jumping over the right sequence of platforms, or finding food inside the kitchen's drawers in the right order. To enter each level, the player must choose the right door, based on the doorkeeper's clues.</p>\n<p>The player has three lives and a health bar, and continues are available. All the text in game is in Portuguese.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>James 'Buster' Douglas Knockout Boxing</em> is a boxing simulation featuring the former world heavyweight boxing champion (replaced with the fictional S. Davis in the European version). The game is not to be confused with the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/21346/final-blow/\">Genesis title</a> of the same name, which is an entirely different game. Instead this title is completely identical to the Game Gear and Master System versions of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=George+Foreman's+KO+Boxing\">George Foreman's KO Boxing</a>, to which it served as a basis, only with George Foreman instead of James Douglas and reworked by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/3403/sims-co-ltd/\">Sims Co., Ltd.</a>, a spin-off of the original Sanritsu team.</p>\n<p>The player is cast as James Douglas to go through a series of boxing matches against different opponents to win the championship title belt. The boxers are shown from the side. Players can move left or right in the ring to avoid punches. Other moves including blocking, and left and right punches that can be varied into jabs and crosses. Matches can last up to ten rounds and when no regular or technical knock-out occurs, the winner is based on the jury's points, provided between the rounds. During knock-out phases, no buttons need to be pressed to get the boxer back to his feet. At the start of the game, a slow or fast speed for the gameplay can be selected.</p>\n<p>Each match the player's boxer can use three super punches. These need to be charged and then unleashed when near an opponent. It sends them straight to the back of the ring, a dangerous area as it is easy to keep punching them into the ropes. Health is slightly restored during the intermission and after each won match the player is awarded skill points to be distributed over three characteristics. Matches for two players are supported.</p>",

The game takes the players through six levels controlling Jack in an armoured jeep. The gameplay is shown through a top-down perspective, with the screen scrolling vertically at a constant rate. The jeep cannot access the top part of the screen, only two thirds of it and getting stuck behind certain objects blows up the jeep.</p>\n<p>The jeep is equipped with an unlimited amount of bullets and about 50 missiles per mission. Certain objects in the air can only be taken out using missiles. After launching them, players can apply \"aftertouch\" to guide towards the target by moving left or right. The settings, including a factory and a jungle, sometimes have obstacles, also requiring the jeep to jump over rivers. There are three difficulty levels, the vehicle can take multiple hits and there are three lives per continue.</p>",

The other two modes can be played against computer or a human opponent as well. </p>\n<p>You can choose Major League Baseball teams in all of those modes. During the game, the player controls the pitcher and the batter from a third-person view; the view changes to top-down after a strike by a batter, so that the player can view a large part of the field.

The player can choose from running and passing plays to field goals and punting plays when the time is right.</p>\n<p>In a one-player game, the player only competes on offense. The game starts out with the CPU ahead in score and the player must try to score enough points to win. The CPU will automatically kick-off after a possession is over, there is no defense to be played. In a two-player game, there is both offense and defense to be played. One must try to do whatever possible to win, whether it be through touchdowns and field goals on offense or interceptions and safeties on defense.</p>",

There are 11 difficulty modes: beginner, novice, amateur, intermediate, professional, chess champion, grand chess champion, chess master, grand chess master, adaptive (which tries to adapt to the player's skill) and infinite think mode. The game also offers a problem solving mode.</p>\n<p>Gameplay consists in moving a hand icon across the board selecting the piece to move and the target location. The player can ask for hint moves and when it is the computer's turn, he can force the opponent to move. The table side can also be flipped during the gameplay. The plays are recorded and the players can see it in the main menu screen.</p>\n<p>Players can also set up a game with a given set of pieces, provided there is at least one king to each side. Two players mode can be played with one or two controllers. The table can be viewed in a 2D or 3D view.</p>",

The two buttons on the controllers are use to hit straight and fast, and to lob. When close to the net, volleys and smashes are also possible. Multiplayer is supported for two players, head to head or in a doubles game with or against AI opponents.</p>",

It has the option to play the 24 most known countries to have played in the World Cup, each with players having there own skill levels based on the real teams. There are 3 more modes to chose from that includes Versus where the player can play against a friend, Exhibition where one the player picks a opponent to play a single match, and Watch where the player picks two CPU players to battle it out alone.</p>\n<p>When playing a game the player first picks the team they want to play (and there opponents team if in Exhibition mode) and the color of there jersey before the CPU picks a random jersey color for their team. Before the match starts the player can set up the formation of the team and can also set up who plays and their position, this menu can also be accessed when a goal is scored or the ball goes out. The players (that are all abbreviated to there initials) have stats for Power, Speed, and Technique. When the game starts the player is presented with a side on birds\u2019 eye view of the field. The player, when in control of the ball can pass the ball to the closest team mate or attempt for a goal. When defending the player can change the controlling player or do a slide tackle (slide tackle is the only tackle the player can do). There is no penalties in the game other then kicking the ball out. The game is fast paced as it is played in sped up mode to get a full game in a reduced time. There are 3 levels of difficulty and the default game length can be changed in the configuration. Password save after each match is available.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Casino Games</em> the player can visit a Casino with $500 in the pocket where they spend it on casino games. The games come in 3 different categories that include card game, slot machine, and pinball.</p>\n<p>After the player picks there gender and their surname they are greeted by the woman at the information desk.

The player can Hit (get another card) or Stand (keep the cards) . It uses the casino rules like Double Down (if the score lower then 12 then the player can double the bet but have a maximum of one more card), Split (turn two matching cards into 2 separate hands), and Insurance (player wins if the dealer gets 21 with two cards after playing extra). Bets can be between $10 and $100.</p>\n<p><em>Baccarat</em> \u2013 Player tries to beat the dealers score by using only the last digit of the total of the cards (i.e 10+4 = 4) if the score is under six then the player gets dealt one more card. If the players score is over six or seven then the dealer may get an extra card based on complex rules. Eight and above then no one gets an extra card. Bets can be between $10 and $100.</p>\n<p><strong>Slot Machine</strong>  </p>\n<p>There are old standard fruit slot machines with 3 lines each. The player picks a slot machine that come in $1, $5, $25, $50, or $100 per token. There is one token per line to a maximum of 3 lines after which the player will be increasing the payout per line up to 3 times (9 tokens max). The payouts range from 1 Cherry (2 tokens) to Lucky Sevens (50 tokens).</p>\n<p><strong>Pinball:</strong><br>\nAfter choosing the table slope of Gentle, Middle, or Steep (slow to fast) the player is presented with a standard 3 ball pinball table named CASINOGAMES with drop-targets, bumpers, rollovers, and 2 levels of flippers.

        "description": "<p><em>Golfamania</em> is a golfing simulation game where players play on an 18 hole golf course with all the rules and scoring like in the real game.</p>\n<p>Within the game there are 4 different modes to play on that includes Practice, Match Play, Stroke Play, and Pro Tournament. In Practice a single player can play any of the 18 holes available. Match Play is 2 player mode against human or computer. Stroke Play is the player can play up to 4 others that can include 1 computer player. In this mode the character skill can increase in 3 different areas that are power, accuracy, and luck with the 6 different characters available. The main mode is the Pro Tournament and it is where the player plays against over 30 computer players (all playing different holes) with the objective to score lower than the other players (as per the rules of golf). Based on performance the player can earn experience points (XP) that they can use to upgrade the power, accuracy, and luck of the character for future tournaments. Some of the holes have awards like \u2018longest drive\u2019 and \u2018hole in one\u2019 awards that can earn bonus XP. </p>\n<p>Regardless of the mode the game is played in the same sort of way. The player selects a character (the selection depends on the mode) and then sets up the character by naming and picking their style. In all modes but Practice the player must pick 3 golf clubs that they must remove from their selection of 17 different clubs (1-5 wood, 1-9 Iron, Pitching Wedge, Sand Wedge, and Putter). When playing the player is presented with a top down view where the player lines up the shot and the location on the golf ball they want to hit (for spin). Then the player selects the club they want to use (all go varying distances). When that is all done the player must play the skill part of the game, where they are presented with a power bar that has a marker that going is up and down along it. The player must stop the marker on the red area in the centre of the power bar to get a good hit (with the center been a perfect hit)and if this area is missed the ball will only travel about 20 yards (compared to about 100+ yards of a good hit). The amount of red that is on the power bar depends on the golf club used. To help the player the distance of the shot can be lowered in exchange for a lower marker speed and can be used for shots closer to the hole (very helpful for putter shots). The game uses battery backed RAM save to continue play later.</p>",

But then the captain had a strange dream, nightmare in fact, where he was playing basketball against all these strange creatures in exotic locations.</p>\n<p><em>Basketball Nightmare</em> is a basketball game where the player plays basketball against strange humanoid creatures on the court where the creature lives. The player must play and defeat each creature before moving onto a new place with a new harder opponent. The player starts of playing against Wolfs in the Forest and then, upon defeating that opponent, moves on to play Frogs at the Pond, One Eyed Aliens at the Waterfall, Vampires in the Skeleton Cave, Geishas in the Bamboo Forest, before finally playing against Samurais at the Shrine. If the player loses a match then that match can be replayed until won.</p>\n<p>The player at the start of each match gets to pick how long the match duration is out of the options of 15, 30, or 45 minutes (not in real time) before being placed on the court. When on the court the player always plays towards the right of the court. First the player tries to get the ball from a throw by a well timed button press. When the player has the ball the player has the option to move, pass the ball, and jump. When jumping the player can shoot, with the accuracy of the shot depending on the timing, or just simply pass. When defending the player can cycle through the field or just simply run into the opponent to challenge for the ball. There are a few penalties that the player can get including but not limited to Travelling (not passing after jumping), Charging (Sometimes called when the player with the ball runs into an opponent), and Pushing (Sometimes called when the player without the ball runs into an opponent) with all the penalties resulting with the other team getting the ball on the side of the court.</p>\n<p>Also there are two more modes called CPU vs CPU, where the player can get the CPU to play itself and Versus Play to play against a friend. In both modes the player or players pick one of the 8 nations that are USA, CBA, CHN, JPN, URS, DDR, CAN, and FRN all with a character representing a player of that nation. All the rules are the same as single player mode.</p>",

The player plays as Tom, a curious cat who will do anything to get his paws on that trouble-maker mouse, Jerry. Tom tries to catch Jerry as he runs through six different levels. Starting in the Kitchen, Jerry will lead Tom through the Garden, Down Town, the Forest, Rock Mountain, and finally ending up in the Nursery.</p>\n<p>Jerry will do anything he can to keep Tom from snagging him. Even if that means running through dangerous areas. Tom must try and dodge tail-scorching stoves, dropping flower pots, falling boulders, and even climb skyscrapers and swim underwater all while trying to nab that rascally rodent. Not only that, Jerry will also throw bombs and leave land mines in Tom's path.</p>\n<p>Be careful, if Jerry gets too far ahead and out of site, the game is lost. But, if Tom is able to get close enough, he can pounce on Jerry resulting in advancing to the next level. The next level can also be reached to by chasing Jerry to the end of the round where he will be cornered. There are also damage points that are taken away from Tom as he is hit by the number of dangerous environments around him. Too many hits will also result in a game over. It is just another hard days work for Tom the cat!</p>",

Like other versions, it is a side-scrolling platformer. While very similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/42827/batman-returns/\">Game Gear version</a>, the Master System version has slightly different levels and gameplay mechanics.</p>\n<p>Batman must move through five stages on his way to defeat the Penguin. These include the streets and rooftops of Gotham City, Max Shreck's department store, the sewers, and the Penguin's lair. For the first four levels, a route can be selected from two options, allowing for different paths through the game.</p>\n<p>Enemies standing in Batman's way can be defeated by throwing the Batarang at them. At the beginning, the weapon's range is very limited, but it can be expanded by collecting powerups. Other tools Batman can use are a grappling hook to pull himself up to higher levels or swing across dangerous areas, and his cape, which can be used as a parachute, for more control during falls.</p>\n<p>Unlike in the Game Gear version, there is no health bar: a single hit will kill Batman. To compensate, the game contains a generous amount of extra lives.</p>",

A single survivor tells Ryu in his last seconds that the Sacred Scroll of Bushido was stolen. With the power of the scroll its owner is mighty enough the gain control of the whole world. Thus Ryu swears to recapture the scroll and the avenge the annihilation of his clan.</p>\n<p>The game is sidescrolling platformer/ beat'em up title and incorporates most of the mechanics from the NES games: Ryu can jump and attack with his Dragon Sword. Furthermore, he can collect different kinds of Ninja Magic (which again vary form the powers in the NES games), from shuriken to fire wheels, which can only be used finitely many times, as the use up energy which again must be collected. However, instead of clinging to walls and climbing them, Ryu can push himself off the wall in this game, which must be applied for instance by jumping and forth between two close walls to get higher and higher.</p>\n<p>The goal of each level is simply to reach the end of the level before the time runs out. Each level is divided into several sections, and at the end of each level is a boss fight. After beating a boss, a cut scene is shown which continues the story about Ryu's quest for the Bushido scroll and his revenge.</p>",

They are divided into three pools with different skill levels and in single-player only matches between teams from the same pool can be played. The available playing options are exhibition matches or a tournament. Regarding gameplay, the player either controls the athlete with the puck or one from the defense (including the goalkeeper) and one button is used for passing and another for shooting. From time to time two athletes get in a fist fight and the loser has to visit the penalty box. Overall the graphics and gameplay are similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7223/blades-of-steel/\">Blades of Steel</a>.</p>",

The energy is also used for performing vibrating attacks and can be recharged by at Star Food vendors scattered in the levels.

Milk Co., who is responsible for fixing the milk pipeline underground all over the world. The goal of the game is thus to dig a tunnel down to the pipeline in each level.</p>\n<p>The levels are basically a pattern of coloured blocks which Digger must shovel away. He can dig away the block either right below or above him, or to the left or to the right. All blocks of the same colour which are either vertically or horizontally adjacent to the disappearing block will vanish also. As the levels progress, blocks will appear in more different colours, thus slowing things down. As there is a time limit given by draining milk meter (which can be refilled by finding bottle of milk), some methodical proceeding is required. Also, Digger can climb up only a height of one block, so falling down several blocks deep might trap him, as there are also blocks of steel or pipes which cannot be dug away. Further difficulty is added by randomly placed TNT, which will explode shortly after being dug out and destroy everything within a one block radius.</p>",

In this iteration Dooly has to travel to different time periods, defeating various unsympathetic characters from the cartoon on the way.</p>\n<p>Dooly can jump and uses various firearms with unlimited ammunition to dispose of enemies. In most stages he is restricted to one type of weapon. The goal of each stage is to obtain three keys.

Kim Doohan can punch and kick his enemies, or combining these moves with jumping. Like in most games of the kind, all the enemies must be eliminated before the hero can proceed.

In the original work Kkachi is a baseball player who opposes the dictatorial tendencies of the South Korean regimes of the 1980's. The game, however, is purely fantasy-based, and resembles <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8330/alex-kidd-in-miracle-world/\">Alex Kidd in Miracle World</a> in style and concept.</p>\n<p>Kkachi has to traverse side-scrolling or vertical platform stages, defeating regular enemies and bosses, and trying not to fall into bottomless pits. He can slap enemies or execute special moves, which require specific items to be collected. Money is represented by fruit, garlic and comparable items that are scattered through the stages, and can be used in shops.</p>\n<p>The player can choose between six initial stages, each requiring him to collect a key needed to unlock the next area. Each stage has difference thematics, including a graveyard, a futuristic facility, underwater passages, a shooting stage riding a vulture, and others.</p>",

The kid is armed with a club, which can be swapped for a more powerful hammer if the player collects a corresponding icon. The protagonist's health is measured in hearts; contact with an enemy or damage taken from their attacks reduces it by one, while falling into bottomless pits takes away a whole life. Health-refilling hearts as well as Life-1 items can also be collected in the stages. Moving and collapsing platforms, deadly spikes, and other hazards await the young adventurer. Each world is divided into three stages and a boss battle on a separate screen.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The fourth entry in Zemina's series of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=mario\">Super Mario</a> conversions contains, like its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/56792/super-boy-iii/\">predecessor</a>, its own levels. Most of the design ingredients are lifted straight from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Super+Mario+World\">Super Mario World</a>, with familiar stage themes and enemies. A few level design elements and some of the enemies, however, are original.</p>\n<p>Unlike <em>Super Mario World</em>, the stages are completely linear. There is no overworld, and the levels themselves contain no secrets or bonus areas. Like in the preceding games, it is impossible to enter pipes. There are also no boss battles or stage hierarchy; levels composed out of elements taken from ghost houses and castles of <em>Super Mario World</em> (ghosts, skeletons, fire creatures, etc.) are grouped together and eventually give way to another series of outdoor levels. </p>\n<p>As opposed to the previous games, the protagonist in <em>Super Boy 4</em> is not Mario, but a thinner white-skinned young man. Mario's mushrooms are replaced by milk, and the flower turns into a hand icon; this power-up, which allows the hero to throw little orbs at enemies, also makes his skin dark. There is no cape power-up and also no Yoshi (though the fruits he eats are still present); however, the invincibility power-up appears much more prominently than in Mario games.</p>",

The group consists of two people holding a jumping sheet, and a third fire fighter bouncing on the sheet to reach the building's inhabitants at the windows.</p>\n<p>The sheet can be moved left and right, and the jumper can enter a square with an open/smashed window for a few seconds. If there is a fire behind the window, it will be put out. If the room is empty, it will be searched, and to certain chance, an item will be dropped. If there are inhabitants in the room, the jumper will take one person with him, which will be rescued on reaching the sheet.</p>\n<p>The goal of each stage is to either rescue all inhabitants from the building, or put the fire out completely. You lose a life if the jumper hits the ground or his health is depleted. The latter happens when the fire spreads further in the building. If the fire reaches a room with inhabitants, one will panic and jump out of the window and needs to be caught with sheet. Otherwise, the person falls to his death.</p>\n<p>Several items will help you. A fire extinguisher refreshes your health, and a key will end the stage with success. A helicopter summons a flying ambulance. If the jumper holds on to it, the level is completed immediately and a bonus stage will be accessed.</p>",

Once in a while a spider will appear, which reflects both your and your foes' shots for some reason. There also pigs appearing frequently, which give away items like a smart bomb when shot. Another odd feature is that hit enemies will shrink and walk off to the lower end of the screen. If they come in contact with Joe, they will cling on to him. This slows him down and constrains his ability to jump, but the enemies will also serve as a bullet shield.</p>\n<p>Like many early arcade games, the game has no ending.

        "description": "<p><em>Super Racing</em> is a Formula 1 racing game. There are two main game modes: Real mode (with the engine sounds only) and BMG mode (with background music during the races).</p>\n<p>After selecting the main mode, the player must choose a constructor. There are 6 different constructors, all based on real ones (e.g. Willivms instead of Williams, McRalen instead of McLaren and Fellali instead of Ferrari). Each constructor has two drivers, with names also resembling real driver ones (A. Semma, N. Nansell and N. Puquet, to name a few), but the player character can be named any way the player wants. After choosing one constructor, the player must then choose a class: practice, beginner, average or expert. Practice class will enable the player to choose any of the 18 circuits available. The other three classes will present a fixed selection of courses to be raced, with varying difficulty and number of laps per race. For each race, players can select the type of car: for hi-speed circuits or for technical ones. This will affect the car handling and top speed. Before each race, a practice lap must be played to determine the player's starting position.</p>\n<p>The game is played from a top-down perspective. The car moves only in the vertical direction (from bottom to top), with turns being up to 45\u00b0 to the right or to the left (with 90\u00b0 turns when the car leaves a 45\u00b0 turn to enter another in the opposite direction). One button is used to accelerate, the other to change gears (low or high). Cars can take damage and the fuel supply is limited. Pit stops are required to fix car damage and to refuel.</p>",

The movement of tokens around the board is seen in a special animation which can be toggled off. Available options during a player's turn are selected from a menu.

The field is seen from a top-down view during the batting/pitching scenes. Once the ball is successfully hit by the batter, the screen changes to a more zoomed out view, during which players control the fielders and runners.</p>\n<p>Players have the option between a 1-player game against the CPU or a 2-player game. They have the choice to pick a team from a pool of six non-licensed teams. The third and last mode is a special homerun contest. In that mode the players compete to hit as many homeruns as possible in a given number of tries.</p>",

Players can customize a series of features for their characters. The player can edit names, change player tee (front, middle or back), rearrange the 14 clubs, and select a player level (novice, amateur or pro).</p>\n<p>The game is viewed from a top-down perspective. The speed and direction of the wind is shown on the top-left corner of the screen. Two small windows at the bottom of the screen show the player character and the field in front of the player. As the player changes the direction of the shot, new terrain is shown in the lower window. The ball trajectory is also shown in this lower window, and changing clubs show the different trajectories the ball will take. To shoot, players have to hold the button 2 to set the power and then release it in the right moment, as shown by two meters in the lower window.

The main difference is the interface: instead of navigating text menus, the player directly controls the detective through the side-scrolling cities. There are two landmarks to look out for: buildings (entering them allows to question people) and a phone booth to enter the suspect's characteristics (eye color is replaced with vehicle). If the player is on the correct track, the suspect may show up and take a shot - the player must jump over it in order to avoid losing time.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Moggy Master</em> is the third game in the <em>Moggy</em> series, following the ZX Spectrum titles <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/131433/moggy/\">Moggy</a> (2005) and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/131438/moggy-adventure/\">Moggy Adventure</a> (2010). The game re-uses the first title's story. The player controls the character Moggy who has to free his classmates who are under the spell of the evil sorcerer Hib\u00f6n. The wizard lured them away during a party and wants to use their bodies to expand his power. Moggy is the only one who is not under the influence. The game consists of several levels or fields filled with trapped classmates who have a pink colour.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is close to the original 2005 title as each level is set in a single-screen environment. Moggy needs to quickly collect his pink friends by moving over them, but because he is drunk the controls are not precise with a thrust-like mechanic with slow acceleration/deceleration and a curved trajectory. Meanwhile he also needs to avoid fluorescent green plants and creatures that roam the field in later stages. He has a small amount of lives and colliding with a plant or an enemy removes one. The game is over when all lives are lost but also when Moggy takes too much time to complete a level. No timer is shown, so the player has to guess if it is fast enough.</p>\n<p>The two-player mode is entirely new for the series, making it into a hectic, arcade-like party game. Both players control a character in the same field (Moggy and WAW) and compete against each other collecting the pink friends, bumping each other into hazards or out of the way. The player with the highest score wins the round and the same level progression as in the single-player levels is used. Each player has separate lives.</p>",

However, some distinct changes have been made. The level layouts have been changed and the game now features a flip screen instead of scrolling, which causes the enemies to always appear in the same location when entering a new location. The game is also now littered with hazardous tiles on the ground that will kill the player if they step on them and these tiles will fire the occasional shot that needs to be avoided. The tiles can only be temporarily disabled by shooting them. Unlike the arcade version the first player is always Ricky and the second player is always Mary and the players take turns instead of being able to play co-op.</p>",

The game also has hidden rooms which allows players to rack up bonus points and find items that are needed to see the best ending. The endings themselves have been changed to be a bit more cinematic.</p>\n<p>Super Bubble Bobble is a mode in the original version that happened after the player beat the original set of levels and had to beat them again with the enemies being swapped around. Beating this would allow the player to see the true ending. This version of the game lacks this mode as the 200 levels are considered one playthrough.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Home Alone</em> is a 2D-sidescrolling platformer based on the 1990 movie of the same name. The player takes control of Kevin McCallister, who is accidentally left behind by his family when they go off on holiday. During this time, the burglars Harry and Marv break in, and Kevin must foil them.</p>\n<p>Kevin is guided through several short levels in succession. To complete a level he needs to collect a number of valuables and lock them in a safe. Only a small amount of time is provided to complete the level as well as a limited number of tries. Levels consist of several floors. Kevin can move between them using stairs, beds that act as trampolines or using food lifts, boxes and cushions. There are also optional items such as hamburgers to collect for bonus points. Levels have an animal running around as well. Harry and Marv need to be avoided, they can be jumped over and they can be shot to stun them briefly. A shot burglar also spawns a bonus item. At the end of the level the score is calculated based on the points through collected items and the remaining time.</p>\n<p>Levels are usually grouped in sets based around a theme such as Family House, Fun House, Green House, Power House and Haunted House. After an initial set of three levels, version four and five of each set are played switching the theme for each new stage. There are 29 levels in total. Each level introduces new graphics and environments, new types of items and ways to move between floors. There are also Bonus House levels without enemies where as many objects as possible need to be collected. Kevin then needs to dash to reach to the safe before time runs out or all the items are lost. There is no save function, password system or a level select; all levels need to be played in one go with the number of tries provided at the start.</p>",

She seeks to bring down the Blue Wolf Society, recruit convicted schoolgirls to protect various school premises and uncover the mystery behind a stolen iron mask. The player will navigate through a number of verbal actions in menus and sometimes use a cursor on the screen pointed at a specific object to perform an action. In certain situations, Saki will engage in combat using her metal yo-yo to beat regular enemies and bosses.
