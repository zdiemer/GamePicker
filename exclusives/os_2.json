        "description": "<p><em>Dungeon Chess</em> is a board game similar to chess, played on an 8x8 board, called the dungeon. The player has access to sixteen weapons of five different types: eight Circs and two each of Arcs, Trigs, Rects, and Stars. Each weapon moves differently: Circs can move one room in any direction; Arcs move like knights in chess; Trigs, like chess bishops, move along diagonals; Rects, like chess rooks, move along the rows and columns; and Stars, like chess queens, can move any number of rooms either diagonally or along the rows and columns.</p>\n<p>Circs and Trigs also have special abilities. Circs, like pawns in chess, can be morphed into any other type of weapon upon reaching the opponent's home row. If a Trig is the last weapon available, it gains the ability to move like a Circ, so that it can access the whole dungeon.</p>\n<p>When starting a new game, the player has the option of starting with an empty dungeon and placing his weapons manually when and where he chooses, or starting with the weapons already placed on the first two rows in a similar manner to the initial configuration of chess pieces.</p>\n<p><em>Dungeon Chess</em> keeps score, but only as an indicator for how the game is going. The game is won when all the opponent's weapons have been captured--there is no checkmate in <em>Dungeon Chess</em>.</p>\n<p>One major difference from chess is that the player can only see those rooms of the dungeon which one of his weapons can access. If, for example, the player has only a Rect left, then only the row and column the Rect occupies will be visible--and the view will be blocked by any weapons that are in the way of movement.</p>\n<p>Two game modes are offered: Master and GrandMaster. In Master mode, the grid of the dungeon is clearly marked and visible rooms are colored differently. In GrandMaster mode, the dungeon is solid black, and the rooms that are visible aren't marked, so the player must carefully inspect the positioning of the weapons to determine which rooms are definitely empty and which are simply out of view.</p>",

If a robot crashes into a heap, it's also destroyed.</p>\n<p>The player has two options, if the robots surround Smiley. First, the player may choose, once per level, to use the Sonic Screwdriver, which will destroy all the robots adjacent to Smiley. Second, the player may choose to teleport to a random location in the level.

Players choose from different types of vehicles: a Heavy Battle Pod (slower, heavier), a Light Battle Pod, or a Hovercraft (faster, more agile). The Light Battle Pod can for instance withstand more damage than the fast Hovercraft, but it quicker than the heavy one. It can also fly for a brief amount of time when equipped with jump engines. The game focuses on close combat with hit-and-run tactics.</p>\n<p>Battles are generally one-on-one set in arenas. The goal is to survive and win the fight, going against enemies from three types of alien races as well as humans and achieving the rank of Battle Master. By earning kill points or picking up items in the arena, the vehicle can be customized and upgraded with armor, weapons and equipment. Pieces can also be sold. The equipment is important for fights, as some arenas have high gravity that greatly affect maneuverability.</p>\n<p>The arena is viewed through a section near the top of the screen. The bottom part holds the vehicle's status with different colours, various meters and weapons, and a rear view camera. The game supports online multiplayer for up to eight players.</p>",
