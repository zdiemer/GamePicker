Like in the original game the player controls a small space craft in the middle of an asteroid belt. The aim is simply to shoot the asteroids while avoiding being hit. When a large asteroid is shot it splits into smaller ones. The craft uses a thrust control to send it forward and two other keys to rotate it left or right. The game has eight different difficulty levels that can be chosen before starting a game.</p>",

It's a fixed screen shoot 'em up where the player's task is to defend a jail that holds three alien prisoners. The jail is located in the middle of the screen and alien space ships move towards it from the sides, ripping it apart one brick at a time. The player has to prevent them from doing this by shooting at them from the bottom of the screen and at the same time avoid being hit by the projectiles they drop. Barriers similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a> offer some protection. Points are earned for each alien shot down, and extra points are earned for those carrying a brick as well as the escaping captives.</p>",

Mutant flies are going rampant in the warehouse and the player's task is to save the fruit from the flies. The game is played from a top down perspective and the runner is always on the move with the player's controls being limited to changing direction. Fruit can be found scattered around the corridors and the player has to pick it up and carry it to the lift. Only two fruits can be carried at a time. Points are earned for each fruit rescued but it's also possible to earn lives by eating the fruit. </p>\n<p>Fruit that is not rescued will turn bad and then into a maggot and finally into a drosophila (fruit fly). Maggots are vulnerable and can be squashed without danger. Making contact with a drosophila is dangerous though since it leads to a lost life but at the same time points are awarded. The player will also come across quibbles which should be avoided since they take all the player's lives.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Lumberjack</em> is a Snake variant where the player's task is to clear the screen of copses, trees and stumps. Like in other Snake games the player leaves a trail behind and colliding with this trail (or other obstacles) leads to the player losing the game. When running over a tree it's cut down leaving just a small stump in the track. Despite being located on the player's trail it is possible to cross over it and it is then removed. The same is true if a new tree or copse would appear on the trail. The player earns 50 points for removing trees, 100 points for stumps and one point for every increase in size of the trail. Copses appear when reaching 1000 points and are worth 500 points. When a copse is cleared it will leave behind a tree.</p>",
