Loathsome creatures crept from the castle and carried the Gem into the depths of the fortress. All attempts to retrieve the Star Gem failed. The adventurers were destroyed. The creatures in the castle gained magical strength from the Star Gem. Unless the Gem is taken from them, the evil ones will soon have the strength to venture forth and destroy mankind. The protagonist and his friends must take up the quest to retrieve the Star Gem and save their world.</p>",

Mine levels are completed when a crystal quota is reached, however the quota is usually not the entire level so bonus points can be obtained by finding additional crystals. Like Boulder Dash, gravity is a factor and affects any boulders, crystals, etc. so they can be used as weapons against demons. There are also deceptive elements, such as \"Dormant\" demons that look like boulders, that add to the challenge. Finally, the robot has weapons that can be used to eliminate certain obstacles.</p>",

They are <strong>S</strong>nakeByte, <strong>I</strong>nvaders, <strong>M</strong>ines, <strong>I</strong>solation, and <strong>S</strong>pecials, which are the demos.</p>\n<p><strong>SnakeByte</strong>  </p>\n<p>This game is like one of many <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Snake+Games\">snake games</a>. In <em>SnakeByte</em>, you are a snake moving about the screen, eating apples. You must not touch the walls or your own body. Each time you eat an apple, you grow longer, making maneuvering that much harder. In later levels, you have objects in the playing field to also avoid.</p>\n<p><strong>Invaders</strong>  </p>\n<p>This is the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8806/space-invaders/\">Space Invaders</a> that has been ported to the Atari Lynx. Rows of invaders move across the scree, firing down at you. When they reach the edge of the screen, they drop down then move towards the opposite side. You are a cannon at the bottom that moves left and right. You must shoot all the invaders before they get to the bottom of the screen. You have three shields to hide behind. Occasionally, a mother ship moves across the screen that can be shot for points.</p>\n<p><strong>Mines</strong>  </p>\n<p>This game is very similar to the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Minesweeper\">Minesweeper</a>. You must make your way across the room, from the upper left to the lower right. There are hidden mines in the room. You use your mine detector to see how many mines are one step away from you. Use your detonator to destroy all mines one step away. You are timed and if you fail to get to the exit in time, all mines will go of, losing you the game. If you use your detonator next to the exit door, you also lose.</p>\n<p><strong>Isolation</strong>  </p>\n<p>The playing area in an eight by six area of tiles. You can move one step in any direction then once you move, you must remove a tile from around you. You and your opponent do this, alternatively, until one of you has nowhere to move and is the loser.</p>\n<p><strong>Specials</strong>  </p>\n<p>This is four playable game demos that the authors are developing.</p>",

While testing a piece of equipment, you are transported into a bubble world. Fortunately, a friendly denizen decides to help you. You must locate the correct type of radioactive particles to move from world to world and finally home, before the hostile denizens of these worlds burst your bubble.</p>\n<p>You move your bubble by pushing in the desired direction. Be advised that you do not stop easily and can bounce out of control if you are not careful. Pushing the A button fires a bubble shot that will ricochet around. You can use this action to bounce shots at enemies that are around a corner. Pressing B drops a bubble bomb straight down. Pressing Option 1 switches options on the screen, including the suicidal \"Burst!!!\", that are then activated by pressing Option 2. The one you will use most is \"Use scanner\". This will bring up the scanner that looks like a radar screen and will show you the approximate location of your needed particles. Once you locate and gather all the particles needed in the level, you move on to the next level. After you finish five levels, you win the game.</p>",

Whilst in this view you need to swing the club and stop it at the desired power and then stop it on the correct symbol to get the perfect hit. If you don't get it right you will either miss the ball or hit the earth. There are 14 clubs at your disposal, 8 irons, 3 woods 2 wedges and a putter which are selected by moving the hand cursor over your Golf bag and selecting the desired club.</p>",

The gameplay involves you driving round a landscape destroying enemy tanks and U.F.O.s whilst trying not to run out of fuel and also not getting destroyed yourself though luckily there are fuel pick-ups and power-ups to collect. You can also use the credits earned for completing missions to upgrade your tank.

You control 1 player at a time and the CPU controls the rest of your team though you can switch to a different player at any time if the need arises. There is also a fight penalty system where you have to continually punch the an opponent in order to proceed.

The gameplay is a point and click style adventure except it has been tweaked to accommodate the Lynx controls. To interact with an object you move Jonathan next to the object with the D-Pad and then its name will pop up in the interaction bar. You then need to select an action such as Open, Close examine etc. The main idea of the game is to explore Dracula's castle while he is away and try to gather information that will prove he is a very serious threat to the mortal world. There are also other characters in the game to interact with and Bram Stoker (the writer of Dracula which this game is based on) is in the game in digital form to narrate the story.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Lynx title based on the Keanu Reeves/Alex Winter film franchise actually takes place after the second film, <em>Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey</em>. Out for revenge after being humiliated by the high-school duo, Death kidnaps their \"medieval babe\" girlfriends from the first film, and drags them throughout history. Luckily, the girls are able to leave behind pages of the band's latest song as a trail for Bill and Ted to follow.</p>\n<p>Playing as either Bill or Ted (with a friend able to take control of the other character over ComLynx), the player must search historical periods in an overhead perspective and collect enough musical notes to open travel to a new area. Along the way, they can encounter historical figures who will offer assistance in return for a favor. Bad guys do populate the levels, but can be pacified with a rippin' guitar solo. If Bill or Ted are defeated, they simply reappear back at the last checkpoint.</p>\n<p>Other items can be found and collected in an inventory. The Lynx title makes use of the series' interesting take on the time continuum, allowing the player to leave items for themselves in the past to collect and use in the future. Likewise, if the player happens upon a sudden fortuitous item that \"they\" left, they must remember to go and leave the item in the past themselves to avoid creating a time paradox. This quirky view of time forms the basis of many of the game's puzzles.</p>\n<p>A password system is constantly updated (viewable at the pause screen) to save the player's progress.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Power Factor</em> is an action-platformer starring the single campily-named hero, Redd Ace, fighting alien creatures known as the Ceegarians from the Ceeg dimension. Of course, aliens being played out, the Ceegarians are actually referred to as \"transdimensional intruders,\" and the Ceegarian creatures the player faces off against are referred to as evil invading \"Sinlendo Techmods.\" </p>\n<p>The primary goal of the game is to work through stages and bosses essentially to build a bomb to destroy the Ceegarians. Pertaining to the bomb, there are six components. The entire game takes place within, as the box refers to it, \"our dimension's reactor.\" As such, the environments of the game are aimed to look like the inside of a machine. To further convolute the storyline, the instruction manual actually refers to the game itself as a Virtual Reality simulation the player is experiencing in the future, based on the exploits of Redd Ace, and you\u2019re meandering through this simulator on the \u201cfamous Atarian Leisure Moon.\u201d </p>\n<p>Stages are fairly small, but designed like a maze \u00e0 la <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7303/metroid/\">Metroid</a>. However, unlike <em>Metroid</em>, completed areas cannot be revisited. Each stage ends with a boss battle showcasing enemy characters that are often two screens high.</p>\n<p>Redd Ace is armed with a multi-use weapon known as the \"Tmat MOW.\" Tmat MOW is intended to be short for \u201cTRANSMAT Multi-Ordinance Weapon.\u201d Four different weapons may be acquired and used for both the A and B buttons, with eight total weapons in the game, and one gun as a standard. Other weapons include lasers, a flame thrower, missiles, bombs, and the like. Weapons must be picked up through playing the stages and collecting various weapon icons. Once the ammunition is used, the weapon is gone and must be recollected. As such, weapon pick-ups must be used sparingly, especially since most contain very small numbers of ammunition, often as low as two shots. Choosing weapons is awkwardly assigned to the Directional-pad, which is also where character movement is assigned. Tapping the D-pad allows the player to select different weapons, while holding it down moves Redd.</p>\n<p>Controlling Redd Ace is somewhat different from a typical platformer of the era. There is no jump button, as both the A and B buttons have weapons assigned to them. Instead, our hero is also armed with a levitation pack on his back, which allows flight. Tapping \"up\" on the D-Pad allows Redd to jump, while holding \"up\" activates the levitator and allows Redd to fly. Aside from a health bar, there is also a fuel bar showing that flight isn't a luxury to be wasted. When crouching, Redd automatically aims upwards at a 45-degree angle, rather than straight ahead.</p>\n<p>Pressing the \"Option 2\" button allows the player to see a menu with information about the bomb pieces the player is collecting, as well as details on the various weapons. If the player is standing in front of a computer monitor when Option 2 is pressed, the menu shows a map of the current area, and information on enemy characters.</p>\n<p>The player starts with three lives, and there are no continues. There are, however, three difficulty modes--Easy, Normal, and Hard\u2014which may be selected prior to gameplay.</p>",

An alternative way to win is to be the first player to hit the mechanical spider. As a round continues longer and longer, the balls will increase in speed, making the round progressively harder. Points can be collected by hitting bricks, special items, and the spider. When one of the players loses three balls or hits the mechanical spider, the round is over.</p>\n<p>If the player wins, the World Party will remain in power.

        "description": "<p><em>Turbo Sub</em> is a first person shoot 'em up. The player is the pilot of the Turbo Sub, the most advanced war device, with both flying and diving capabilities. Earth is attacked by evil aliens so the player is the last hope of the human race. He has to destroy numerous waves of aliens, dodging quickly to avoid collisions and enemy shots. Gameplay is simple: D-Pad is used to move up/down left/right and any button is used to shoot. The speed is not controllable. The aerial phase looks like the classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Afterburner\">Afterburner</a> but in a first person view. The player can dive whenever he wants. Sometimes headquarters will order the player to dive and it means the player is near a gem pod were he can collect diamonds. Near gem pods there is always a supply depot where bonuses (powerful shots, tracking missiles...) can be bought with the collected diamonds. Underwater the player moves a bit slower, and there are obstacles to avoid (like sunken antic temple columns).</p>\n<p>In the two player mode, the winner of a level is the one who has the higher score in this level.</p>",

(2) Turns 100: You win if you have the most money after 100 rounds. (3) First 100K: The first player who has $100.000 in his bag is the winner.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Raid on Tri City: Second Wave</em> is an action puzzle title that mixes falling block gameplay with shooting. It is a physical release and an expanded version of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Raid+on+TriCity\">Raid on TriCity</a> that was download only. The player controls a space ship on a playfield similar to the one of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tetris\">Tetris</a>. The ship can freely be moved around the area as long as its part of a stacked block. New Tetrominoes drop down from the top of the screen. They cannot be moved or rotated, but they can be shot brick by brick. Scoring is done by creating lines, so careful shooting is required to either destroy the block completely or to make parts fit the gaps in the playfield to stack them properly and create lines. The shooting itself does not affect the score. Some of the falling blocks contain power-ups or enemies that can be destroyed or drop to add to the stack. Power-ups such as bombs can become dangerous when lines are formed and enemies restrict movement when part of the stack and can then only be taken out through lines. When the blocks reach a threshold near the top of the screen, the game is over.</p>\n<p>EEPROM on the cartridge is used to save the game and store highscores. Also new to this release is the Story mode. It splits the gameplay into separate levels with a fixed goal to complete them, a narrative about aliens where the player has to save Congis Space Station and the AC2-K11 sector of the Galaxy, and some interactivity with a branching level path. The gameplay for Story is similar to the Arcade mode but there the only goal is to beat the highscore.</p>\n<p>The playfield only takes up about 50% of the screen in the center. On the left there is a picture showing a control element of a space ship and the right part contains the HUD elements. In the Story mode the HUD shows the remaining time, the level objective such as the number of lines, bombs and bugs, and the number of bullets you can shoot at the same time. In the Arcade mode the HUD shows the score, the number of lines, the current level and the number of bullets you can shoot at the same time.</p>",

        "description": "<p><i>Assembloids</i> is a fast paced reaction puzzler based on the 2010 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/130925/quartet/\">Quartet</a>. The playfield consists of 5 windows, arranged in a plus shape. Parts of creatures in different colours appear in the central one, and then have to be moved to one of the four other windows using the joystick. If a window already has the space of that part occupied the player will lose a life. A life is also lost if the player takes too long to move the part. When a full creature is assembled the player is awarded points. The more uniformly coloured the creature is the higher the point gain. If the player manages to clear all the windows and extra life is awarded.</p>\n<p>The game gets faster as it goes on, losing a life will slow it down a bit, but upon doing well again it goes back to getting faster pretty quick. There are a number of difficulty settings available, which have an impact on how fast the game gets and how quickly the speed picks up.</p>\n<p>The Atari Lynx version is a complete rewrite from scratch tailored to the handheld's capabilities.\nThe shrink-wrapped Atari Lynx version includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cartridge</li>\n<li>numbered certificate with autographs of the developers</li>\n<li>cardboard box</li>\n<li>printed manual (in English)</li>\n<li>poster</li>\n<li>multiple stickers</li>\n</ul>",
