        "description": "<p>You start the game as a nameless warrior (you can name the hero as you like). He returns to his home village, only to find it burnt down, and his beloved woman dead. Kneeling at her grave, the warrior swears revenge, but this quest soon turns out to go far beyond it, as demonic forces are threatening the land!</p>\n<p><em>Gens\u014d Tairiku Aurelia</em> is a side-scrolling action RPG. You control the warrior (and other characters whom you can control later in the game) by moving him through platform locations - towns, forests, dungeons, etc. In towns you can talk to people to advance the plot. In wilderness areas, you fight enemies by attacking physically or using magic spells in real time. You can also jump in this game. You get experience points for defeating enemies, gain levels and stronger magic.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Once upon a time, the brave warriors of the Fire Clan fought the dark lord Masakado and defeated him, saving the beautiful land of Jipang. Many years later, the followers of the Daimon Cult tried to resurrect Masakado, but were defeated by the thief Ziria and other descendants of the Fire Clan. Kabuki Danj\u016br\u014d, a flamboyant kabuki performer who fought together with the great hero Manjimaru and helped him defeat the guardians of the Dark Orchids, receives a letter from Orochimaru, one of the heroes of the battle against the Daimon Cult. It seems that the followers of this evil organization have raised their ugly heads again. Several young women were kidnapped, and Orochimaru suspects it was the work of Daimon Cult. Being a perfect gentleman, Kabuki agrees to abandon his flourishing acting career for a while, rescue the girls, and slay the evil.</p>\n<p><em>Tengai Maky\u014d: F\u016bun Kabuki Den</em> is the third entry in the <em>Tengai Maky\u014d</em> series, and a spin-off of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tengai+Maky%C5%8D+II:+Manjimaru\">Tengai Maky\u014d II: Manjimaru</a>. Gameplay-wise, it is very similar to the preceding game. The player navigates Kabuki and other characters who join the party on a large top-down overworld, visiting various towns and villages, exploring dungeons, and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat. Unlike the two previous games, the battles are viewed from a third-person perspective identical to the combat view of contemporary <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Final+Fantasy\">Final Fantasy</a> games. Like in the other games in the series, magic must be found rather than learned, and can be freely swapped between characters.</p>\n<p>The game has a more distinct humorous tone than the previous entries in the series. As before, full-screen anime style cutscenes with voice-overs advance the story. As opposed to the protagonists of the other installments, Kabuki is anything but silent, frequently engaging in dialogues with other characters and displaying his extravagant personality. <em>F\u016bun Kabuki Den</em> is also the first game in the series that takes the events outside of Jipang: a large part of the game is set in an anachronistic, comical version of London.</p>",

You can move your hero around, examine, manipulate, and take objects. You can also duck and have a \"punch\" command.

        "description": "<p>Somewhere on the beautiful planet Aira, in a small village Toto lives a young boy named Rei. Rei possesses unique spiritual powers, using which he can heal diseases. One day, Rei is ordered to go to Tristan, the Royal Capital, where he is needed. This seems like a simple journey; but shortly afterwards Rei meets the cat Nyan, who got stranded on Aira following a hostile encounter with Burakki, Gorokki, and Chorokki, intergalactic feline travelers with unknown agenda. The boy realizes that his powers might be needed to aid the heroes of the previous <em>Cosmic Fantasy</em> installments, and deal with the mysterious Garudo, who recently came to Aira, plotting an evil scheme. </p>\n<p><em>Cosmic Fantasy 3: B\u014dken Sh\u014dnen Rei</em> is the third installment of the <em>Cosmic Fantasy</em> sci-fi anime role-playing series. It is a traditional Japanese-style RPG with turn-based, first-person perspective combat. Enemies appear randomly. Rei and other party members can execute various types of physical attacks and techniques in battles, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The game features anime-style cutscenes with voice-overs. Instead of separate locations tied by a traditional \"world map\", the game has a continuous world, in which locations are seamlessly connected to each other.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The fourth installment of the sci-fi RPG series comes in two parts, this game being the first. In it, the player once again takes control of the original hero of the series, the cosmic hunter Y\u016b, his lovely female comrade Saya, and their friends. Something is wrong on the planet Kazarin: the princess Saria was kidnapped, and Y\u016b arrives on the planet to look closer into that matter, while Saya agrees to impersonate the princess for a while to ensure a calm investigation. However, their quest goes far beyond the kidnapping investigation: soon they will have to face the four heavenly kings, demons who control the elements from which the universe is built.</p>\n<p>The game features a role-playing system similar to the first three installments of the series and other Japanese RPGs: the player navigates a party of characters (up to four active combatants) around the top-down overworld, visiting towns, buying equipment, descending into dungeons, and fighting random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. A new introduction to the series is an ATB (active-time battle) bar (which came to prominence after having been first implemented by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Final+Fantasy+IV\">Final Fantasy IV</a>): the player can only execute an action when the bar of the character in question is filled; therefore, switching between characters and reacting quickly becomes a necessity. The game begins with a \"digital comic\" introduction typical for most Japanese adventures (with menu commands to interact with still anime-style pictures); however, this gameplay mode disappears shortly afterwards and plays no further role.</p>\n<p>The mild erotic elements characteristic of the previous episodes have been somewhat intensified in this installment; a few scenes feature nudity in context of a sexual situation.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The game is based on the anime movie of the same name. In 24th century, piracy is still an issue, but no more in seas and oceans, sailing ordinary ships - the pirates are in space! The most dangerous pirate crew is the one of Sol Bianca - April, Janny, May, June, and Feb. No, those are not names of months, but five beautiful ladies, who can handle some high-tech weaponry and who think only about treasure. But the five lovely pirates are not evil - whenever some tyrant threatens a planet, they are there to help.</p>\n<p>The gameplay of <em>Sol Bianca</em> is that of a traditional Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the five girls as a party, each one having individual statistics. The party of heroines visits planets, travels on the world map, and engages randomly appearing enemies in first-person perspective, turn-based combat.</p>",

On board the space ship <em>Agamemnon</em>, they started an intergalactic journey. But an accident happened, and the humans were thrown into a parallel universe. Years have passed until they have adapted themselves to the different civilization. This parallel world, composed of three huge continents, is called Babel. Zell is a teenage boy, an orphan who lives in a post-apocalyptic world riding his bike, together with his friend Alice, who is like a big sister to him. One day they meet a mysterious girl named Sefia who seems to be on an important mission. Their struggle against evil begins at that moment...</p>\n<p><em>Babel</em> is a Japanese-style RPG set in a futuristic world. Zell and his party travel around the world, visiting large cities and encountering many randomly appearing enemies. During the turn-based battles, each character can use a variety of attacks with different weapons, as well as special techniques. The combat window shows animated moves of the party members. Unlike in most role-playing games, characters do not receive experience points from defeating enemies; only money is gained. The characters level up according to the player's progress in the narrative.</p>",

Van awakens after having a nightmare that has been pursuing him after he has left his home planet Idea and joined Cadette Babette (Rim in the Japanese version) as an intergalactic cosmic hunter. However, a meeting with a friend in trouble from convinces him that his quest is just about to begin. Van and his Little Fox Team must return to Idea, and face the shadows of Van's tragic past.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is virtually identical to that of the first chapter, and has little deviation from the traditional Japanese RPG formula: the player navigates a party of heroes over the top-down world, visiting towns, descending into dungeons, and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based fashion. Like in the previous game, the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Final+Fantasy\"> Final Fantasy</a>-like ATB bar indicates the speed of the characters' turns during the battles. The second chapter also opens with a \"digital comic\" (basically a typical Japanese-style adventure), but after this introduction the RPG gameplay takes over for the rest of the game.</p>",

This version retains the premise, principal story elements, as well much of the enemy design from the original game. The game's locations, however, have been heavily modified, the cities being much larger and containing many more different types of buildings. The world map layout, the dungeons, and the actual game progression involving quests and missions are quite different as well. Gameplay system preserves the simple turn-based combat of the original, while adding new special moves and eliminating the need to select menu commands for dialogue and interaction.</p>",

The adventure starts on a space station near the planet Eldo. The ancient civilization of this planet has long been destroyed, but the unusually beautiful light that surrounds the place attracts tourists from all over the galaxy. Cobra notices that a suspicious man watches his every step. Before long he realizes that his ship is under attack. Who is after Cobra? Will he be able to survive? That's what you have to find out!</p>\n<p><em>Cobra</em> is a Japanese-style adventure. You select commands from a menu (such as \"Look\", \"Talk\", etc.), thus interacting with people and objects. In certain places you can also move your character, viewed from third person perspective. Being one of the first games to use CD ROM format, \"Cobra\" features anime-style cutscenes as well as voice-overs for some dialogues.</p>",

He needs to rescue the wizards and the Ring of Five from the Dark Ones before they invade his home, Krellion.</p>\n<p><em>Shape Shifter</em> is a side-scrolling action game with platforming and light role-playing elements. Much of the game consists of traversing hostile areas, fighting regular enemies on the way and defeating bosses. The game's \"hub\" area is a town where Lykos can replenish his health and buy any of the three available weapons (axe, mace, or bow). These weapons can be upgraded by enchanting them or picking up power-ups.</p>\n<p>After Lykos rescues a wizard he gains access to a transformation power. Transformations require special gems and cannot be performed if Lykos runs out of them. There are four transformations in the game: the panther can jump over large gaps; the shark can swim; the golem can jump higher; and the golden dragon can fly. Each of these forms can also collect power-ups that unlocks a few other attack abilities.</p>\n<p>The game's stages are interconnected, but usually a new form must be acquired before Lykos can access a new area. Lykos has eight lives consisting of smaller health units (hearts). The game can only be saved in the town.</p>",

During the game, Gohan is telling Goten stories about Goku, his father, who died before he was born. As each story is told, it is your job to play out the battles as they occurred in the series. Cinematics help to tell the stories in graphic detail. Other characters from the series will occasionally come to help Gohan tell the stories.</p>",

The most important differences are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You always play as Theron and can hire three additional champions.</li>\n<li>Instead of a single big dungeon there are seven smaller ones, that you each have to traverse in order to find seven special items.</li>\n<li>You can only save in-between dungeons, and your three companions lose all their skills and items after completing each dungeon. Theron also loses his items, but not his skills.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Due to only being able to save between dungeons and the loss of skills after each one the game has also been made easier than its PC equivalents.\nApart from that, it's a classic Dungeon Master title.</p>",

The game has a heavy focus on story and presentation, featuring animated, voiced cutscenes throughout the game's scenario mode, as well as the ability to purchase and use equipment to increase your stats. The scenario mode follows the martial-artist Bang as he travels through a war-torn world with the sorceress Tiria and an all-but-adopted kid named Erue. The \"Advance\" mode lets you choose any character in the game and follow their specific story, building your character's abilities as you go. There is, of course, also a versus mode for two players.</p>",

The captain of the king's knights, Robin Solford, witnesses the dragon's attack on the castle. His two comrades are killed, and the princess Patricia, Robin's adoptive sister, is nowhere to be seen. Robin is determined to find Patricia and stop Dr. Killbait, and begins to wander around the world, hoping to find friends who will help him on his perilous journey.</p>\n<p><em>Startling Odyssey II: Mary\u016b Sens\u014d</em> is not a sequel, but a prequel to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/42725/startling-odyssey/\"> first game</a>, Robin Solford being the father of the previous game's hero. The game is set in a predominantly medieval fantasy-themed world with a touch of sci-fi, and plays like a traditional Japanese RPG. The player navigates a party of characters on a top-down overworld, visiting cities and dungeon-like areas. Enemies are encountered randomly. Battles are viewed from isometric perspective, with an \"auto\" option to speed up combat. </p>\n<p>Characters join the party as dictated by the plot; the party will eventually contain four active combatants. Each character has his or her own sets of offensive, supporting, or healing spells, which are learned automatically when the character levels up. The game features full-screen anime-style cutscenes and voice acting during important events.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A mysterious young woman with a baby was attacked during the Holy Night. She managed to escape, but collapsed and died in front of the church in the city of Yalem. But the baby survived, grew up, and eventually became a hero on a quest to avenge his mother's murderers and save the world.</p>\n<p><em>Seiya Monogatari: Anearth Fantasy Stories</em> differs from most other role-playing games in several important aspects. The player creates the main character in a unique way: when the baby lies on the snow outside of the church, several people pass by. The player can choose to press the action button, making the baby cry and attracting the attention of these people. Depending on the timing of this \"baby action\", the hero will be adopted by different people, which make him belong to a different character class (fighter, thief, mage, or monk), and also lead to four entirely different prologues (once the hero turns fifteen, the four stories eventually merge into one).</p>\n<p>Instead of random battles - or even regular battles with wandering enemies - the game has pre-set battles, which occur much less frequently than in traditional Japanese RPGs. Winning the battles depends less on leveling-up and more on the actual tactics used during the battle. There are no levels in the game; instead, the characters gain better statistics depending on their actions during battles (e.g., using magic will increase magic power, etc.). The battles are turn-based and are viewed from a side-scrolling perspective. The game focuses on exploration, having large and complex locations as well as plenty of items of different categories that can be found if the player explores the game world properly.</p>",

The hero of the game is a young pilot named Harry. He was testing the newest spacecraft model, but it crash-landed on Menaris, a planet at the outskirts of the Eva solar system, with a medieval-like civilization. Turns out that repairing the ship will be anything but easy, so Harry decides to stay for a while and to help the inhabitants of Menaris with their problems, which involve the over-ambitious Doran Empire. With the help of Aria, princess of Menaris, Harry must discover the truth about Doran's intentions, and when he learns it, he realizes that he won't use the repaired ship to return home, but will have to face something that threatens the entire galaxy.</p>\n<p><em>Star Breaker</em> is a fairly traditional Japanese RPG, with top-down view, world map navigation, random turn-based battles, and all the other usual ingredients. Battles can be set on Auto for quicker pacing. Since the setting of the game is a mixture of sci-fi and medieval fantasy, character use a variety of weapons from swords to guns, as well as special psychic attacks. There are also some space ship combat in the game, and it is possible to upgrade the player's ship later on.</p>",

One day, his home village is attacked by a hideous spider-like monster. Kenbu's best friend and mentor dies protecting him. The young hero kills the monster, but soon thereafter has to leave the village and find out who or what was behind that attack. Kenbu encounters other heroes, and together they must stop the evil that is threatening the entire world.</p>\n<p><em>Alnam no Kiba</em> (\"Fang of Alnam\") is a traditional Japanese RPG. Kenbu and his party roam the top-down world, walking on the world map, visiting towns and dungeons, and fighting random enemies in turn-based combat. The battles are viewed from the same top-down perspective as the navigation (like in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/15395/alshark/\"> Alshark</a>). Every action in battle depletes a certain amount of spirit points. The heroes can use regular attacks, magic, and unite attacks, that do high damage to all enemies, but consume a lot of spirit points.</p>",

The clumsy girl managed to lose all of them, without understanding what this could lead to: nobody knows what will happen if the orbs fall into wrong hands - those of the dark goddesses! Aided by a little fairy named Pop, Rin-Rin has to gather the legendary goddesses and to find a way to retrieve the orbs.</p>\n<p><em>Megami Tengoku</em> is based on an anime of the same name (translated as <em>Megami Paradise</em>). It plays like a traditional top-down Japanese RPG with turn-based combat. Rin-Rin uses magical spells to fight enemies. An unusual feature of the game is the ability to change clothes, and the fact that every dress changes the graphical appearance of the character.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Meiky\u016b no Elfeane</em>, the player takes the role of a real person - the Japanese singer and actress Tomomi Nishimura - in her hand-drawn, \"super-deformed\", anime-style, top-down-viewed incarnation (digitized photos of the real Ms. Nishimura can be seen during some of the game's cut scenes). In the game, Tomomi is just a simple girl who works in a restaurant, but gets magically transported to a fairy land. There, she must first protect the inhabitants of a peaceful town from goblin onslaught, and ultimately find a way to return to the real world. </p>\n<p>Despite the top-down view and the fact it was developed y the same <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=laser+soft\"> company</a> who have brought us distinguished Turbo CD RPGs such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=cosmic+fantasy\"> Cosmic Fantasy</a> series and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Babel\"> Babel</a>, <em>Meiky\u016b no Elfeane</em> is not a RPG, but an adventure - Japanese-style, with minimum puzzles. Most of the gameplay involves running around and talking to various inhabitants of the fairy world. There are also mini-games: a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pac-Man\"> Pac-Man</a>-like game with cars, a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up, a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Breakout\"> Breakout</a> clone, and a quiz show.</p>",

Life seems to continue normally, the only trouble being Erika, a snotty high school girl who sees herself as Yuna's biggest rival. She challenges Yuna to a fight, but both are spotted by the titular starship \"Eternal Princess\", commanded by the pretty Princess Mirage, whose task is to stop violence in the whole galaxy. What begins as a misunderstanding ends as a serious threat to the Earth...</p>\n<p><em>Eien no Princess</em> is what is usually called a \"visual novel\". Most of the game consists of the player being taken to different locations automatically, where he watches the story unfold, accompanied by text and voice acting. Sometimes there is a menu verb to click on (such as \"Look at...\"), which doesn't mean much since the menu offers no choices. There are, however, a few turn-based battles in the game, with different attacks to choose, such as attack, defense, special, etc.</p>",

The game's graphics were drawn by the manga artist Izumi Takemoto. The setting is 23rd century, and the player has to take care of three girls from different planets: Naomi, Hikaru, and Edalt. The goal is to make the girls successfully perform their working duties (mostly secretary-like assignments), at the same time having free time to rest. With each activity, certain parameters (stamina, intelligence, etc.) of the girl will increase and decrease. Since the three girls have different parameters from the beginning, it is important to understand their personalities and to find the right balance between work and leisure. The girls also have a \"loyalty\" parameter, that usually increases when the player lets them have a day off.</p>",

Like in the anime series, the game begins with a goblin attack and with Parn leaving his home village together with his best friend Etoh in search of adventure.</p>\n<p>This version of <em>Record of Lodoss War</em> is a traditional Japanese RPG with top-down world map navigation and random battles. There is a strategic element in the battles, allowing the characters to freely move on the battle field. However, the battles can be set on auto, making them more fast-paced and similar to traditional Japanese RPG combat. The towns have menu-based first-person view navigation.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Set in the <em>Record of Lodoss War</em> fantasy universe, created by the Japanese writer Ryo Mizuno, this game is based on the anime <em>Chronicles of the Heroic Knight</em>. The story focuses on a young man named Spark, who wants to become a knight of the country of Flaim. King Kashue needs Spark to prove himself worthy of this title, and tells him to gather a band of mercenaries and prepare to stop the dark wizard Wagnard's mysterious plans.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/43858/record-of-lodoss-war/\">previous Record of Lodoss War</a> game. Spark and his party roam the top-down world map, visiting towns, villages, and other locations on the way. Enemies appear randomly. The turn-based battles once again offer free movement on the screen, but as before, auto-battle feature can speed things up. Towns and other important locations are viewed as still screens from first-person perspective.</p>",

It retains the major events of the story and gameplay mechanics; even though it has more detailed graphics, it still looks too similarly to the original release to be qualified as a remake. The major difference is in the layout of locations and enemies. Some levels are entirely different, even when they are composed of the same elements. For example, the introductory level of the original version is skipped; the subsequent level has a different layout and new enemies. There are more treasure chests in this version's levels, more items, and more areas that require jumping. </p>\n<p>This version also has different cut-scenes (for example, the introduction describes some of the events during Fray's study years, which were absent in the original version). The conversations with other characters are longer; certain events are triggered in a different way (such as the necessity to first talk to the guard to trigger the conversation with the mayor in the first town). There is voice acting during important cut-scenes.</p>",

The improved interface from the second game is now present during the first as well. Even though gameplay-wise this release is very similar to the originals, there are some slight changes as well: enemies are more aggressive, and sometimes appear at different spots than in the original. Although this release contains both games, they are treated as one long game, and it is only possible to start playing the second after having completed the first.</p>",

There is a schedule in the game, which includes school-related and free-time activities. The player characters has various statistics that can be raised by performing certain activities (such as studying to increase intelligence, etc.). The gameplay is dedicated almost entirely to planning schedules, getting the maximum out of the date with the chosen girl. A date is not necessarily automatic success - neglecting a girl for a long time will lead to gossip and eventually may destroy the relationship. There is also a \"rival\" in the game, a male student who might succeed with one of the girls if the player is not careful enough.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>It Came from the Desert</em> is a remake of the the original 1989 Amiga game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=030915109017\">of the same name</a>, but with a vast amount of changes and improvements. The basic setting was kept identical. It is a mix of action and adventure elements, largely inspired from cult-horror B-Movies of the 50's and 60's, and the 1954 film <em>Them</em> in particular. The player plays the part of Dr. Greg Bradley, a geologist and the newest resident in town. Eager to satisfy his scientific mind, Bradley sets out to examine the crash-site of a mysterious meteor, but what he finds is not at all what he had been looking for.</p>\n<p>The game was commissioned by NEC for the TurboGrafx CD console to show off the abilities of the new CD-ROM format. With a team that included many developers of the original game, the graphic, drawn sequences of the original game were turned into full-motion video. These were acted out by real actors, filmed, and then imported into the game, also using full speech. These recorded actors were then imposed on still photos of real locations. The player's input mainly determines the next sequence to trigger or the next location to travel to, and the conversation trees of the original game were not re-used.</p>\n<p>The live footage is mixed with drawn, side-scrolling sequences where the player battles ants in tunnels, along with top-down, drawn action sequences that were also used in the original version. There are also a few events where the player has to aim a crosshair to take out other characters.</p>",

The three campaign scenarios are set, respectively, in the years 1552, 1582, and 1600. The player is put in the midst of the so-called <em>gekokujou</em> situation, when ambitious <em>daimyo</em> (feudal lords) began to overthrow their superiors, resulting in a global war for dominance in Japan. The player controls such a warlord, choosing one of the available historical figures, or creating his/her own character. Character creation is <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Ultima\"> Ultima</a>-style; the player is asked a series of questions, and depending on the answer, the player-controlled general will have different statistics.</p>\n<p>The gameplay involves managing the army, advancing the troops, conquering neighboring provinces, defending own castle, etc. Though the game pauses when the player makes a decision, the time advances regardless of the player's actions, effectively making <em>Tenka Tairan</em> a real-time strategy game. Battles take place on separate screens, with a wealth of tactical possibilities for positioning and manoeuvring the troops.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Addams+Family\"> Addams Family</a> movie, this game is quite different from the other <em>Addams Family</em> variants. The player is cast in the role of Tully Alford, the crooked lawyer of the Addams family. He finds out that somewhere in the family mansion, a great treasure is stored in a vault. He decides to venture into the mansion and retrieve the treasure. Naturally, this is going to be anything but easy, as the insane Addams family members and a legion of ghosts and monsters are there to make sure the lawyer fails...</p>\n<p>Like most other <em>Addams Family</em> incarnations, this is a side-scrolling action game. Tully Alford's only weapon is an umbrella that fires energy shots at enemies. Tully can also jump and duck to avoid enemy blows. The game world consists of a \"hub\" area, the hall of Addams Family mansion, and many rooms, most of which are locked in the beginning of the game. The gameplay consists mainly of exploring the accessible rooms and collecting keys that are needed to open other doors in the process. Some of the rooms contain treasure and power-ups, while others are infested by monsters or require the player to defeat a boss enemy in order to advance.</p>",

Before each mission, the player can choose among different weapons in three categories: main, sub, and special. Main and sub weapons are fired simultaneously and have unlimited ammunition, while the powerful special attacks are accessed by pressing a different button and are limited. The player can try any combination of the three categories, for example enhancing the main rocket launcher with a pod that fires laser to the sides as a sub weapon, and a protective shield as a special one. Power-ups change properties rapidly, so the player has to catch them at a specific time to enhance either main, sub, or special weapon. Those power-ups do not change the properties of a weapon, but rather give it additional fire power.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Mink is a young girl who discovers that she has dragon blood, and is destined to seal away the evil demon Azetodeth. The only way to do that is use the sacred Gourd, which, in its turn, can be made only after having acquired three sacred artifacts. Together with her friends Lufa, Pia, and Princess Vina, Mink embarks on a quest for the artifacts, hoping to defeat Azetodeth once and for all!</p>\n<p>This interpretation of Ryuusuke Mita's manga <em>Dragon Half</em> is entirely different from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=dragon+half+pc-98\"> computer version</a>. It is a combination of a board game and an RPG. Up to 4 players can compete, each controlling a party of characters from the manga. The navigation takes place on a large board, and is controlled by dice rolls. The player can advance only as many steps as the number on the dice; however, most of the board has many different paths and crossroads, which allows certain freedom of movement and planning. </p>\n<p>Different spots on the board have a variety of effects on the party. Red-colored spots lead to turn-based enemy encounters. The player must press a button in time to choose an attack by a specific party member, and also to determine its strength. Experience points are rewarded after battles, and the characters level up in a fashion similar to other Japanese RPGs.</p>\n<p>Other places on the board include damage traps, shops, trigger meetings with other characters, lead to healing spots such as pools and hotels.</p>",

One day, solving a little monster problem in the nearby forest, they encounter a mysterious masked man, who tells Ryeza she wields the power of the sacred jewel Basted. Soon the two girls join forces with a princess in exile, and work together to restore the throne to its rightful owners, persecuted by the ruthless Empire and its allies.</p>\n<p>Though <em>Basted</em> may look like an RPG at first sight (medieval setting, top-down world, game progression that alternates between towns and dungeons, etc.), it is in fact primarily an action game. Controlling Ryeza and Anita, the player explores the surroundings, talks to people and participates in battles to advance the story. There are no levels, items, equipment, money system, or other required RPG elements.</p>\n<p>Most battles occur as dictated by the plot, though some are optional. The battles take place on a separate screen. For most battles, the player is able to choose either Ryeza or Anita. Ryeza can jump, and Anita has a long-ranged fire attack. Regular attacks can be powered-up if executed when the attack power meter is at maximum. Both girls can also charge power to execute devastating special attacks (two unique attacks per girl). They are also able to dash and attack while dashing, inflicting more damage.</p>\n<p>The game features a large amount of fully voiced anime-style cutscenes to advance the story.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The game is based on the comedy TV show <em>Yoshimoto no Shinkigeki</em>, which in its turn is based on a theatrical comedy show popular in Osaka and its surroundings. The game stars characters that either look like the actors from the TV show and/or resemble characters played by them. </p>\n<p>The show consists of short episodes which are depictions of comical situations, and are not related to each other story-wise. Same can be applied to the game: there is no real story, just a stretch of hilarious and intentionally impossible situations the protagonists find themselves in.</p>\n<p>The setting is deliberately nonsensical, with the locations ranging from typical Japanese suburbs to ancient Japan, town in the American Old West, North Pole, etc. Scenarios are full of anachronisms: for example, one of the protagonists is sent in a space rocket to outer space from a desert near an Old West town, bumps into a planet, and falls back without taking any damage.</p>\n<p>Core gameplay is that of a platformer, more precisely an old-fashioned, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Mario\"> Mario</a>-type \"jump-and-run\". Under normal circumstances, the protagonists have no weapons; the enemies are temporarily paralyzed (not killed) by jumping over their heads.</p>\n<p>The game contains a wealth of mini-games, most of which must be completed in order to proceed. The mini-games include: synchronized dancing (through <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=quick+time+events\"> QTEs</a>), rock-paper-scissors variant with pizza throwing, cowboy-like shoot-outs, and many others.</p>",

All the stages are vertically-scrolling (top-down), with the cars represented as small sprites of different colors. The player's goal is not only to beat the other cars, but also reach the finish line safely: each car has limited hit points, and continuously receives damage during the race.</p>\n<p>Damage can be sustained by driving over environmental hazards (pits, traps, bombs, etc.), failing to move the car forward in time (if the screen scrolls while the player-controlled car is at the bottom, it takes damage), being hit by the many enemies encountered in the game (which include a wide variety of wild animals, humans, fantasy creatures, monsters, etc.), or being hit by a competing car. Cars have the ability to jump over obstacles or enemy fire, avoiding damage.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the races, cars accumulate points depending on their results. These points can be invested in purchasing a limited amount of destructive weaponry (missiles, bombs, \"boxing glove\" that hits enemies from the side, oil to drop behind the car, etc.) or protective measures.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Eiy\u016b Sangokushi</em> is a somewhat light-hearted depiction of the famous <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Three+Kingdoms\"> Three Kingdoms</a> historical period in China. In its core, it is a turn-based strategy game, similar to the more popular <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=romance+three+kingdoms\"> Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a> series. The player has the choice of playing through 8 different scenarios, starting with Dong Zhuo's rise to power in the late 2nd century, and ending with the last struggle of Cao Cao's sons and the destruction of the three kingdoms. The player can also construct his/her own map, and play it controlling any of the available <em>Three Kingdoms</em> characters from any scenario.</p>\n<p>The player selects a warlord and his capital city, from which he manages his wars. Compared to <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em>, the game is quite simple, with the battles being automatic and the player having by far less strategic options, focusing mostly on comparing statistics and building a line of generals powerful enough to attack the nearest city. Unlike most other historical games, the game has a comical, \"super-deformed\" graphical style, with famous Chinese warlords presented as typically Japanese big-eyed anime portraits.</p>",

Separated from his companions in the end of the previous game, Sadler encounters a mysterious prophet who tells him a curse has fallen upon Baghdad, and the destiny of the world lies in his hands. Sadler travels to Baghdad, where he encounters old friends and old enemies, and learns about a great threat that stirs hatred and turns people into monsters...</p>\n<p>Like its predecessors, <em>Exile: Wicked Phenomenon</em> is an action RPG. The game is viewed from top-down perspective when exploring towns and other peaceful locations, but switches to side-scrolling view for hostile areas. The player controls one character at a time, but is able to switch between Sadler and his friends (Rumi, Kindi, and Fakhyle), whenever they travel together. Each of the characters has advantages and disadvantages (strength, ranged weapons, spells, limited mobility, etc.). Characters gain experience points and money upon defeating enemies. Leveling up is automatic, increases the characters' parameters and hit points. In towns, characters can buy and equip weapons, armor, as well as healing and supportive items.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This interpretation of the famous giant monster from the Japanese cinematic industry takes form of a fighting game, only instead of the usual brave martial artists the players control horrifying monsters from the traditional <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Toho\"> Toho</a> lineage: the titular beast itself, Rodan, Anguirus, Ghidorah, and others. The game has two modes: Normal and Vs. The latter is essentially a two-player mode, which allows the players to engage in giant monster battles in a variety of scenarios. Most of the monsters, however, are locked in the Vs. mode before the player has completed the Normal mode.</p>\n<p>The Normal mode puts the player in control of Godzilla, who has to go through five stages before reaching the final boss. Each stage has two battles against two different creatures in two different locations, from which the player has to complete only one in order to proceed to the next stage. Depending on the player's performance, points are awarded; in order to be able to compete against different final bosses, the player has to accumulate more points. If the player only has the minimum required points, only one final boss will be available.</p>\n<p>The combat system is similar to other fighting games, with various combinations of buttons executing different moves. Naturally, the normal \"punch-kick\" scheme is modified to suit the monsters' shapes and biological peculiarities. For example, monsters with tails can use tail spin attacks; fire-breathing monsters have a range fire attack, etc. Most of the monsters (including Godzilla) have a move when they hold the opponent and suck its blood.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the manga/anime series <em>Ghost Sweeper Mikami</em>, the game is presented as an episode in the series, with all the heroes and villains already acquainted with each other. The story focuses on the Mikami GS agency, led by the young, pretty, and charismatic Reiko Mikami. The main protagonist, however, is Tadao Yokoshima, a young boy who works for Reiko and idolizes her. Together with their friends, the innocently-looking yet powerful Meiko and the ghost girl O-Kuni, Tadao must rescue Reiko's spirit which became entrapped as a result of a confrontation against a powerful demon. </p>\n<p>The game plays mostly as a Japanese-style adventure, with very limited interaction options; on most screens, only the commands \"Look\" and \"Talk\" appear, and the story advances even if not all the commands are used. Some scenes feature top-down navigation on a map, with icons representing concrete locations.</p>\n<p>In addition to the adventure gameplay, the game also features card-based strategic battles, as dictated by the story in the scenario mode, or as the only gameplay possibility in the free battle mode, which allows the player to choose a character and compete against a variety of opponents. The card game has a \"rock-paper-scissors\" flavor to it, with different attacks winning or losing against others, but also with additions such as wildcards or the option to shuffle the deck with a chance of receiving better cards. Attacks during card battles are displayed as animated sequences.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The plot of <em>Metamor Jupiter</em> is simple: a biological mutation causes an alien race to spread all over the galaxy. Armed with advanced technology, the aliens sent their machines and robots to face humanity in a cosmic battle. To counter that, the humans draw from the newly discovered crystal energy to deploy a unit of powerful fighter crafts, which can change their shapes in an instant, adapting to every situation.</p>\n<p>The player controls one of such crafts, and has to fly and shoot his way through side-scrolling levels populated by regular enemies, bosses, and various types of hazards. Other fighters will accompany the player-controlled machine from time to time, but they usually don't survive the robotic onslaught, and the player character is left to fend for himself. </p>\n<p>As the premise implies, the defining feature of the game is the fighter craft's ability to change shapes. The three main variations have two weapons each, which are suited for different situations. For example, one of the forms has vertical fire, but lacks powerful explosives; another can drop bombs, but has a slow forward beam attack, etc. Each of the forms can gather power-ups, which will strengthen the conventional weapons.</p>\n<p>Unlike most shooters of this kind, there are no \"lives\"; instead, the player-controlled plane has a set amount of hit points, parts of which are depleted when it gets hit. Hit points can be restored by catching power-ups scattered across the levels.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the popular manga/anime series of the same name, <em>Ranma 1/2</em> follows the story of an aspiring martial artist who accidentally turns into a young woman by bathing in a cursed spring. He can revert to his natural form by touching hot water; however, contact with cold water will turn him into a girl again. Most of the original manga story is dedicated to semi-comical situations, based on the fact that Ranma is trying to conceal his predicament, which leads to misunderstandings, confusion, and romantic complications in his high school life.</p>\n<p>This interpretation of the license follows a part of the initial manga story, starting with the curse and going through Ranma's first conflicts with schoolmates and rival martial artists. The game is mostly structured like a \"beat-'em-up\" side-scroller, though there are also several boss fights that are more reminiscent of a one-on-one fighting game. The Vs. mode allows the player to recreate these boss fights using different characters. </p>\n<p>Ranma's curse becomes a gameplay feature in the game: cold and hot water turn Ranma into a girl and a boy, respectively. Female Ranma is quicker and can jump higher, but her attack and defense are lower. Anime-style cut scenes advance the story between the levels.</p>",

Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=ranma+1/2+turbografx\"> earlier</a> <em>Ranma 1/2</em> iteration by the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/4859/masaya/\"> same company</a>, this game does not follow the main manga/anime story, and does not include any other gameplay elements beside one-on-one fighting. However, the game is still rich on story-telling; fully voiced anime-style cut scenes appear after each battle and serve to put Ranma in various situations and set the stage for battles against familiar character from the manga and anime, such as the old pervert Happousai, Mousse, Ryuga, etc. </p>\n<p>The Vs. mode allows two-player gameplay; the players can choose any combinations of the characters who appear in the game to test their skills. As Ranma, the player can revert to his female form (this time at will, simply by pressing a button); the female Ranma is more agile but less powerful. The combat system includes characteristic fighting game mechanics, with punches, kicks, jumps, combinations of buttons to execute specific moves, and powerful special attacks, which can be executed after charging the power.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Road Spirits</em> is an arcade-style racing game, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7765/rad-racer/\"> Rad Racer</a>. The player controls a car from an \"into the screen\" 3rd person perspective, racing through the 17 pseudo-3D courses (named after various geographical locations, e.g. \"West Coast\" etc.). There are other cars on the road, which can slow down the player-controlled car by colliding with it, but the race is against time rather than against these cars. The player is given a time limit for each course, and an indicator shows how close the car is to the completion. Should the car run out of time, the race is lost, and the player has to replay it before tackling the next one.</p>\n<p>The car can be controlled with two buttons only; collisions do not damage the car, but merely make it stop; though the player can change a car model and gear system, no realistic gear-based driving is used in the game. All this contribute to the overall arcade feeling of the races.</p>",

The two travel to the castle, where they meet the king of Satania, and learn of an ancient powerful artifact that has now caused the resurrection of a powerful demon. Ax reveals his own demonic heritage, but is willing to join forces with the people of the kingdom and fight against his kin...</p>\n<p>Completely unrelated to an earlier game of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/30305/sword-master/\">the same name</a>, <em>Sword Master</em> is a tactical RPG, i.e. a hybrid of Japanese-style RPG and strategic battles. The player controls a small party at first, but later can command several units. Most of the gameplay takes place on the battle fields. The player navigates the heroes in turn-based fashion, attacking or casting magic when the enemy is in range. Attacks are presented as short full-screen animated sequences. Characters gain experience after each attack and might level up in the middle of the battle.</p>\n<p>Unlike many other games of this kind, <em>Sword Master</em> contains an additional RPG element in the possibility to navigate the characters in real time in towns and other \"friendly\" areas. The story progression, however, is completely linear, and the player can not explore hostile areas.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=ranma+1/2\"> Ranma 1/2</a> manga and anime series, <em>Toraware no Hanayome</em> consists of several chapters, which are similar to episodes of a TV show: each one has its own story and theme, but all the chapters have recurrent characters from the <em>Ranma 1/2</em> universe. As in the original manga and anime, the story focuses on the young martial artist and high school student Ranma, who was cursed after bathing in a sacred Chinese spring: contact with cold water turns him into a woman, while hot water restores him to his original masculine form. Most of the story in the game is dedicated to Ranma's relationships with his schoolmates and other characters, often involving comic and/or romantic situations, as well as Ranma's attempts to get rid of the curse: in the first chapter, he tries to win a contest that would allow him to travel to China and find a way to turn him into a man permanently.</p>\n<p>Unlike most other <em>Ranma 1/2</em> iterations, this game is a so-called \"digital comic\", which is the same as Japanese-style adventure. Controlling Ranma, the player interacts with the environment by selecting verb commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", etc.) and objects from sub-menus. The navigation is also menu-based. Animated cut scenes appear frequently to advance the story.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The governing planet of the Vasteel Solar System is called Belose. Emperors of the Faracia dynasty have been ruling the planet for hundreds of years. However, the last emperor turned out to be rather unpopular with the people, and they began talking about changing the government system. Unexpectedly, the emperor becomes gravely ill and dies soon thereafter. His elder son, Faliall, is proclaimed the heir. However, Faliall's younger brother, Stefan, cares for the wishes of the simple folk, and is willing to change things. Hence, the bloody war between the two brothers for power and justice begins...</p>\n<p><em>Vasteel</em> is a hex-based war strategy game in its core. The story mode takes the player (who controls either Stefan's or Faliall's armies) through various top-down maps, on which the two armies will try to annihilate each other, advance to a better position, conquer enemy cities, etc. There is also a versus mode, which allows two-player gameplay, as well as access to all the maps regardless of the story.</p>\n<p>The armies of the two princes are entirely robotic; even tanks, cannons, and spaceships are shaped like \"transformer\" robots. Both armies have factories, which can produce new robots, even several times per turn; each such productions costs money, of which there is limited amount. The player navigates the robots in turn-based fashion over the map. Combat ensues when two robots are on the same grid.</p>\n<p>Unlike in most games of this kind, the actual battles in <em>Vasteel</em> are interactive and action-based. The players must quickly move their robots and shoot at each other. Same applies to robots which enter factories and cities with the intention to destroy their protective mechanisms; the defending side uses stationary turrets to fire at the robot, while the latter tries to avoid them and get to the core before being destroyed.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Vasteel 2</em> is formally a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/49061/vasteel/\"> Vasteel</a>; it is also set in the eponymous fictional, futuristic solar system and deals primarily with strategic battles between robots. However, its story is not directly connected with that of the predecessor. The main hero is a young boy named Voice Knuckles, who enjoys a peaceful life with his mother and his girlfriend Diggy. But the cruel Emperor Agares attacks his planet and destroys Voice's home, killing his mother in the process. The boy swears revenge. Aided by his girlfriend and his friends, he assembles a rebel army from fighters who navigate giant robots, and is determined to defeat Agares at all costs.</p>\n<p>The game is more story-heavy than its predecessor, and has more clearly pronounced anime/manga aesthetics. Animated cut scenes occur between the missions and advance the story. Even during the large strategic battles, characters would often engage in dialogue, and scripted events might occur.</p>\n<p>The gameplay also underwent some changes. <em>Vasteel 2</em> is, like its predecessor, a hex-based, turn-based strategy game with robotic combat; however, the action sequences are gone, and the battles now proceed automatically, as in most games of this genre. Robot production and financial management were also simplified or removed. However, the player can choose to use various types of weapons before engaging an enemy in combat. For example, robots can use melee attacks, bipedal tanks can use different laser beams, etc.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the manga <em>Yawara! A Fashionable Judo Girl</em>, the game follows the story of Yawara Inokuma, the teenage granddaughter of a famous judo master. While she is trying to have an ordinary life, her grandfather insists on her studying the martial art of judo, and she has troubles to decide what her goal in life is going to be. The game's protagonist is one of the minor characters in the manga, a young journalist named Matsuda. Seeing how Yawara effortlessly beats up an assailant on the street, Matsuda decides to find out who the \"wonder girl\" is, feeling that she is going to become a famous sports star.</p>\n<p>The game is what is commonly known as <em>digital comic</em>, i.e. Japanese-style adventure game without puzzles and with very limited, basic interaction possibilities. Typically, the player is presented with a few verb commands and object sub-menus at every screen, and has to go through them in order to make progress. Animated and voiced cutscenes frequently occur in order to advance the narrative.</p>",

This time, the player controls Fujiko Itou, one of the original series' heroines, an admirer of Yawara. After having won a major international competition, Yawara feels she cannot bear the fame, longing to return to normal life and leave judo. Shocked by this decision, Fujiko decides to train herself and become a judo master, in order to convince Yawara to come back.</p>\n<p>Unlike the previous game, which was entirely a \"digital comic\", <em>Yawara 2</em> has three different gameplay modes. The Japanese-style adventure part plays similarly to the predecessor and to most other games of this style: the player has a few verbs to choose from a menu; choosing all of them one-by-one invariably advances the story. This part is heavy on non-interactive cut scenes.</p>\n<p>Another gameplay mode is a quiz featuring questions related to the original series; the player has to choose the correct answer among four available ones, and a wrong answer leads to instant Game Over.</p>\n<p>Finally, the so-called \"Battle\" gameplay mode is a judo fighting game. It plays similarly to other fighting games (even with its own story, versus, and two-player modes), but instead of the usual punches, kicks, jumps, and special moves, the player is only allowed to execute authentic judo moves and play by the rules. Many moves involve rapid pressing of different buttons. The player controls Fujiko, and in the versus mode is able to choose to fight fictional champions from the original story line.</p>\n<p>Beside these gameplay modes, the game features an extensive <em>Yawara!</em>-related database, with character profiles, information, and even the titular heroine giving a cooking lesson.</p>",

Depending on the result, the character advances a certain amount of squares, which lead to various quiz challenges. The player has to answer a series of questions within a time limit, choosing the right answer among the several (usually four) available ones. Two-player gameplay is also possible.</p>\n<p>Upon reaching the final square of a \"world\", the player has to face a \"boss enemy\" (usually a character from popular games by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Capcom\"> Capcom</a>, such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Side+Arms\"> Side Arms</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3871/forgotten-worlds/\"> Forgotten Worlds</a>, etc.). The boss offers the player a choice of several available topics for the decisive quiz. \"Defeating\" the boss leads the player into a new worlds with its own structure, etc.</p>\n<p>The themes of the questions are varied, ranging from history and geography to Japanese popular culture and very specific themes (such as bicycles).</p>\n<p><em>Hatena? no Daib\u014dken</em> is a follow-up to <em>Capcom World</em>, offering a few enhancements: multiple paths through some worlds, special squares that lead to new challenges (such as a quiz with only three possible answers), etc.</p>",

The \"gameplay\" mode is a traditional story-driven Japanese adventure, done in characteristic anime style, with cut scenes and voice acting. The protagonist is the cartoon reincarnation of Dr. Akiyama (usually referred to as simply \"Doc\" in the game), who has to solve various mathematical problems in order to get to the bottom of the mystery that involves a giant precious stone known as \"The Indian Flame\". Interaction with the environment is performed in the standard Japanese adventure style, with the omnipresent commands \"Look\", \"Talk\", and \"Think\" with accompanying sub-menus of objects appearing at every screen.</p>\n<p>The \"mathematics\" mode is a collection of all the mathematical problems the player has to solve in the \"gameplay\" mode, accessible directly from the main menu, without the need to play through the story.

In a seemingly all-female city overrun by insane workers, biker gangs, and assorted criminals, Ai and her friends Chika and Makoto decide to work together in order to restore the world to normality again.</p>\n<p><em>Ane-san</em> is what is commonly called <em>beat-'em-up</em>, i.e. a fighting game that allows limited movement through side-scrolling environment. The player can choose to control a variety of female fighters. In the beginning, only Ai, Chika, and Makoto are selectable. Ai is the all-around balanced character, Chika is fast and fragile, while Makoto is very strong, but slow. Later in the game, other playable characters become available. Each fighter has a health points bar, which can be restored by healing items scattered through the levels. Once a character is dead, the player can continue playing with another one.</p>\n<p>The player typically advances through side-scrolling stages, clearing each screen of enemies before being able to continue walking to the right. Each girl has the standard kicks, punches, and jumps at her disposal, as well as special moves, one per each girl. Stages culminate by boss battles (usually two per stage). </p>\n<p>Between the stages, the player can go shopping. A large variety of items is available, some enhancing the performance of the girls, but most purely for visual effect - the room the player views between the stages changes its appearance depending on the items the player has bought.</p>\n<p>Also available between the stages (and as a separate gameplay mode, \"vs.\") is a mini-game, in which the player(s) have to rapidly press buttons in order to make the controllable girl execute a hideous grimace, that will surpass that of the opponent in ugliness and speed of execution.</p>",

Each girl represents her specific area of interest (science, sports, music, etc.), and each wants to be the great winner, for her club's and her own glory.</p>\n<p><em>Asuka 120% Maxima</em> is not particularly story-driven; the story mode allows the player to choose any of the ten available girls, each featuring a short introduction, followed by a linear progression of battles against computer-controlled rivals, with a few bits of dialogue before each battle. The versus mode allows the player to compete against any opponent controlled by computer, as well as two-player battles and a \"watch mode\", in which the player assigns fighters to computer AI and watches how they unfold.</p>\n<p>The combat system follows a rather standard fighting game scheme; the girls execute a variety of kicks, punches, and attacks with special weapons, by pressing combinations of buttons. Girls might have unique weapons and techniques which are associated with the club/subject they represent; for example, a \"tomboy\" athletic girl will attack with baseballs and other sports accessories, etc.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Bazaru de Gozaru no Game de Gozaru</em> is a puzzle game starring a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=monkey\"> monkey protagonist</a> named Bazaru. The concept of the game is remotely similar to that of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Lemmings\"> Lemmings</a>: the player's task is to \"program\" the actions of the hero in order to safely traverse a stage full of traps and hazards. Unlike <em>Lemmings</em>, there is only one primate to control in this game; also, the player's \"programming\" must be performed before letting the monkey loose, unlike the real-time player input in <em>Lemmings</em>.</p>\n<p>The player basically orders the monkey what to do at specific spots (which are highlighted by exclamation marks on the level map). In the beginning the levels are short and simple, and the monkey can perform only one action. As the game advances, the puzzles become more and more complex, and so is the amount of actions the monkey must perform to reach safety.</p>\n<p>The actions include, but are not limited to: running, jumping (in both directions), rolling, pushing, sitting, etc. New actions are learned as the player advances. The player must study the level carefully and often predict the behavior of hostile characters as well as laws of physics, since the monkey can get easily trapped, killed by enemies, fall off cliffs, etc. For example, a wild boar will immediately charge at the monkey; using the momentum, the player can use the animal as a trampoline to jump to higher ground. </p>\n<p>Many levels can be solved in different ways. Alternate solutions are harder to figure out, but may lead to bananas, coins, and other things of interest.</p>",

Instead, the player controls a party of six pre-set characters, which cannot be changed. These character have names, portraits, assigned character classes and even alignments; however, only one of them is given some story-related background, which is shown in the intro created specifically for this version.</p>\n<p>Supposedly the \"main character\" of the game, a paladin named Amuru, is traveling on a ship, when an evil centaur fires a magic bolt and destroys it. Amuru is saved by an elderly cleric; afterwards, the game switches into the familiar <em>Might and Magic</em> free-roaming exploration, with the main story taking a backseat, and the motivations of other characters that join the party unexplained.</p>\n<p>Many encounters and new quests were added to the game, presumably in an effort to make it more similar to Japanese RPGs; however, the main gameplay mechanics remain decidedly Western, with an open world free for exploration instead of emphasis on the story line. Basic combat mechanics remain the same, but many enemies are different; also, enemies might appear in very large groups, sometimes over ten at once.</p>\n<p>While the game still retains the graphically sparse, vast game world which is viewed entirely from first-person perspective, many areas are different, and all the character graphics - for heroes, enemies, NPCs, etc. - have been redone from scratch, having a much more distinct anime edge.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the popular <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=bishoujo+senshi\"> manga and anime series</a>, <em>Bish\u014djo Senshi Sailor Moon</em> tells the story of a group of Japanese high-school girls, who discover that they have magical abilities, and turn into \"sailor\" (thanks to the Japanese high-school uniform design) warriors, who must help the inhabitants of the Moon to defeat the evil forces of the Dark Kingdom.</p>\n<p>The game is structured like an episode from the series. The player can experience the story through the eyes of five protagonists: Rei, Makoto, Usagi, Ami, and Minako. Their stories merge into one later, but the events are seen each time from the point of view of the respective protagonist.</p>\n<p>The game is essentially a visual novel, since the gameplay interventions are very limited and even more sparse than in a typical Japanese-style adventure with its verb commands. The player is able to make choices from time to time, which might alter the subsequent dialogue and/or events; however, the general progression of the story is automatic, without movement or interaction.</p>",

Also, while in the regular mode the player can change the type and direction of weapon (laser, spreading, etc.) at any time, in <em>Before Christ</em> mode, it is possible only upon picking up a corresponding power-up.</p>\n<p>Another change includes the ability to charge the weapon, similarly to the feature in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5960/r-type/\"> R-Type</a>. The charged beam is more powerful, but obviously requires more time to execute.</p>",

Harnessing its power, the Demon Folk grew stronger, and started attacking peace-loving tribes and their villages. One warrior of the bunny-eared Monbit tribe stood up against the demons. Riding a dragon, he entered the palace of the Demon King and shattered the magic amulet he was wearing. However, the warrior was gravely wounded himself. He entrusted the amulet with the tribe elder. Years have passed, and the demons are once again rearing their ugly heads. The young hero is the only one who can save the world - by using the magic amulet's power, and by befriending a dragon...</p>\n<p><em>Seiry\u016b Densetsu Monbit</em> is a traditional fantasy-themed Japanese-style RPG, with the typical progression scheme: the player navigates the hero (and other characters who join the party later) on the top-down overworld map, enters towns, buys weapons and armor, and fights randomly appearing enemies in first-person perspective, turn-based combat. One stand-out gameplay feature is the dragon egg the hero carries from the beginning of the game. As time passes, a dragon will be born, and assist the hero in various ways. For example, even as an egg, the dragon can serve as a healing item that replenishes a small amount of hit points.</p>",

The valiant swordsman Soleil lives in the capital city, and the king entrusts him with the task of protecting the two Moon goddesses, and retrieving the Sun Sword, which are necessarily to prevent a magician known as Silver to use the Gears of Fate for his evil purposes...</p>\n<p><em>Sol Moonarge</em> is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. As in most games of this genre, the player navigates the main hero and his companions on the top-down \"world map\", entering towns to buy weapons, armor, and items, as well as hostile locations which are necessary to complete to advance the plot in a linear fashion. Enemy encounters are random; combat is turn-based and viewed from first-person perspective.</p>\n<p>As in most Japanese RPGs, the characters level up automatically, after having accumulated a set amount of experience points; specific weapon and magic proficiencies, however, grow depending on the amount of times player-controlled characters use that particular type of weapon or spell.</p>\n<p>There is a day-night cycle (on the world map only), which influences people's schedules: at night the shops are closed, but certain characters might appear only during that time.</p>",

Or so she thought, until one day, a talking bird named Nike (like the Greek goddess of victory, not like the footwear brand) told her that she possessed unique powers that made her transform into the glorious lady warrior Artemis. No, Hiwako didn't stop being a spoiled brat; but as Artemis, it is now her duty to protect her home town from a demonic invasion, and she does not intend to give up.</p>\n<p><em>Moonlight Lady</em> can be called a \"pseudo-RPG\"; its top-down view and town exploration make it look like a representative of the Japanese branch of this genre, but in reality, it is an action game with light adventure elements and no true role-playing system. </p>\n<p>Throughout most of the game, the player controls Artemis and two other heroines (Aquarius and Minerva). Attacking is performed by pressing a button for the lead character's attack, and another for a simultaneous attack by the two other girls. The player can switch the leader at any time. The girls can also charge their attacks to execute more powerful ones.</p>\n<p>Regular enemies populate the dungeons, but there is no reward (in the role-playing sense of this word) in defeating them; in fact, the player can try to avoid them altogether and head straight to the boss battle.</p>\n<p>A few items can be found and used throughout the game, but there is no real weapon and armor management, nor a financial system of any kind.</p>",

The band leader, known only as the Flute (the player names him and the other heroes before the game begins), never thought that it will end in such a way... Suddenly, a tornado engulfed the ship, and the poor musician found himself in the magical world populated by angelic creatures and monsters! Naturally, this world, called Astralius by its inhabitants, needs salvation. Only the Magic Flute can avert a demonic threat. Apparently, our hero is the only flutist in all the dimensions, since it is now his task to take the unlikely role of a noble paladin, find other musicians to help him on his quest, and show everyone that music can, indeed, save the world!</p>\n<p>Despite the somewhat unusual choice of protagonists, <em>Mateki Densetsu Astralius</em> is quite an \"old-school\" Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the nameless flutist and other musicians (trumpet player, drummer, etc.), who later join the party, exploring the top-down world, visiting towns to buy weapons, armor, and items, descending into dungeons, automatically leveling up, progressing the story in a linear fashion, and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Casting magic spells is called \"performing\" in the game, though it requires magic points, like in other games of this kind. Those magic points must be bought in special shops.</p>\n<p>Unlike most other PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD RPGs, there are no voice overs or animated cut scenes in this game.</p>",

They enjoy a peaceful life, learning the secrets of the spirits and magical creatures populating the area. But on one fateful night, everything changes. A horde of goblins invades the village, burning it down. And it looks like the local church is in cohorts with a powerful demon bent on destruction! Before the heroes can realize what is happening, they are forced to escape into the forest, with only their magical powers at their side...</p>\n<p><em>Magicoal</em> is a \"pseudo-RPG\", i.e. an action-adventure with some minor RPG elements (money, items, etc.), but without an experience system of any kind. It can be played in two-player cooperative mode, controlling Rhun and Melvy, or as a single-player game, choosing one of them and letting the computer AI control the other. The player(s) can switch between the two at any time.</p>\n<p>Most of the game is dedicated to exploring top-down areas populated by enemies, and dealing with them in action-based combat, primarily relying on magical spells. While some of the spells have unlimited use, others must be \"refilled\" with special items found or dropped by the enemies. Rhun and Melvy learn spells unique to each character, of various elemental affinities and general usage (offensive, support, etc.). Money can be collected from enemies as well and then used in shops to buy items.</p>",

The only time the background story is told is when the player selects a fighter in the story mode. Usually, the five \"good\" fighters have to face the five \"evil\" ones one after the other (each in different order) if selected in the story mode. Though the game's intro states that it is less about who is good and who is evil, and more about who is the better fighter...</p>\n<p>The gameplay is for the most part traditional fighting game-style (with the obligatory two-player battle mode as an option to the linear story mode); an important difference is the fact that some of the characters use swords and other weapons, rather than fight with their bare hands. The traditional \"kick\" and \"punch\" buttons are called \"short attack\" and \"long attack\" here; their execution is unique to each fighter.</p>",

The player is able to construct robots using various parts: body, limbs, computer AI, weapons, etc. The result can be a combination of any forms and components, with the limitation being the overall weight of the robot, which must not exceed a specified amount. Robots can be humanoid, machine-like, rolling on wheels, able to fly or transform into different forms, etc.</p>\n<p>After a robot has been created, the player sends it to fight other robots. The battles look like those of a fighting game, with side-scrolling view and HP bars; however, they are non-interactive. The entire gameplay focus in on creating a robot in such a way that it would be able to defeat a particular enemy; the battles themselves allow no control from the side of the player.</p>\n<p>A \"league mode\" is also available, where the player(s) choose various models of robots and have them compete against each other in a tournament.</p>",

The original stickers had different values; the bizarre Bikkuriman characters were divided into three classes (Angels, Protectors, and Demons), and the highest-rated (and rarest) stickers were the so-called \"Heads\", mostly bearing names from various mythologies and religions (\"Super Zeus\", \"Maria\", etc.). In the game, the player can view a number of the more \"ordinary\" stickers; the \"head\" is available only after having answered a trivia question correctly. </p>\n<p>Each \"head\" unlocks a map part of the Bikkuriman world; each part, in its turn, unlocks a series of short non-interactive scenes from the anime, accompanied by narration.</p>",

The young hero, piloting a giant combat robot of his own, is sent to Sea Square precisely for that reason...</p>\n<p><em>Browning</em> is a side-scrolling shooter. The player controls the giant robot, equipped with a single gun (with unlimited ammunition), and must fight waves of enemies (mostly of a robotic kind), and eventually the stage boss. Short cut scenes appear between the stages. The player-controlled robot has the ability to hover in the air (the player has to repeatedly press a button to make the robot keep the height). The hit points of the robot depend on the condition of its shield. When the robot stands still, shield energy recharges slowly. Complete loss of shield energy makes the robot so vulnerable that the next hit destroys it. The player is given unlimited continues, but must return to the beginning of the stage each time the robot is destroyed.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In this sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/49448/down-load/\">Down Load</a>, the player once again takes control of Syd, a young \"cyber diver\" - a highly trained agent who is able to infiltrate the \"cyber world\", a virtual reality network that has replaced real life for so many humans in this grim futuristic scenario of the end of the 21st century. This time, Syd is up against an even bigger menace: a terrorist organization that has taken possession of Adolf Hitler's brain, in order to re-create it in a digital form, thus reviving one of the most vile and insane dictators in human history! </p>\n<p>Like its predecessor, <em>Down Load 2</em> is a side-scrolling shooter; it shares many elements with the original game, such as the overall setting, \"virtual reality\" levels with abstract design (along with real-world locations), etc. However, the control scheme is a bit different. Instead of choosing a main weapon and a sub-weapon in the beginning of a mission, the player has four types of weapons and is able to switch between them at any time. In addition to the vulcan cannon and the laser beam from the first game, the player can also use homing missiles and a powerful short-range lightning gun as main weapons here.</p>\n<p>All the weapons can be upgraded with power ups, up to three times each. Another type of a power up increases the speed of the ship (yes, Syd pilots a spaceship-like aircraft this time, not his trademark flying bike). Secondary weapons must be picked up, and include additional missiles, bombs, and protective shields. As before, powerful boss enemies must be defeated before proceeding to the next stage. Anime-style cut scenes with voice-overs advance the story.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A young girl named Koruku lived in her home village, enjoying a peaceful life with her sister and her friends. But it all changed when an evil demon known as the Goatbone appeared. With his powers of mind control and shape-shifting, he possessed Koruku's friends, turning them into terrifying monsters, kidnapped her sister, and burnt down the village. A mysterious old man approaches the desperate Koruku and bestows her with a wonderful armor, weapon, and magic powers. The young girl is ready to venture into Goatbone's lair and liberate her sister... but will she be able to defeat her own friends who now obey the word of their dark master?</p>\n<p><em>Fausset\u00e9 Amour</em> is an action platformer, somewhat similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Valis\"> Valis</a> games. The player navigates Koruku through large side-scrolling, platform-based stages, which culminate with boss battles. Koruku dispatches of the enemies with her regular weapon, a kind of chain that can be also used as a grapple, similarly to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=bionic+commando\"> Bionic Commando</a>: double-jumping allows Koruku to attach the grapple to a higher platform, swing, and jump on it.</p>\n<p>When Koruku is hit by an enemy, she loses her armor and continues to fight in her underwear; when she is hit again, she loses even the underwear, and dies (despite this somewhat provocative depiction, there is no explicit nudity in the game). Koruku can also use three kinds of offensive magic spells. Little fairies are scattered through the levels; when hit, they produce spare armor or orbs that can refill Koruku's magic energy.</p>\n<p>Anime-style cut scenes with voice acting advance the story between the stages. Audio CD tracks accompany the game during the cut scenes, and as background music for the stages.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Efera &amp; Jiliora: The Emblem From Darkness</em> is based on the anime <em>Gude Crest</em>. The story stars two female mercenaries, Efera and Jiliora. After having escaped from a slave ship, through a series of events they come into possession of a powerful crest. This crest was taken away from the benevolent prince and princess, who were abducted by an evil cults that worships an ancient powerful deity. The two young women must find a way to save the royal offsprings, and defeat the evil worshippers.</p>\n<p>The game is an RPG with action-based combat. The player can choose to play as either Efera or Jiliora; there is also a two-player mode in which it is possible to control both. Efera is the weaker fighter, but she can use healing and offensive magic spells, which she learns as she levels up. Jiliora is stronger, but unable to cast magic; as she advances in levels, she obtains rings that can enhance her sword power, heal an amount of her HP, and even make her invincible for a while.</p>\n<p>As in most RPGs, player-controlled characters traverse hostile areas and fight enemies for experience and money, which can later be spent in towns to acquire better equipment and items.</p>",

        "description": "<p>An asteroid is nearing the planet Neo Kenya. Scientists warn that the planet might be completely annihilated by it. In a most unexpected turn of events, a deity known as Anubis spoke to people and asked them to save the planet's animals before the asteroids hit it. Anubis sent the humans a huge ship - a magnified version of Noah's Ark - and demanded that one man and one woman should dedicate their time to saving the animals. A whole special team has been assigned to the project. Ken is one of the youngest members of the team, and he is sent on the grand mission to save the animals, together with his childhood sweetheart, the lovely Linda. </p>\n<p>This somewhat unusual premise translated itself into the gameplay mechanics. Though  <em>Linda\u00b3</em> is first and foremost a Japanese-style RPG - with top-down \"world map\", towns, turn-based combat, simple leveling up, focus on narrative and characters, and so on - it also has gameplay features rarely seen among games of its genre.</p>\n<p>There are no random enemies in the game; they are visibly walking on the screen, and a contact with them triggers familiar turn-based battles (viewed from first-person perspective). Hostile animals should not be killed, but captured. They can be then used in towns for a variety of purposes, including weapon and armor enhancement, food, etc. </p>\n<p>Animal saving is pivotal to the game's plot progression; in fact, at the very beginning of the game, the game offers three selectable difficulty levels, which are determined by the amount of animals Ken must save in order to complete the mission.</p>\n<p>Beside hostile animals, there are also certain types of animals (such as dogs) that will join the party and fight alongside Ken and Linda.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Wizardry I\u30fbII</em> contains the first two installments of the <em>Wizardry</em> series: <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Wizardry:+Proving+Grounds+of+the+Mad+Overlord\"> Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1304/wizardry-knight-of-diamonds-the-second-scenario/\">Knight of Diamond</a>. Both games were ported to the PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD console with various enhancements, unreleased separately. In fact, the two games are merged into one, as the player is able to play through both of them continuously directly from the main menu.</p>\n<p>Though the game(s) are rather faithful in gameplay and graphical design to the original computer versions, the enhancements are significant enough to consider this release a remake. Similarly to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=wizardry\">NES / Famicom version</a>, the dungeons have simple graphics, unlike the computer originals with their vector lines. Enemy sprites are also more detailed and occupy a larger portion of the screen.</p>\n<p>A pre-made party of six is available to the player right at the beginning, consisting of characters with generic names (\"Fighter\", \"Samurai\", etc.); creating own characters (unlike in the modified PC Engine CD version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/49135/might-and-magic/\"> Might and Magic</a>), however, remains possible.

The game follows the same story for the most part, and contains the cut scenes from the original version. Like most PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD games, it features voice acting during cut scenes and CD audio tracks.</p>\n<p>Several cut scenes were added, and some dialogues expanded. Though the story progression and the areas the characters have to traverse in order to advance it remain intact most of the time, the gameplay system has received an overhaul, being essentially developed from scratch. The \"RPG-lite\" feel of the original version is now somewhat compensated by the ability to equip weapons and armor, as in most RPGs. Combat engine has also been modified; instead of the isometric battle screens of the original, the battles are now viewed from \"over-the-shoulder\" third-person perspective, with player-controlled characters visibly attacking the foes, similarly to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6584/phantasy-star-iv/\"> Phantasy Star IV</a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Sylphia</em> is set in an environment inspired by the Greek mythology. The heroine of the game was a fearless maiden who tried to protect her home town from the onslaught of monsters. But even her power was no enough, and she was slain... Touched by her sacrifice, the goddess Athena revived her as a flying demi-goddess. Restored to new life, Sylphia can now unleash her wrath upon the monsters and their supporters.</p>\n<p>Despite its theme and setting, <em>Sylphia</em> plays like a vertically scrolling shooter. As in most games of this kind, the gameplay consists of shooting down waves of enemies, on the ground and in the skies. Sylphia can use four types of ranged attacks, which roughly correspond to other shooters' traditional weapons: fire blasts, laser, spreading fire, homing missiles. These weapons are displayed as colored orbs and must be collected. Power-ups can be collected for each type of attack. In addition, a devastating special attack can be stored (for one charge) and executed.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Long time ago, a thriving civilization blessed by the gods was ruined as a result of a perpetual war. Humanity has built a new civilization, which resembles a medieval world. The young swordsman Jan lives In the kingdom of Cordelia. One fine day he and Ortena, the daughter of the High Priest, go on a treasure hunt. When they return, they find the country overrun by monsters; Ortena's father is killed, and the princess of Cordelia has been kidnapped. The two team up with a legendary hero, in order to rescue those who can still be rescued, and fulfill the legacy of the gods...</p>\n<p><em>Ruin: Kami no Isan</em> is an action RPG. The player navigates Jan through top-down towns and hostile areas; the \"world map\" is not free-roaming, allowing only linear advancement from location to location. Hostile areas are populated by enemies who are visibly walking on screen. </p>\n<p>Unlike most Japanese RPGs, there are no separate \"battle screens\" in the game; the monsters are fought on the same spot they are encountered on, like in action games. However, unlike most action RPGs, there is a party in <em>Ruin</em>. The player controls only Jan, while the other party members act according to AI routines: attacking, casting offensive and healing spells, etc. </p>\n<p>The rest of the gameplay is traditional Japanese RPG style: acquiring better weapons and armor, automatic leveling up, linear story development, etc.</p>",

Teaming up with two other warriors, the hero meets a benevolent sorceress named Garland, who sends them on a quest to rid the land of fairy creatures who got rampant, and help her in her battle against the evil sorceress whose plan is to destroy peace forever.</p>\n<p>Like other <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/7016/games-express/\"> Games Express</a> titles, <em>Hi-Leg Fantasy</em> is an erotically-themed parody on a well-known game franchise - in this case, obviously the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Final+Fantasy\"> Final Fantasy</a> series, most particularly its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=final+fantasy+v\"> fifth installment</a>. Combat, character growth, even menu design strongly remind of classic <em>Final Fantasy</em> games; as in those, the battles utilize the ATB (active time battle) system. The \"job\" system from <em>Final Fantasy V</em> is implemented here as well.</p>\n<p>The adult element is present in the battles. Enemies are young and sexy girls, mostly fairy creatures of various kinds. As they sustain damage in battles, they begin to lose their clothes, until they become naked upon defeat.</p>",

This game is particularly reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/47306/tanjo-debut/\"> Tanj\u014d: Debut</a>: the player also manages the lives of three young girls, whose goal is eventually to become what the Japanese call \"idol\", i.e. a pop star.</p>\n<p>Compared to <em>Tanj\u014d: Debut</em>, <em>AV Tanj\u014d</em> has simpler gameplay. The player creates schedules for the girls, composed of various activities: studying, aerobics, date, rest, work as a hostess, etc. These activities influence the girls' statistics, and also change their moods. For example, working too much without resting might make a girl sick. </p>\n<p>Eventually, the girls will turn into what the player wants them to be - full-time hostesses, singers, etc.; but the \"true\" goal of the game is to unlock all the pictures of the girls in a variety of sexy poses. Some of these pictures feature nudity, which effectively makes <em>AV Tanj\u014d</em> an adult game.</p>",

The nameless protagonist finds a girl in a Japanese high-school uniform, tied and blind-folded. The entire scenario consists of a long scene, during which the \"hero\" proceeds to rape the girl.</p>\n<p>The interactivity level is even lower here than it was in its predecessors. Not only there are absolutely no variants in command selection; the commands themselves must be selected in a specific order every time to trigger the next scene (eye icon, hand icon, mouth icon); all the icons are \"blocked\" before the previous one is selected.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This installment of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Shiawase+Usagi\"> Shiawase Usagi</a> abandons the heroines of the two previous games in favor of characters curiously named after <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=neon+genesis+evangelion\"> Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> heroes: the protagonist is called Shinji, the love interests Misato and Asuka, etc. The plot, however, has little to do with that of the anime series: the hero is a horny young man (aren't we all?) who is watching a porn movie and decides to get some real \"action\". Afterwards, it becomes a series of sexual encounters, which proceed depending on the player's choices.</p>\n<p>Being a visual novel, the game can develop into different directions story-wise. The only gameplay consists of deciding where to go and/or what to do. Depending on the player's decisions, the story will be concluded with various endings, \"happy\" as well as \"bad\".</p>",

        "description": "<p>In a galaxy called Urora, two star systems were engaged in a prolonged war for domination: the federation of Soron and the Vado Empire. A peace treaty was signed between them; but the governments of either side knew that sooner or later there will be war again. The scientists of Soron developed a highly advanced technique, infusing human organism with powers of spirits. Five young ladies, under the command of Jennifer Sylkis, were imbued with this augmentation, which allowed them to pilot giant combat robots. Soon the fight for galactic supremacy will begin...</p>\n<p><em>Lady Phantom</em> is a turn-based strategy game. The game consists of linear missions, which take the player to large strategic battles; the goal is usually to eliminate all enemy units, though mission objectives such as reaching a certain area or preventing a certain key character from getting killed are also present. The player commands the five combatants, choosing their equipment before each battle. The battle screen is composed of hexagons; the characters have turns depending on their agility rating. When player-controlled or enemy character attack each other, an automatic battle sequence ensues.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The most famous story of the heroic past is called \"Knights of Legend\". It is a story about heroes who have descended into hell, defeated the Demon King, and saved the seven worlds from grave peril. This story is now taught in all the schools for young adventurers, who wish to become heroes and defeat the minions of hell once and for all. Those who have already graduated are called \"travelers\"; four of them are the heroes of the game - two young men and two young women. Led by the reckless swordsman Ufuru, the travelers begin to roam the land in search of adventure...</p>\n<p>The game is a rather traditional Japanese RPG. The player always controls the party of four heroes; the two men use sword techniques, one of the girls specializes in offensive magic, while the other one is a healer. The player navigates the party over the \"world map\", visiting towns and descending into dungeons. Randomly appearing enemies are fought in turn-based style. Leveling up is automatic, like in most games of the kind. There is a day/night cycle in the game.</p>",

As in most games of its kind, the action revolves around shooting waves of continuously attacking enemies, facing bosses to terminate stages. </p>\n<p>The player can collect colored power-ups that will modify the ship's weapons, turning them into an explosive gun (red), flame laser (green), and multi-way fire (blue). These power-ups are constantly rotating, and picking them up at specific moments will change the direction they are facing - up, down, left, or right. By holding the attack button the player can charge the ship's power, unleashing explosive attacks. It is also possible to increase the ship's speed for a quick thrust, which makes it easier to evade enemy fire.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This version of <em>Dragon Knight III</em> is based on the earlier computer release, known in the West as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1665/knights-of-xentar/\">Knights of Xentar</a>. While retaining the story, the graphical style, and the basic location layout of the computer version, this release has substantial gameplay differences.</p>\n<p>Unlike in the computer version, the battles are not real-time, but turn-based, and utilize a different perspective; randomly encountered enemies are fought in a first-person, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=dragon+quest\">Dragon Quest</a>-like traditional Japanese RPG style. Enemy design is also quite different; many of the monsters from the original version have been replaced with female characters. The graphics in the top-down areas have been slightly enhanced.</p>\n<p>This version also censors the adult content. The scenes are still suggestive, but there is no explicit nudity in them any more. Some of the cutscenes have been completely re-drawn, eliminating even implicit sexual activity.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Motteke Tamago</em> was included in the second volume of the Super PC Engine Fan Deluxe magazine. It is an action game similar in concept to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=bomberman\">Bomberman</a>. The game consists of three \"worlds\", each with ten screens; on every screen, four ducks are competing against each other in collecting eggs and delivering their babies home. The ducks can be controlled by human players or by computer AI. Eggs are being dropped into the maze-like stage; the goal is to collect as many of them as possible. Once collected, an egg follows the duck, and after a while a baby would hatch and return home safely.</p>\n<p>Each duck tries to sabotage the work of other ducks by placing fried eggs on their paths. In addition, various hazards and enemies keep appearing, trying to impede the ducks' progress. Ducks can be knocked down, paralyzed, and robbed of their eggs.</p>",

Each mode allows the player to select a car and customize its steering, gears, brakes, etc. Car controls are fairly simple, with one button assigned to accelerating and another to applying brakes.</p>",

Teams can be controlled by human players or computer AI; it is also possible to select the \"watch\" mode and view the game unfolding with both teams being controlled by the computer. Practice mode for corner, free, and penalty kicks is included as well. Rules and conditions can be changed (e.g. it is possible to play without injuries).</p>",

Both Hiro and Michiko can accumulate special energy (dropped by the enemies along with health power-ups and money) that allows them to transfer into the superheroes Gayvan and Mittchi and stay in that form until they run out of energy. The superhero forms are stronger and are able to execute special attacks.</p>\n<p>In addition, a two-player versus fighting mode is included.

        "description": "<p><em>God Panic</em> is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up set in a cartoony, anachronistic version of feudal Japan with supernatural elements. There is no in-game background story or plot-advancing cutscenes, with the exception of a wise old man who would sometimes offer the cat-suit-clad hero some help. Creatures from Japanese mythology have gone wild, and it is up to the flying protagonist to defeat them, all the while defending himself against enraged villagers, mechanical cats, homoerotic wrestlers and other grotesque beings.</p>\n<p>The player character is armed with a standard gun in the beginning, which shoots in two lines straight in front of him. Power-ups are obtained by flying over treasure chests, usually placed on top of the screen. These grant the hero wingmen, additional shots, a new ray attack, extra lives, etc. Like in most scrolling shooters, a button is assigned to a powerful all-screen attack (in this case throwing coins) with limited charges. Stages culminate in boss battles, and some of them are built as a series of mini-boss encounters.</p>",

There is no background story information in the game besides the notion of TDF2, an organization consisting of aircraft and mechas, fighting an alien race known as Plea. The gameplay is quite simple: the player is presented with a fairly small isometric screen and must navigate a handful of fighters on it, attacking an alien when he is on the adjacent square. Player-controlled mechas and vehicles come in different types: some are strong but have limited manoeuvrability, others have a wide movement range but weak armor, etc. Battles are shown on a separate screen and proceed automatically, both sides exchanging an attack.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Gyuwambler Jiko Ch\u016bshinha: Mahjong Puzzle Collection</em> is not a mahjong game; rather, as the title implies, it is a puzzle game that uses mahjong tiles. The player is presented with a board full of mahjong tiles; the goal is to match identically-looking tiles in pairs, causing them to disappear. Only tiles that have no obstacles (i.e. other tiles) on their path to each other can be matched. New tiles are added by the game on squares adjacent to the removed ones. The player must think ahead in order to complete the puzzle, avoiding unwinnable situations.</p>\n<p>There are nine different boards, with tiles placed in different patterns of varying difficulty. In addition, there are four difficulty levels, measured by the time limit allowed for each puzzle (the easiest level has no time limit at all). Characters from the Gyuwambler Jiko Ch\u016bshinha manga can be asked for advice a limited number of times.</p>",

There is no background story in the game and no cutscenes; the player pilots a fighter plane, flying over various areas such as a desert, a sea, a city at night, etc. Most of the enemies are different types of aircraft, though a few stationary turrets appear as well. </p>\n<p>The player-controlled fighter can pick up power-ups that change his primary weapon: red for a vulcan gun, yellow for energy bolts, and blue for laser. Each of these will increase in power (e.g. three lasers instead of one for the blue weapon) when the player repeatedly collects power-ups of the same color. Other power-ups add a secondary weapon or enhancement to any of the described above, such as homing missiles, fireballs, a wingman, etc. Secondary weapons are fired simultaneously with the main ones. In addition, special weapons can be collected and accumulated. These weapons are triggered by pressing a separate button, and include delayed bombs, exploding bullets, protective shields, and others.</p>",

The battle then proceeds automatically, its result calculated by the statistics of both units.

It is possible to choose club types and (in the practice mode) golf course. The game is played from a first-person perspective, and requires the player to stop a moving bar at the correct moment to regulate the strength of the short.</li>\n<li><em>Formation Soccer: Human Cup '92</em> is a top-down soccer (football) game that allows the player to choose an international team out of several available European and American ones. Formation and goaltender behavior can be customized; however, no detailed player management is present. The championship mode allows one or two players to compete against the computer.</li>\n<li><em>Final Match Tennis Ladies</em> is similar in style to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/47343/final-match-tennis/\">Final Match Tennis</a>, but with notable female tennis players (their names are slightly altered). It is possible to choose one of the three available tennis court types, as well as go through the Australian Open tournament controlling one competitor in a cup system.</li>\n</ul>",

The game involved gathering at night, lighting a hundred candles and telling horror stories, extinguishing the candles one by one until the room became completely dark.</p>\n<p>The game contains a hundred horror stories told in a linear fashion through text, digitized photos and sound effects. Most of the stories are very short and non-interactive. The exceptions usually involve visual novel-like choices of locations or responses to situations, which sometimes affect the story's conclusion. A recurrent episode involves visiting various locations in Tokyo area and reviewing criminal cases and ghost stories.</p>",

        "description": "<p>During the Edo period in Japan, the ninja clans from Iga and K\u014dga were fighting each other. A mysterious foreigner named Doppelgen Hauser, aided by the K\u014dga ninjas, kidnapped princess Mayura. An Iga ninja named Hattori Ga\u014d swore to catch up with the criminal and rescue the princess, but the ninjas from the K\u014dga clan will do anything in their power to stop him.</p>\n<p><em>Iga Ninden Ga\u014d</em> is a side-scrolling action game very loosely based on historical events, with plenty of anachronisms and supernatural elements. Ga\u014d mostly uses his sword to defeat enemies; he can also jump and attack in mid-air. Sometimes it is necessary to jump over bottomless pits or other obstacles to advance. Pressing down the attack button will charge a special meter that will allow Ga\u014d to throw knives at enemies. In addition, Ga\u014d possesses special powerful all-screen attacks that come in limited quantities. Enemies may drop charges for such attacks, health-restoring items, and other power-ups. Stages usually culminate with boss battles, after which the hero gains access to new weapons and armor.</p>",

Each \"enemy\" will ask the hero one question in a variety of topics (English language, geography, popular culture, etc.). Answering the question correctly within the time limit will \"kill\" the enemy, while giving a wrong answer will reduce the hero's HP by one point.

A group of four treasure hunters come across an announcement promising a reward of one million credits to whoever would recover a mysterious purple stone with the engraving of the Empire's crest on it. The four find the artifact relatively quickly, but it is stolen from them by another group with an agenda of their own. Now the heroes must bring the stone back while dealing with the dangerous foes on their way.</p>\n<p><em>MysticFormula</em> is a top-down shooter. The player navigates the protagonist through hostile environments, shooting at regular enemies and bosses, and avoiding their attacks. The player can choose to control any of the four treasure hunters: a balanced lead character armed with a laser pistol; an elf who shoots fireballs from her staff; an agile female thief; and a sturdy, slow, yet powerful robot. All the characters use ranged attacks that can be upgraded with power-ups. In addition, another type of a power-up brings forth one of the characters from the group to aid the player in combat, controlled by the AI. Two-player mode is available as well.</p>",

The goal of the game is to win as many jewels as possible by collecting points in pachinko games. The player has a limited control over Pachio-kun in top-down casinos, where the game can be saved, points exchanged for jewels, and all the pachinko machines accessed. The machines are presented in first-person view and come in varied flavors and designs, with different backgrounds, themes, and contraptions. Playing the machines involves adjusting the strength of the shot and then pressing the action button to release the balls. The player can also opt to view each detail of the machine on a zoomed-in screen. The game comes with a special controller that resembles a real pachinko joystick.</p>",

However, a malevolent alien race has found a way to harvest its power and is now preparing for its reincarnation. Pachinko Planet was attacked, and its king slain. Returning from an interstellar travel, Pachio-kun boards the spacecraft Sledgehammer and embarks on a journey to defeat evil and restore his homeland.</p>\n<p><em>Pachio-kun: Warau Uch\u016b</em> is a pachinko game with a storyline and limited top-down exploration. In most areas, Pachio-kun has to complete one or more pachinko games in order to be able to leave the location and advance the plot. Pachinko machines come in different flavors and difficulty levels. The controls are fairly simple, requiring the player to adjust the strength of the shot; the shots themselves can be fired automatically. The game was shipped with a special controller similar to a real pachinko device.</p>",

The game's plot is rather abstract and serves to tie together various time periods to which the hero travels after completing pachinko-playing sections. In each area there are casinos with pachinko machines. The player can talk to characters in the casino, exchange money for chips and vice versa, and play pachinko on variously themed machines. New areas become accessible after the player has won a sufficient amount of money in the previous casino.</p>",

One of the female crew members unexpectedly faints and is taken by her friends into an abandoned mansion discovered nearby.

Mei Star, an investigator with the team, and her computerized holographic assistant Navi must solve the mystery before it becomes too late.</p>\n<p><em>Private eye dol</em> is an adventure game played for the most part from a top-down perspective. The player navigates Mei around the playable environment, examines places and items of interest, and talks to other characters. With a few exceptions, there are no puzzles in the game, and the plot is advanced by triggering events. On several occasions items must be picked up, but they are used automatically in correspondent locations.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Psychic Storm</em> is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player takes the role of four characters who must protect Neo Hong Kong City from an assault by vicious insectoid aliens. The player can select any of the four characters before each stage. The characters are distinguished by the unique attacks of their ships: Alex uses a vulcan gun, Charr has short-ranged \"psychic\" beam, Joe has a slow, yet powerful Hell Flame attack, and Nastasia uses ion laser. Each character can also acquire additional weapons by picking regular power-ups.</p>\n<p>The game's stand-out feature, however, is its transformation mode. Each of the characters can transform to a larger and much more powerful biomechanical insect-like ship. The transformation can be performed at any time as long as the correspondent bar, which refills itself over the time, is not empty. The bar is reduced rapidly when the character is transformed; special power-ups can be collected from vanquished enemies to extend it temporarily, but once it is depleted the character transforms back to his or her normal form.</p>",

After the evil Shameless were vanquished, peace was restored in the kingdom of Erudition; however, soon demonic forces appeared on the horizon, and two young warriors, one boy and one girl, were sent by the queen to stop them.</p>\n<p>The quiz rules in this installment are largely the same as in the previous entry, with three or four answers to choose for each question and a time limit. The board advancement, however, is determined by choosing cards with the amount of steps written on them rather than by dot-to-dot movement of the first game. New is the two-player mode for the quest, in which the second player controls the heroine, and the two are answering questions simultaneously. A few new features, such as the possibility to acquire various bonuses before a quiz encounter, have been added. The party mode is replaced by the so-called \"F1 Grand Prix\", which is a series of trivia questions where each round is presented as a Formula 1 race.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Quiz Avenue III</em> offers, like its two predecessors, a quest mode and a versus mode - the latter consists in this installment of a series of trivia questions for up to eight players (controlling a variety of tough-looking fighters), with rounds disguised as fighting games, each wrong answer leading to a loss of hit points. The main difference between this entry and the previous ones lies in the quest mode and its RPG elements.</p>\n<p>Like a full-fledged role-playing game, the quest mode has leveling up, free top-down navigation, overworld, towns, dungeons, monetary system, weapons, armor, items, and even companions who join the main heroine, a girl named Konoha, who was raised by an old fighter and has to use her special abilities to rid the land of monsters. Battles occur randomly; the player has the choice to try to escape before the battle begins. Each enemy asks a row of trivia questions; correct answers damage the enemy and eventually defeat him, while wrong answers deplete the HP of the controllable characters. Levels, weapons, armor and items contribute to the damage equation, raising or lowering the amount of questions needed to answer correctly in order to prevail.</p>",

The main mode involves a quiz competition in which players can choose the topics of the questions, e.g. movies, video games, history, etc. Up to five players can participate in this mode or compete against the computer AI. </p>\n<p>The \"adventure mode\" is a board game in which the player-controlled character's movement is determined by a dice roll. Normal fields lead to short quiz encounters; other fields may enhance the protagonist's hit points, and the final field on each stage is a more challenging \"boss battle\". </p>\n<p>Time attack mode involves answering correctly as many questions as possible within the allotted time limit. Finally, versus mode has players competing against each other; every right answer advances the character on a board, while the opponent is pushed back. All modes feature characters from other games published by Hudson Soft, such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=bomberman\">Bomberman</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tengai+Maky%C5%8D\">Tengai Maky\u014d</a> series.</p>",

The game show has three modes: \"World Quiz Trip\", championship, and cup. The first is essentially a single-player mode; the championship allows players to compete against each other, with topics randomly chosen; the cup works like any comparable sports event, including elimination rounds.</p>",

The Time Machine mode involves traveling to different time periods and answering trivia questions in order to trigger famous events (e.g. Moses creating a path through the Red Sea for the Jews, the belligerents of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=three+kingdoms\">Three Kingdoms</a> era attacking each other, apple falling on Sir Isaac Newton's head, etc.). The questions themselves, however, have usually nothing to do with the historical event in question. </p>\n<p>Another mode in the game is called \"Megaten Quest\"; however, it is not a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Megami+Tensei\">Megami Tensei</a> related quiz, but rather an imitation of a first-person dungeon crawler with randomly appearing enemies who ask the player a certain number of question on various themes. The third mode follows the same quiz format with correctly answered questions leading to puzzle solutions, and is essentially the multiplayer portion of the game. In all modes, time limit is imposed on the entire round rather than on separate questions.</p>",

Hoshimaru can be navigated over a board (often with branching paths); each field usually leads to a conversation scene with a following quiz. Both Hoshimaru and the \"enemies\" have life bars; the protagonist's health increases after successfully completed quiz challenges. Correct answers damage the enemy, while wrong answers deplete the hero's life. The amount of possible answer to select from and the nature of trivia questions varies from quest to quest.</p>\n<p>Other modes include a multiplayer tournament, a time attack mode in which players have to answer as many questions as possible within a time limit, and two multiplayer modes that allows players to represent various characters and mimic a fighting game and a Formula 1 Grand Prix.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Renny Blaster</em> is a beat-em-up in which the player can choose to control either the paranormal private investigator Fujiro Yarai, or a man with a mysterious past and supernatural abilities named Seishiro. The two characters have the same goal: prevent a secret organization of monsters and undead, run by a maniacal vampire, from taking control over Europe. The two characters begin with different initial stages, but continue on the same path afterwards. Seishiro is physically weaker and has a default ranged energy attack; Fujiro fights with regular punches and kicks. Both characters have access to unique elemental attacks that are activated by holding down a button. Most of the stages are straightforward side-scrolling action with boss battles at the end of each; a few areas contain light platforming elements.</p>",

There is no scenario selection, and the exact timeline is not specified, though the initial situation corresponds to the phase of the war when Liu Bei and Cao Cao were the principal opposing forces. Players can choose to control any of the six most renowned warlords of the time, Liu Bei being the \"default\" player character with his own extended introduction and personal motives reminiscent of Luo Guanzhong's novelization of the historical events.</p>\n<p>Each warlord tries to gain dominance by building up diplomatic relationships and invading other provinces. It is possible to send offerings and diplomatic missions to other rulers, as well as manage army commanders, finances, and provision. Invasions take place on a tactical hexagonal grid, on which the player positions his forces and navigates them in turn-based fashion. When opponents meet on adjacent fields an automatic battle sequence ensues.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Sengoku Kant\u014d Sangokushi</em> is a turn-based historical strategy game set during the Sengoku period of the Japanese history. The player can take control of one of the three prominent warlords of the era: Uesugi Kenshin, H\u014dj\u014d Ujiyasu, or Takeda Shingen. Each warlord initially controls a province with several towns, and tries to win over territory by diplomatic or military means. Every turn the player has a limited amount of moves at his or her disposal; every general has his own options, though some (e.g. marriage) are restricted to the main warlord himself.</p>\n<p>Each town has to survive and raise reputation by maintaining an army and keeping the population happy. This is achieved by trading (buying and selling rice), giving money to civilians or soldiers, developing the town, etc. Every general can also strike alliances with rulers of other provinces, sign agreements, and send spies. </p>\n<p>When an area controlled by a general is invaded by the enemy, the game switches into a top-down turn-based tactical battle mode. The player positions and navigates soldiers, engaging in automatic battles when the opponents meet on adjacent squares. Castle invasion and defense can be carried out through various means: for example, it is possible to send an assassin to dispose of the enemy general, or assign archers to fend off the invaders from castle walls.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Solid Force</em> is a turn-based strategy game that casts the player in the role of Sho Masaki, a member of an organization known as \"Mars\". The group consists of highly trained agents and specializes in performing classified missions for various countries. Sho's first mission is to infiltrate a base in East Africa at the request of the African Federation.</p>\n<p>The game is composed out of large-scaled tactical battles. The player navigates the combatants over the screen and tries to accomplish missions without having the main hero killed. Most of the attacks in the game are ranged, and each weapon has unique properties. It is possible to choose full or spreading attacks with many firearms, throw bombs and use special abilities. Weapons have limited ammunition, and must be equipped manually before using. Powerful area attacks can be executed, but they damage everyone in the area, including player-controlled characters. Robot-like machines can be controlled directly by the player or set on auto mode.</p>",

The amount of moves is determined by dice roll. Special fields would award the character that lands on them with large amounts of money, the opportunity to roll the dice again, or lead to various mini-games which would increase the character's possessions.

        "description": "<p><em>Taiheiki</em> is a turn-based strategy game based on the Japanese 14th century historical epic of the same name. Like the book, the game portrays the struggle between the Northern Court, ruled by the decadent H\u014dj\u014d clan (later betrayed by their vassal Ashikaga Takauji), and the Southern Court of the emperor Go-Daigo. The gameplay has strong grand strategy elements and is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Koei\">Koei's</a> \"historical simulation\" series. The player can choose to control either the Northern or the Southern forces, choosing the actions for the leader and all his vassals. The player can choose to engage in diplomacy with rulers of other provinces, sign agreements, and manage and navigate armies. Combat takes place on a separate top-down grid, on which he player navigates the soldiers in turn-based fashion. Individual battles proceed automatically, their outcome based on the participant's attributes.</p>",

The game has three modes: exhibition, team management, and new player debut. Exhibition mode allows the player to select from a wide variety of wrestlers and compete in single, double, or tag-team (six wrestlers) fashions. New player debut puts the player in the role of popular wrestlers from the franchise, taking them through training sessions and a series of matches.</p>\n<p>Team management is the game's most expansive mode. In this mode, the player assumes the role of a manager who has to assemble a team of wrestlers to compete in Japanese regional leagues. New wrestlers can be picked from known athletes, or \"scouted\" on the street, with varied effects. The player then assigns schedules and activities for the wrestlers. It is possible to talk to them, send them on vacations, and also fire them. The player can also renovate the gym, design masks for the wrestlers, handle public relations, and perform other management duties. All these activities cost action points and have to be handled with care before the team is challenged for competition.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Harukanaru Kioku</em> is a re-imagining of earlier <em>Yami no Ketsuzoku</em> games. The basic plot follows the events that began in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/55025/yami-no-ketsuzoku/\">first installment</a>, but it is told in an entirely different fashion, with different scenes, dialogues, etc. For example, the game begins a short while before the starting point of the first chapter, and contains conversations between the protagonist Miyu Izawa and the murder victim Marie, which were not present in the original story. The visual style of the game is also quite different, with bright anime-like graphics atypical of the previous entries. </p>\n<p>Gameplay-wise, this installment also differs from the preceding computer games by greatly reducing interaction. All of the dialogue in the game is spoken, and much of the narration is revealed through Miyu's thoughts which act like cutscenes, rather than being derived from interaction with the environment. In essence, the game is a fairly linear visual novel with some occasions where the player is able to visit different locations.</p>",

His feelings hurt, the youth ventures to the United States, trying to earn enough money and participate in races to defend his national pride.</p>\n<p>The game is very similar to its predecessor in concept, but offers additional options in the story mode. Part-time jobs now include delivery assignments that play like overhead racing games, as well as tending to dogs of various breeds for money. The security guard assignment plays like a mini-RPG, complete with turn-based combat, experience points, and levels. In addition, it is possible to visit racing tracks and bet money on participants. The versus mode allows players to choose between three courses to compete in, racing against each other (in a top-down mode) or computer AI (first-person).</p>",

Depending on the player's skill, the woman will be photographed fully dressed, in revealing clothes, semi-naked, or as a skeleton</li>\n<li>A virtual tour through the Harajuku area in Tokyo, which includes dating a young woman by selecting locations to travel to from a map</li>\n<li>Another simple dating game, this time with an educational angle: the protagonist, aptly named Turbo Honda, meets a woman from New York and has to win her affection by selecting dialogue options in English</li>\n<li><em>Bombtown Story</em>, a digital comic taking place in an alternate universe reminiscent of \"film noir\" 1930's setting, but with all the characters being humanoid crocodiles. A love story develops as the player has to make a few decisions to affect the plot</li>\n<li>Another digital comic, describing an ordinary man's desire to succeed as a jockey; player's interaction is restricted to a few occasions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to games, the volume contains astrological speculations presented by a Japanese wrestler, a love horoscope, previews of upcoming PC Engine titles and a detailed catalogue of existing ones, a Japanese \"idol\" database, and a miscellaneous section with fan photos and drawings.</p>",

The protagonist in this chapter is a young man named Gilbert, who meets Royce and his daughter on his journey. The number of full-screen cutscenes has been greatly reduced, and the gameplay expanded to resemble a Japanese-style adventure with menu-based verb-object commands</li>\n<li>The wrestler <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/661112/masao-kimura/\">Rusher Kimura</a> returns with his zodiac horoscope, which this time contains within a monopoly-like board game for up to four players. Players select wrestlers with different statistics and navigate them on a board with dice rolls. Various encounters alter their attributes and wealth, and some lead to battles, which involve selecting cards with attack and defense ratings written on them; having a higher rating results in inflicting damage on the opponent</li>\n<li>In the dating game <em>UB Club</em> the player meets a young woman on a party, and has to select the right conversation choices in order to raise her \"love meter\" and successfully conclude the romance</li>\n<li><em>Making of Dorayaki Quest</em> is a simple game with humorous overtones, in which the player has to make the correct decisions in order to successfully produce a video game.</li>\n<li><em>Reverse 3</em> is a puzzle game. Red and blue squares appear on a board, and the player has to flip them in order to make adjacent squares change the color. The goal is to change all of the squares to the same color. Three stages of different sizes are included.</li>\n<li>Princess of PC Engine contains information about female characters from PC Engine games, e.g. the heroines of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Valis\">Valis</a> series, Saya from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=cosmic+fantasy\">Cosmic Fantasy</a>, Tsunade from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/15968/tengai-makyo-ziria/\">Tengai Maky\u014d: Ziria</a>, and others. This section also includes a sliding puzzle, a slot machine game (leading to another database in case of success), and a quiz that measures the player's affinities with the characters</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Like in the previous installment, a detailed PC Engine game catalogue (with previews) and a section containing fan photography and drawings is includes.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The fourth installment of the CD ROM game magazine series contains the following mini-games:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The retro sci-fi tale with minimalistic Japanese-style adventure gameplay, <em>Cusuto</em>, continues, as Royce E. Grant, his daughter, and Gilbert are searching for the mystical alien heritage, trying to evade the hostile military forces</li>\n<li><em>Fone</em> is a simple top-down role-playing game in Japanese style. The player controls a party of three characters, who are sent by the king to vanquish a newly reborn evil with the titular magic power. Automatic leveling up, equipment, random enemies, and first-person-view turn-based combat are all present.</li>\n<li>The dating game is this time set in the Edo period of the Japanese history, and has somewhat more extensive gameplay with location and conversation choices. The goal is the same as before: raise the \"love meter\" of a woman in order to fulfill a romance</li>\n<li><em>Nobunaga no Yar\u014d</em> (which can be translated as \"The Jerk Nobunaga\"; an obvious pun on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5825/nobunagas-ambition/\">Nobunaga no Yab\u014d</a>) is a puzzle game very similar to <em>UB64</em> from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/55085/ultrabox/\">first volume</a>. The player has to move soldiers on a field in a checkers-like pattern (jumping over other soldiers diagonally) to make an army advance</li>\n<li>A jumping rope game in which the player has to press a button at the correct time so that the girl won't trip on the rope. A bird is flying above the girl's head, dropping what appears to be excrements on her; if she is hit by those, the amount of rope-skipping needed to complete the stage increases. To avoid this predicament, the player can also press directional buttons to move the girl around. When on the ground, the unsavory objects turn into power-ups. The girl removes an item of her clothes after each successfully completed level, until she begins to jump naked</li>\n<li>A simple stationary first-person shooter game, in which the player has to shoot a young woman who is trying to capture various wild animals. Shooting the animals, on the other hand, gradually leads to a Game Over. The woman undresses after each level.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Like in the previous volumes, a detailed database of PC Engine games is included along with previous of upcoming releases. Miscellaneous section now also includes short digital comics along with pictures and other information.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Eple is a young girl donning a penguin costume, who lives in a secluded village in a snowy region of Northern Japan with other humans and birds. One day, following a monster attack on the village, Eple and her penguin friend fell into the water and drifted to faraway lands. The duo must face fearsome enemies and dangers to find a way back home.</p>\n<p><em>Travel Eple</em> is a top-down action game similar in concept to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Bomberman\">Bomberman</a>. The game is divided into stages, each consisting of one screen. Every stage has an opponent who tries to kill Eple either by attacking directly (most regular enemies only have close-range attacks, but bosses may not follow this rule), or by throwing objects at her. Eple, on the other hand, has no attacks on her own and must rely on these objects (mostly explosives such as bombs and grenades) to hurt the enemy. Objects keep appearing randomly in various parts of the screen as long as the battle continues.</p>\n<p>Stages may contain hazardous areas that damage Eple, or other spots that prevent her from walking around normally. Health-restoring pots also pop up from time to time. A few stages require Eple to access a magic staff, which grants her various protective abilities (e.g. an ice force field that absorbs fire damage). </p>\n<p>A versus mode is available, in which players compete against each other by controlling Eple and her friend Pal. Their magical abilities can be customized before the battle begins.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Yami no Ry\u016b Kishi</em> is a Japanese-style role-playing game based on the setting and themes of the card game <em>Monster Maker</em> and its subsequent table RPG incarnation. The player takes control of a young girl named Raia, who finds out that she belongs to the race of half-elves. Blamed for attacks on her village, she is expelled from her homeland and sets off on a journey to find out the truth about her origins.</p>\n<p>The game follows the traditional template of the genre and has top-down overworld navigation, towns and dungeons, party management, simple leveling-up, weapons and armor to equip, and randomly appearing enemies that engage the party in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Magic can be bought in shops, though some characters come with pre-learned spells. Later in the game the player gains the ability to communicate with monsters and summon them during battles.</p>",

It became increasingly hard to maintain them, and special robots known as \"Bidroids\" were invented to do the hard work. However, the colonies began waging war on each other, and Bidroids were used for military purposes. When peace was finally achieved, the leaders decided that Bidroids could continue functioning as combat machines, but in friendly championships rather than in deadly wars. </p>\n<p><em>Hyper Wars</em> is primarily a managerial simulation; robot combat itself is calculated depending on how the player created and maintained his or her robots. The player controls a manager of a team which competes in a league, complete with schedules, stadiums, etc. The player is given an initial budget with which he or she is able to create the first robot models and train them. Each robot can be created by merging together various parts (\"human\", \"beast\", \"bird\", and so on). After creation, it is necessary to outfit the robot with weapons and upgrade its parameters by paying for training. When the player feels ready, the robots can be taken to combat arenas and participate in the tournament.</p>",

The evil alien Dora and his sexy female demonic minions are descending on Earth, sending their subordinates to stop Divan and Marie. Divan must use his robot transformation abilities to defeat them, which can only be done when playing mahjong.</p>\n<p>The mahjong gameplay in this installment of the series is identical to that of its predecessor, including points distribution and execution of powerful transformation moves to gain the upper hand in the round. Unlike the previous games in the series, this chapter eschews the rudimentary adventure gameplay, featuring long non-interactive cutscenes between mahjong matches. Another change is the addition of a new mode that allows the player to compete against opponents from the story mode at any time, without going through the story.</p>",

Three cosmic spirits have lost their way in space and have to descend onto Earth, taking corporeal form. They enter the bodies of three young women who died recently: one in a traffic accident, another from disease, and the third one - a ten-year-old girl - after committing suicide. All three were avid mahjong players, and all three are now revived and endowed with mysterious mahjong powers. A special Mahjong Academy opens, and the Saver Angels (as the group begins calling itself) is ready to defeat any aliens and demons in that ancient Chinese game.</p>\n<p><em>Saver Angels</em> restores adventure elements that were absent from the previous game, and even enhances them. The player is now able to move in first-person perspective by pointing and clicking on a spot on the screen. Exploring locations, the player triggers scenes, which in turn lead to mahjong games. A special \"mahjong mode\" allows the player to choose an opponent from the story mode and challenge her (or him) to a mahjong match right away.</p>",

The player controls a school principal who brings female students to the hospital to do some tests. The player can then select various hospital rooms on a map; traveling to these locations triggers short conversations, which invariably lead to mahjong games against nurses, schoolgirls, patients, etc. A separate game mode is available, allowing the player to directly compete in mahjong against opponents from the story mode.</p>",

The player character can be navigated on a top-down map, accessing locations that lead to semi-random encounters with girls and subsequent mahjong games. Winning these games unlocks new locations and allows purchase of items that can be used during the encounters to the player's advantage. In the versus mode the player can directly compete against any of the girls; however, this mode contains only mahjong matches themselves, without any graphical indication as to which opponent the player character is facing.</p>",

The game puts the player in the role of Shoma, a new exchange student who meets Yohko and her best friend Chikako at his new school. Miraculously, the three are teleported into a parallel dimension, and the reluctant hero discovers, to his amazement, that its inhabitants seem to be familiar with him.</p>\n<p>The game plays like a typical Japanese-style adventure, with a menu of verb commands (Look, Talk, Think, and Move) at nearly every screen, some leading to object lists. It is often necessary to go through the commands several times to unlock a new one or trigger events. Limited menu-based navigation is also present.</p>",

Yohko, Shoma and Setsuna are attacked by demons on the flying ship, and have to use their recently found powers to fend them off. As opposed to the previous game, where Shoma was the protagonist, Yohko is the player character in the sequel.</p>\n<p>Gameplay-wise, the puzzle-less Japanese adventure format is further utilized. Verb commands must be selected from a menu and sometimes combined with objects or character names for interaction. It is often necessary to repeat commands several times to trigger the next event.</p>",

There are three cases in the game, all accessible from the main menu: two murders (the victims being young women), and one case of missing money. Up to four human- or AI-controlled characters are trying to solve these mysteries.</p>\n<p>Players navigate the characters in a turn-based fashion on a board representing an urban environment. The amount of steps taken by each character is determined by a dice roll, but the board consists of many branching paths, and it's up to the players to choose the desired ones. Characters can question suspects, gather clues and collect information when they land on appropriate squares on the board. Special squares procure cards, which can be used for various purposes, e.g. examine a piece of evidence, take a taxi to another place in the city, etc.</p>",

Gameplay-wise, however, this installment is quite different: it is a board game in which the player navigates a character by throwing dice to determine the number of moves. Like in other games of this genre, some fields bestow benefits on the player (e.g. award him money or items, invite the player to participate in bonus games, etc.). Most fields, however, lead to mahjong rounds against digitized young women, which have to be won in order to advance. Photos of scantily clad women in seductive poses serve as a reward for victory. A four-player mahjong mode is also available.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Tadaima Y\u016bsha Bosh\u016bch\u016b</em> is a semi-humorous title that incorporates elements of role-playing and strategy board game. The game is set in a medieval fantasy land populated by various races; when the country is overrun by demonic invaders, the king cowardly avoids responsibility and puts the task of liberating it into the hands of a group of heroes. Four players (human or AI-controlled) select their characters, each representing an exotic race, and take them on a quest to free the land.</p>\n<p>Navigation is done in a board game style; each of the players rolls dice, which determines the amount of moves the character can make. Characters belong to different classes and have unique attributes, abilities, hit and magic points, etc. In towns the characters can rest, purchase magic spells of various levels and elemental disciplines, buy items, and hire companions in bars. These companions also come in many varieties (magic users, monks, barbarians, etc.), and it is necessary to create a balanced party with spellcasters, healers and physically tough characters to prevail.</p>\n<p>Fields the characters land on may lead to random events such as stats and money increase, as well as battles. The latter are handled in traditional Japanese-style, turn-based RPG fashion, viewed from a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Final+Fantasy\">Final Fantasy</a>-like perspective. The player inputs commands (attack, magic, item, etc.) until the enemies are defeated, at which point battle spoils are acquired. Towns are often overrun by tougher enemies and can be liberated by vanquishing them. Should two player-controlled parties meet each other on the same field, they can opt to fight each other.</p>",

In the early 21th century humanity discovered a race of bug-like aliens while colonizing known space. The aliens steadily advance towards the Earth with the goal of eradicating it. To counter that, humans have developed giant mechas that ca be navigated by trained pilots. The story of the game follows closely the first chapter of the anime, focusing on the young pilot Noriko Takaya and her first steps towards the mastery of her dangerous profession.</p>\n<p>The game has a Japanese-style adventure-like interface (with Look, Talk, and other verb commands leading to sub-menus), but plays more like a cross between an interactive movie (with animated scenes and voice-overs) and a visual novel, where choices of actions and responses play a dominant role. Every wrong action raises the heroine's \"stress meter\"; once it is full, the game is over.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Top o Nerae! GunBuster Vol.2</em> is a direct sequel to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/55433/top-o-nerae-gunbuster-vol1/\">first episode</a> based on the <em>Gunbuster</em> anime series. It continues the story started in the first chapter, following the adventures of the young mecha pilot Noriko Takaya as she passes the test and is admitted into the fighting squad of mechas, sent on a mission to stop an insectoid race of aliens from destroying the Earth.</p>\n<p>Gameplay-wise, the second episode differs from the previous one in that it eschews even the rudimentary Japanese-style adventure commands. It plays more like a pure interactive movie: the player watches animated, voiced scenes and from time to time has to make a decision for Noriko, influencing subsequent scenes. The \"stress meter\" from the preceding game has been removed as well. The game also contains extras such as character and robot introduction, a radio drama, and a \"rock-paper-scissors\" game against Noriko.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Uch\u016b Senkan Yamato</em> is based on the anime series <em>Space Battleship Yamato</em>, also known as <em>Star Blazers</em>. The events of the game follow those of the initial episodes. In the end of the 22nd century, Gamila aliens bombard Earth with radioactive meteorites. As a result, the planet's surface becomes uninhabitable, and humans begin to dwell underground. Using the ruins of the World War II Japanese battleship Yamato, humans construct a powerful spaceship and can finally engage the aliens in direct confrontation.</p>\n<p>This incarnation of the series is essentially a real-time strategy game with a somewhat unusual approach to the genre. Rather than navigating units on battlefields, the player takes direct control of every crew member onboard the ship. Each one of them is responsible for a certain function (supplying power, manning a gun, turning the ship, etc.); in order to win battles, it is crucial to coordinate their actions. The game proceeds in real time, but pauses when the player accesses crew members and performs actions for them.</p>",

Yoko decides to stay and help the authorities investigate the crime.</p>\n<p>The game plays like a puzzle-less Japanese-style adventure. Most of the time the player chooses a location to travel to and interrogates characters, selecting various topics from a list. Such scenes are presented in first-person view. A few segments, however, feature third-person navigation with point-and-click interaction, similar to Western adventures. Other instances require the player to move a cursor on a zoomed object to interact with it in a detailed way.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Asano family possessed a heirloom known as the Sorcerer's Trump. In the year 1984, however, it was stolen under mysterious circumstances. Seventeen years later, Sayaka, the young heiress of the Asano family, forms a group together with her friends Miki and Kyoko, and the three begin looking for the lost treasure. Heist after heist goes by unsuccessfully. Eventually, the girls organize a TV show, challenging dubious personalities to card games, hoping to find the Sorcerer's Trump in process.</p>\n<p><em>Cardangels</em> is a card game in which the player takes the roles of the three friends, playing cards against young, attractive female opponents. Four types of card games are available: poker, blackjack, speed, and babanuki (a variant of old maid). A slot machine-like introduction determines which games are played against which opponents. The player can select the amount of rounds (minimum ten) needed to win a game and advance to the next opponent. The \"free play\" mode allows the player to choose the type of game actively, but the amount of available opponents is lower. There is no gambling in any of the games; points are awarded for combinations in poker and blackjack. The opponents undress after losing a game; however, they retain their underwear - there is no explicit nudity in the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Macross 2036</em> is a horizontally scrolling shooter set in the universe of the <em>Macross</em> anime series. The player takes control of one of the series' minor characters, the female pilot Mylene Jenius, who navigates the space fighter Veritech, fighting against ships and robotic soldiers of the alien Zentradi race. The player-controlled space ship is equipped with a vulcan gun (which can be upgraded with power-ups) and bombs, which are released simultaneously. Another button controls a special weapon, which the player can purchase for points (awarded for defeating enemies) between stages.</p>\n<p>The game's stand-out feature are separate boss battles which usually occur after a \"regular\" boss battle that concludes a flying level. After that battle, the Veritech automatically transforms into a giant mecha called Battroid, and fights a boss enemy one-on-one. The mecha fires automatically, and the player only controls its altitude and the angle of the shot. Anime-style cutscenes advance the plot between missions.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Eien no Love Song</em> is a turn-based strategy game set in the universe of the anime series <em>Macross</em>. The game focuses on the series' central plot: humanity's battle against the giant humanoid Zentradi aliens. Game progression is linear and mission-based; each mission is a tactical battle that takes place on a top-down screen. Goals and conditions of a mission may vary, though usually elimination of all enemies is required. </p>\n<p>The player controls various pilots, most notably Kiryu and his companion, a young woman named Retorade. Most pilots navigate space ships that can also transform into a mecha form. Both player-controlled and alien units are equipped with weapons that have different ranges and damage parameters. certain types of ships and mechas also have special abilities, such as healing. Battles between units flow automatically and are shown as animated scenes on separate screens.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Color Wars</em> is a puzzle game in which up to four players try to win by putting colored balls on poles, converting adjacent balls to their color. Each stage consists of a rotatable 3D screen containing a number of poles of the same height. Players take turns in placing balls onto these poles. Adjacent balls (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) can be \"captured\" and hence change their color. Points are awarded per ball of each color. The round ends when there is no more place on the poles to put balls onto, and the player with the most points wins.</p>\n<p>The story mode begins with an introduction depicting a powerful demon that can only be vanquished by traveling to the Color World; a young pilot ventures there and must defeat opponents in the Color Wars game at each stage. This mode puts one player against three AI-controlled opponents; the free mode also allows four human players to compete against each other. Two-player mode can be played by either two human players or one player against computer AI.</p>",

The player takes control of one of such convicts, Shunsuke Sengoku, the main protagonist of the anime. He must find his companions, the blind ex-boxer and hacker Gogol, and the effeminate Benten, in order to complete an assignment given to him by the police and eventually lower his sentence in prison.</p>\n<p>The game contains first-person screens with typical Japanese-style menu-based verb-object interaction during dialogues; however, most of the exploration in the game is done in third person, as Sengoku explores top-down areas, talking to people and gathering information and clues. There are no real puzzles in the game, but in some situations inventory items can be used or shown to characters.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Feed Sluster is a fiend hunter: a man who takes job that involves elimination of mysterious beings known as fiends. One day he is contacted by a woman named Beth, who offers him a more demanding job, which involves investigating shady activities between humans and fiends, and getting to the bottom of the entire mystery, discovering the origin of the fiends and determine their ultimate fate.</p>\n<p><em>Fiend Hunter</em> is a cinematic platformer set in an Old West-like environment with supernatural elements. With the exception of the initial town and a few other locations, the game is spent in areas that require carefully navigating Feed through a series of platform-like structures. Controls and animation resemble those of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/196/prince-of-persia/\">Prince of Persia</a>. Feed can jump, run, perform a running jump, hang on ledges, pull up or drop down, kneel and crawl. He also takes falling damage; the primary challenge during platforming sequences consists of preventing him from falling down.</p>\n<p>Enemies only appear at pre-set points; each battle is one-on-one, and it is impossible to escape from a fight. Coupled with the enemies' high HP count and varied attack patterns, this essentially turns each encounter into a boss battle. Feed fights with a sword and can perform various moves, combining attacks with jumping and ducking. He can also gain access to a few magic spells.</p>\n<p>A little fire fiend named Exy accompanies Feed on his journey. Exy can be used as offensive and defensive enhancement in combat, and can also be set to light dark areas. Each enemy drops a special orb that can be used to increase Feed's vitality, attack power, or magic, as well as teach Exy more powerful attacks, which gives the game a light RPG flavor. Feed can also equip rings and buy or find health-restoring and protective potions.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Fushigi no Umi no Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water</em> is one of the several games based on the anime series of the same name. The game assumes familiarity with the story of the anime, taking the player directly into the time frame of late episodes, where Grandis and the jewel thieves have already joined Jean and Nadia on their travels with Captain Nemo on his submarine \"Nautilus\". Following a dramatic scene that reveals more about Electra's past, the crew is stranded on a mysterious island. Jean, Nadia, Marie, and the lion cub King decide to explore it, and discover an ancient civilization in the process.</p>\n<p>The game plays mostly like an interactive comic book or a visual novel, though it does contain adventure elements such as verb commands. However, these commands are usually very sparse, and there are no sub-menus with objects or people to interact with. The game advances linearly, and the player's input is for the most part reduced to choosing between several locations to explore first. There is also a separate quiz mode where the player answers trivia questions asked by characters from the series.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the future, time travel became a regular commodity. Criminal organizations began using advanced science in order to escape into different time periods to avoid capture. To counter that, a special police unit called \"Burning Rabbits\" was formed, consisting of four young ladies who bravely pilot their fighter craft through time and space.</p>\n<p><em>Ginga Fukei Densetsu: Sapphire</em> is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up. The player can choose between four different female characters, each piloting a different ship: Sapphire has balanced strength is speed; Charlotte is the fastest, but also the weakest; Helen is the slowest and the strongest; Jasmine is the second-strongest and the second-slowest. The ships are also distinguished by their weapon properties. Each ship can collect red, green, or blue power-ups; collecting a power-up of the same color enhances the currently equipped weapon, while a differently-colored power-up changes weapon properties while retaining whatever enhancements the ship might have had with the previous weapon. The actual properties of each weapon is different for each ship, and include various combinations of lasers, beams, missiles, piercing and homing weapons.</p>\n<p>Each ship also has two pods on the sides that fire simultaneously. If the player releases the fire button for five seconds, the pods will charge up and damage enemies with electricity during the next shot. In additions, the ships can also drop bombs that heavily damage all the enemies on the screen; up to two bombs can be carried at the same time. The stages include various themes such as medieval, feudal China, ancient Egypt, etc., all with a strong sci-fi angle. The player can continue up to nine times from the same spot if the protagonist runs out of lives, and additional continues are granted when the player gathers a sufficient amount of points.</p>",

However, following a breakthrough discovery, Steiner mysteriously disappears. His daughter Chris travels to Central America in search of her father, and steps into an intimidating world of monsters and conspiracies.</p>\n<p><em>Hih\u014d Densetsu: Chris no B\u014dken</em> is a platformer. Chris is armed with a dagger and cannot use any other weapons or gadgets to protect herself. However, the dagger can be upgraded by collecting colored orbs dropped by enemies. Depending on their combination, the dagger can be used as a long-ranged weapon, firing projectiles or acting as a boomerang. The protagonist's health is measured with hearts; a stage must be restarted if Chris runs out of all five of them. Enemies would sometimes leave hearts and coins behind; the latter add an extra life to Chris if she collects a sufficient amount. </p>\n<p>A boss enemy awaits at the end of every second stage. Other features include moving and disappearing platforms, deadly traps such as spikes, mine cart-riding, and a strict time limit for each stage. The story is advanced through anime-style cutscenes between stages.</p>",

Demons have attacked a lovely floating island, defeated its guardian, and stole the crystals that protected it. Two young magicians, Anis and Lester, decide to put an end to monster invasion. Players can choose to control either of them in single-player mode, or join forces in co-op gameplay. </p>\n<p>Like in <em>Bubble Bobble</em>, the goal is to eliminate all the enemies on screen by turning them into bubbles; this is achieved by shooting projectiles at them from a magic wand. These bubbles can be destroyed with the wand or thrown at each other for a more effective result. Each monster, however, turns into a bubble of a particular color, and making two bubbles of the same color touch each other releases the trapped monsters. If it takes the player too long to kill all the enemies, tougher ones will appear on screen. The game consists of six worlds, each comprising nine regular and one boss stage.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Power Golf 2: Golfer</em> is a follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/46295/power-golf/\">Power Golf</a>. The game attempts to realistically simulate golf and contains many features and variables that influence gameplay. There are two modes in the game: Normal and Tournament. In the normal mode up to four players can compete against each other or computer opponent in stroke play, match play, driving range, and putting green. Real Japanese golf courses are available for selection, complete with digitized photos and introductions. The player can select to control Japanese golfers and choose between a variety of clubs, as well as manually influence the shot, controlling force, angle, and the exact part of the ball the player wishes to strike.</p>\n<p>The Tournament mode is essentially a managerial simulation game. The player takes control of a golfer in an unnamed city. The goal is to accumulate enough currency and fame, as well as increase personal attributes of the golfer in order to participate in tournaments. Currency is obtained by doing part-time jobs, e.g. as a caddie in golf matches, or by gambling at slot machines. The player can also visit shops to purchase clubs and other golfing equipment. There is an in-game schedule that keeps track of tournaments and also incorporates random events (such as accidents). It is also possible to send the golfer on a vacation when he is too tired from working or practicing golf.</p>",

Suddenly, the singer was caught in a whirlwind and disappeared. The hero bravely followed her into a magical alternate dimension, but ended up in a forest, unable to find her. He must now find NORI-P and defeat an evil magician in the process.</p>\n<p><em>Kagami no Kuni no Legend</em> is a Japanese-style first-person adventure game. The player interacts with the game world by selecting verb commands from a menu and combining them with objects or characters. Commands such as \"Examine\" or \"Talk\" appear at most screens; if an object can be taken, an appropriate command is displayed after the player has thoroughly examined a location. There is also an inventory with items that must be used at specific moments; however, there are no real puzzles in the game. Navigation is done by selecting the \"Move\" command; in a few locations the player navigates the hero with directional buttons in a pseudo-3D environment. Wrong choices may sometimes lead to a Game Over.</p>\n<p>Most of the background and character graphics is done in anime style, with the exception of Noriko herself, who appears in digital photos, sometimes accompanied by song performances.</p>",

The brave young ninja Kaze is summoned by Lord Yoshikage and sent on a dangerous mission: infiltrate Hiei's castle, defeat his minions, and rescue Shizuhime.</p>\n<p><em>Kaze Kiri</em> is essentially a beat-em-up with a few distinguishing characteristics. The game consists of traversing fully linear side-scrolling areas, defeating regular enemies and bosses on the way. Before being able to fight the stage boss, Kaze has to vanquish a pre-determined number of enemies, which is displayed as a shared enemy HP on top of the screen.</p>\n<p>Kaze attacks with his sword when he is near the enemy, or throws shurikens at them from afar. Enemy projectiles can also be blocked by countering them with shurikens. Kaze can also disappear for a moment and re-appear at another location. He can jump, duck, perform somersaults, and grab and throw enemies. Kaze's health regenerates over time if he is not hit repeatedly. Completing the game unlocks another playable character, the female ninja Suzu.</p>",

A special giant mecha fighter craft was constructed in order to avert the threat. A young pilot is sent on the most dangerous mission of his life.</p>\n<p><em>Kiaidan 00</em> is a horizontally scrolling sci-fi shoot-em-up. The basic gameplay is similar to other games of this genre; however, the weapon system differs from the traditional power-up and upgrade style. The player character has all the weapons at his disposal from the very beginning. The five weapons include spreading energy blasts, focused multiple shot, laser beams that travel in different directions, an energy ball that protects the ship from frontal assaults, and an extended arm that hits enemies melee-style. The player can cycle through and choose any of these weapons at any time. </p>\n<p>Instead of the traditional secondary weapon system the game offers charged modes for all the weapons. When a weapon is charged it either becomes more powerful or gains new properties (for example, the extended arm becomes longer and is controlled from a distance). The player character's health is represented by shield units, which can also be picked up in the stages. Dialogue and cutscenes advance the story between and within missions.</p>",

In the near future, officers of Tokyo Metropolitan Police pilot giant robots called \"Labors\" to combat criminals. Like most installments of the anime and manga, the game focuses on characters from Special Vehicle Section 2, Division 2, and the playable character is Noa Izumi. More specifically, the game follows the so-called \"TV timeline\", involving the Labor Griffon.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is that of a traditional Japanese-style adventure. Three commands \u2014 Look, Talk, and Move \u2014 appear on every screen. The player selects these commands (there are no sub-menus with objects) to move between locations, examine rooms, talk to characters, and ultimately advance the storyline. The game also contains a variety of features (robot database, interviews with voice actors, etc.) accessible from the main menu, as well as a rock-paper-scissors mini-game starring various Labors.</p>",

A young woman named Erena is persecuted by the militant Hielun Empire, who pursues its own agenda and is convinced that Erena has a mysterious connection to the demon's powers. However, a knight named Vaice and his friends rescue Erena and prepare to defend her, gradually becoming involved in a large-scale armed conflict. </p>\n<p><em>Kis\u014d Louga</em> is a turn-based strategy game. The gameplay consists entirely of battles, with anime-style cutscenes advancing the story between missions. The player navigates individual characters in an overhead locations. A contact with an enemy unit initiates a separate battle, where the player selects commands (Attack, Item, Special, etc.) from a menu. </p>\n<p>Castles play an important role during battles: characters can retreat and heal in a player-controlled castle, and conquering an enemy castle is often required as well as part of the mission's objective. Castles may be defended by arches, catapults, etc., and their gates must be destroyed by attacking them. Missions often involve battles between multiple sides. Despite the RPG-like menus, individual statistics, and equipment management, there are no real role-playing elements in the game, since characters do not level up or become stronger in another fashion.</p>",

The player takes control of a coach who must train five young women of different backgrounds, all of which aspire to become a professional fighter. The coach's statistics are generated by answering a series of questions in the beginning of the game. Each of the girl also has her own statistics that must be carefully monitored. With the exception of automatized events, the game consists of creating schedules for all the girls for one week in advance, and then watching how their attributes change. Activities include battle training, gymnastics, running, resting, etc. All the activities are displayed as small animated segments on the same screen.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/57124/metal-angel/\">Metal Angel</a> is, like its predecessor, a managerial simulation in which the player character trains young girls to become champions of a fighting championship where participants don mechanized power suits. The player controls a manager rather than a coach in this installment, and must keep an eye on the finances as a result. Also, instead of training all the five girls from the first game, the player's answers to the questions posed by the assistant in the beginning of the game determine the choice of the trainee among the same five characters.</p>\n<p>The player must make schedules for the fighter, which include various training and recreational activities. The manager can hire coaches with their own programs, or input activities individually. The battles themselves allow little input, with the player being able to choose between various types of attacks by selecting them from a menu; the outcome of the battle largely depends on training and individual statistics.</p>",

In 2008, a devastating war between two super-powers led to a nearly complete destruction of the Earth. The continents sunk into the oceans, and only a few islands remained. Conan is a boy who grew up on one of those islands, a descendant of one of the survivors of a spaceship crash. He meets a girl named Lana, who later gets kidnapped by soldiers of Industria, a developed island with centralized administration. Conan travels to Industria and is determined to rescue Lana, uncovering a much greater conspiracy in the process.</p>\n<p>The game plays like a fairly traditional platformer taking place in predominantly maze-like environments connected by exit areas. Conan can jump, duck, and fight enemies with his fists. He can also use a limited numbers of ranged weapons such as spears.</p>",

The Kingdom of Rida was conquered. The young royal guard Biares fought valiantly, but was unable to defeat his mysterious opponent in mahjong. He was teleported far away, and found by a girl named Olivie. Biares has to find a way to return to Rida and liberate his country from invaders, finding companions and playing mahjong on the way.</p>\n<p><em>Seisenshi Densh\u014d: Jantaku no Kishi</em> is a mahjong game. The story mode features extensive cutscenes and dialogue between mahjong matches. Mahjong gameplay itself is of the one-on-one variety; a few rules regarding combinations and bonuses can be customized. The free mode allows the player to match Biares against various characters encountered in the story mode.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Tenka wa Ware ni</em> is based on the <em>Sangokushi</em> manga by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/1302273/mitsuteru-yokoyama/\">Mitsuteru Yokoyama</a>, itself an adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/514592/eiji-yoshikawa/\">Eiji Yoshikawa's</a> re-telling of the classic Chinese novel <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em> by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/1148439/luo-guanzhong/\">Luo Guanzhong</a>. As such, the game includes plot elements and a few characters added by Yoshikawa or Yokoyama, but for the most part remains faithful to the general storyline of the Chinese novel and hence to the actual historical events of the Three Kingdoms Era.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is similar to that of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=koei\">Koei's</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=romance+of+the+three+kingdoms\">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a> series, focusing on grand strategy and country management as well as on tactical battles. There is no scenario selection, but the player can choose between multiple warlords of the three kingdoms. The player then manages the province under control of the selected warlord. It is necessary to take care of the population and army, buying provisions, training officers, and publishing edicts. Diplomacy plays an important role: pacts and agreements can be made, and it is also possible to acquire new allies through various means.</p>\n<p>Invading (or being attacked by) another country leads to a large-scale tactical battle that takes place on hexagonal grids. The player navigates army divisions in turn-based fashion. Contact with an enemy division leads to yet another sub-mode, where the player controls units that form the division, positioning and navigating them on a smaller battle screen. The game also has a separate battle mode accessible from the main menu, where the player can recreate historical battles directly without going through grand strategy portions.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Alzadick</em> is a vertically-scrolling sci-fi shoot-em-up designed for Naxat Soft's <em>Summer Carnival</em> of 1992, a game competition similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Hudson+Soft\">Hudson's</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=caravan+Tournament\">Caravan Tournament</a>. The game specifically focuses on beating high scores, and as such introduces Score Attack and Time Attack modes, both short segments of shoot-em-up gameplay that challenge players to reach a high score (in case of Time Attack, within a limited amount of time). There is also a story mode split into two episodes (both based on sci-fi-themed futuristic scenarios); however, there is no actual plot development in-game, and the episodes are very short compared to standard-length shooters.</p>\n<p>Like in most games of the kind, the player controls a spaceship and tries to eliminate or avoid on-screen enemies. Power-ups take the shape of the letters A, B, C, and D; each corresponds to a weapon of specific color and properties (e.g. spreading fire, side fire, etc.), though they are fairly similar to each other in function. A powerful sub-weapon that hits all enemies on screen comes in four variants and can only be used once.</p>",

The regular mode introduces familiar regular enemies and a few new bosses. The \"Carnival Mode\" contains Score Attack and Time Attack modes, both requiring the player to focus on attaining the high score rather than just surviving. For that reason the difficulty in these modes is more forgiving; they allow more continues and have more generously placed power-ups. These modes also offer more destructible objects on the screen, as these specifically serve to increase the score.</p>",

The story is much more elaborate and character-specific; unlike the earlier game, there is a linear plot advanced through dialogue and anime-style cutscenes. The player takes control of Alcion, the crown prince of the Auraclume kingdom, who is forced to terminate his studies abroad and return to his country in order to defend it against a treacherous enemy.</p>\n<p>The gameplay system is vastly different as well; as opposed to the main entries in the series, <em>Super Schwarzschild</em> is not a grand strategy game. The gameplay is confined to much smaller areas and is also significantly more linear and mission-oriented. Rather than presenting free-form gameplay and interaction with a multitude of nations, the game is restricted to a single military conflict. Diplomacy options are completely gone; finances, resource management, and research have been simplified. Much of the game is dedicated to military strategy and tactics, involving arming and deploying ships. Battles are actively controlled by the player; they take place on separate small screens and require the player to navigate ships and attack enemy craft in turn-based fashion.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/57209/super-schwarzschild/\">Super Schwarzschild</a> offers an original scenario that takes place after the Great Somari War. Like other Schwarzschild games, it is set in the 40th century and portrays a complex political and military situation within a star system. The events of the game take place in or around the once powerful kingdom of Istramu, which was severely weakened by the king's death. Temporary leaders replaced each other, and the instability led to a global revolt in the surrounding space. The player takes the role of various characters belonging to the resistance movement.</p>\n<p>Like the previous game, <em>Super Schwarzschild</em> has less grand strategy elements than the main Schwarzschild installments, and focuses on smaller-scale military strategy and tactics. There are no diplomacy options; resource management and research are simplified. There are more belligerents and somewhat more freedom in strategic planning than in the preceding game. Battles take place on separate screens and follow a turn-based tactical model. Similarly to the predecessor, the game features extensive cutscenes and dialogue that advance the plot.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The TV Show</em> is a humorous overhead action game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Bomberman\">Bomberman</a> in concept. The game consists of a scenario mode (single-player) and a versus mode (up to four players). Both modes offer seven characters to choose from. The characters are comically-themed and include a hyperactive schoolgirl, an armored ninja, and others. There is no real storyline behind these characters; each comes with a short introduction sequence that invariably leads to their admittance to an alien-organized TV show, where they have to defeat enemies and retrieve prizes.</p>\n<p>Each stage is an overhead screen containing the protagonist, enemies, the prize, and several bombs. The bombs should be picked up and carried around; they are used to deal with enemies and blow up the receptacle in which the prize is contained. The green bombs change their color to yellow and red when picked up, at which point they are about to explode and have to be thrown to avoid damage. Bombs also blow holes in the terrain, and the player must pay attention not to fall through. In addition to bomb-carrying and bomb-throwing, each character possesses a special ability. These range from throwing projectiles at enemies to speeding up when driving a bike, depending on the selected character.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Urusei Yatsura: Stay with You</em> is based on the manga series by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/132555/rumiko-takahashi/\">Rumiko Takahashi</a>. The protagonist is Ataru Moroboshi, a high school student who accidentally evokes love in the heart of Lum, the princess of an alien demon-like race. The game does not recount the initial events of the manga and instead is built like an episode, assuming the player's familiarity with the general story and characters. Ataru's ex-girlfriend Shinobu disappears under mysterious circumstances. Ataru and Lum must explore the high school building and find out what happened to Shinobu.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is that of a traditional Japanese-style adventure, where all interaction (including navigation) is performed by selecting verb commands from a menu and combining them with objects from a list. game progression is fairly linear, and it is typically required to complete an objective in one location in order to be able to proceed to the next one. There are no real puzzles, but an inventory with items that can be examined is present.</p>",

This adaptation of the manga follows the \"Dark Tournament\" story arc, where members of Yusuke's team confront the powerful demon Toguro.</p>\n<p>Despite its premise, which is reminiscent of a versus fighting game, <em>Ankoku Bujutsukai</em> is an arcade-style shooter. The player selects one of the five characters (Yusuke, Hiei, Kurama, Kuwabara or Genkai), and is then taken to a series of one-on-one shoot-outs in a pre-determined order. The enemy is viewed from a first-person perspective, and the player moves a cursor to aim and shoot. The gameplay system is fairly simple, allowing the player to execute three types of attacks: regular shots, charged shots, and special attacks of limited quantity. Points are received for winning fights and can be used to raise the characters' hit points, speed, or number of special moves.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Implode</em> is a homebrew puzzle game. It plays like a falling block puzzle in all respects, with the exception of the fact that the blocks appear from below instead of falling. All the blocks have the same shape and are only distinguished by their color. The player must selects groups of three or more identically colored blocks in order to make them disappear. The goal is to not let the blocks stack up and pass the upper border of the screen. Bombs would sometimes appear and clear out adjacent blocks if the player selects them. The game gradually advances to higher difficulty levels, with more colors and faster speed.</p>\n<p>Also included on the CD are two games previously only released in downloadable emulation format: <em>Crash</em> and <em>Humpball</em>. The first is a single-screen overhead arcade racing game. Two cars race automatically on a maze-like screen in circular movement. Players must press directional buttons to switch between the tracks. The goal is to move over all the dots scattered in the stage while avoiding crashing into the other car. </p>\n<p><em>Humpball</em> can be described as a cross between <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pong\">Pong</a> and a volleyball game. Two hump-like creatures are positioning on either side of a pole, tossing a ball towards the opponent's side by moving to the sides and jumping. The goal is to make the ball touch the opponent's floor, which results in scoring a point. Power-ups that move the pole to left or right, change the speed of the ball, gravity rules, etc., appear randomly and are activated when touched by the ball.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Meteor Blaster DX</em> is a homebrew <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=asteroids\">Asteroids</a> variant. The player controls a spaceship navigated by an astronaut named Stryker, who is sent on a mission to destroy dangerous asteroids in space. There are four different ships to choose from, each with different power and speed ratings. The player can move the ship and rotate its cannon to shoot asteroids. Big and medium asteroids split in two when shot, and only when they are small they can be fully destroyed. A stage is completed when all the asteroids have been eliminated. All the stages take place on the same screen, but feature different enemies and difficulty level. </p>\n<p>The DX version is a physical release of a previous download-only version, and includes hostile UFOs that shoot at the player-controlled ship, boss battles, CD audio soundtrack, and power-ups that temporarily grant shields and other bonuses.</p>\n<p>Also included on the CD is a timed mode (\"Caravan Mode\") of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/57222/implode/\">Implode</a>, as well as the puzzle game <em>Loop</em>, which was previously only released in emulator-only downloadable format and requires the player to rotate and construct loops out of pipe pieces that gradually fill up the screen, making them disappear.</p>",

The disc contains two demo versions of previously released commercial games: <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/44113/fray-in-magical-adventure-cd-xak-gaiden/\">Fray in Magical Adventure CD: Xak Gaiden</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=popful+mail\">Popful Mail</a>. In addition, two homebrew games made with the PC Engine development kit Develo are included. <em>Frisbee Ken John</em> is a one-button game in which the player controls a dog who must jump and catch frisbee flying discs. <em>Speeder</em> is a simple racing game with third-person pseudo-3D view, where the player-controlled vehicle must stay on the road in order to survive.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Camp California</em> is the second and last game based on the short-lived multimedia property of the same name, featuring a group of anthropomorphic animals who are the official mascots of surf rock group The Beach Boys.</p>\n<p>In the game, the gnarly surfer dudes of the Camp California crew find that their favorite beach has been sold to a villain called the Big Cheese who plans to build a nuclear power plant in the area. The gang's plan: hold a benefit concert to raise enough money to buy back the beach. Unfortunately, the Big Cheese gets wind of the plan and sends his henchmen, the Ratz, to kidnap the crew, steal their instruments and take the tires off Woody, the gang's trusty vehicle. Luckily, Byron the bear was out surfing while this happened, and it now falls to him to rescue his friends and get back the tires and the instruments.</p>\n<p>The game is a side-scrolling platformer consisting of nine levels, with such areas as a beach, a junkyard, an amusement park, an army base and a mall. The levels are reached via an overview map of California that players drive along in Woody. To start the car, the tires must be found in the first level. All other levels then contain instruments or members of the crew to rescue. At the start, players can only control Byron, but once a new friend has been rescued, they can be selected to be played at the beginning of a level. All characters differ in abilities. Byron punches and kicks to defeat enemies while Lil' Bro (the star of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/17503/yo-bro/\">previous game</a>) uses his skateboard to skid or jump on top of the bad guys. Shred can turn into a tornado, Pouch headbutts and is also the only one who can swim underwater, and Scream'r uses a boomerang and is the only one who can fly.</p>\n<p>Besides many enemies (mostly the Ratz gang, but also robotic dogs and other critters) the levels include recyclables to pick up, like soda cans and banana peels. When a level is completed, the trash is converted into fuel for Woody. If the fuel runs out on the overview map, the car can only be restarted at the loss of a life.</p>\n<p>The game features voiced cutscenes and CD-quality background music, including three Beach Boys tracks: <em>Fun, Fun, Fun</em>, <em>I Get Around</em> and <em>Good Vibrations</em>.</p>",

Things such as making the interior of the mansion brighter for easier navigation, items are now more visible from farther away, and the biggest change being the game no longer erases the game save in the event of the party's death.</p>",

        "description": "<p><i>Mysterious Song</i> is an RPG strongly influenced by the style of the early Final Fantasy games. You control the knight Spear who is given a mission by king Algameth IX to investigate the increase of monsters ravaging his land. In his quest, Spear will have two companions who will fight alongside him. The combat is turn-based, with a simple magic system based on spell points. Tiger, one of the party members specializes in physical combat, while the other - Ryanna, is a mage. Spear is a more balanced character.</p>\n<p>In development for 7 years, the TurboGrafx CD version upgrades the visuals of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/81654/mysterious-song/\">original DOS version</a> and adds voice-acted cutscenes, CD music, a balanced mode which is less difficult to play than the original, as well as an armory, bestiary, concept art and an EX Game mode with a new storyline and gameplay elements which is unlocked after clearing the game in Original mode and acquiring Ogien, a fire elemental.</p>",
