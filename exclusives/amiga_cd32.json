Of course the nobles of the land aren't willing to give up their wealth, so this money must be obtained through tournaments, raids and outright battle against individual provinces. All of the nobles have castles, so at times siege equipment must be used.</p>\n<p><em>Defender of the Crown II</em> is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/181/defender-of-the-crown/\">Defender of the Crown</a>. It improves over the game by upgrading the arcade sequences. Here, unlike the original game; sword fighting is about method and is not just wild clicking of the mouse button. The siege sequence is also enhanced with different types of ammo (such as Greek fire) to toss into the castle. The jousting is now easier to control and the lance no longer bounces around wildly.</p>",

The back story revolves around a giant dreadnought attacking an unnamed planet. The player takes the role of the chosen hero and boards their flying saucer to eliminate the aliens called Sirians.</p>\n<p>The game is a horizontal scrolling shooter. After a wave of enemies is destroyed, they release a power-up token. Collecting it will advance the weapon select gauge by one step, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Gradius\">Gradius</a>. In this way, the weapon systems of the player's ship can be upgraded. If the player hits an enemy or a bullet, their energy bar is reduced. At the end of each level, a guardian awaits that needs to be destroyed in order to advance further in the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Final Gate</em> is a full motion video rail shooter. The player is seated in the front of a speedboat that is moving down a river. The boat is moving forward automatically and the player's input is limited to moving a crosshair over the video footage (which only takes up a quarter of the screen) and shoot at the projectiles that are launched towards the player's position. If they are not shot quickly enough the player takes damage and loses energy. Sometimes enemies will appear at the side of the riverbank and by shooting these a special video sequence will be shown. If not the player is likely to take a lot of damage. To regain some energy it is possible to shoot power ups that at times appear on the screen. When all out of energy one of three lives is lost.</p>",
