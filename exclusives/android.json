        "description": "<p>Here, the first \"adventure\" game continues to be ported to the latest and greatest platforms as a \"hello world\" exercise of sorts.  Not much has changed for this game in the past 35-odd years, so to briefly reiterate: the player directs the actions of a spelunking cave-adventurer through a primitive text parser, overcoming monsters, traps and strange obstacles with the use of handy inventory items and head-scratching magic words.  This version is a very faithful reproduction, maintaining the gold standard of 430 points to achieve after Don Woods had souped up Will Crowther's sun source.  Android being what it is, some relatively new functionality for this text adventure is the option of using speech synthesis and voice recognition to verbally spar with the game.</p>",

In this mobile puzzle game the player helps the ferryman to transport the souls of the dead over the river and into the kingdom of Hades. This is not as easy at it sounds since the river is full of barriers that block the path for the ferryman. The aim of the game is to clear a passage through the river so that the ferryman can row his boat from shore to shore. The gameplay works like a sliding puzzle, similar to the board game Rush Hour, and the player uses the touch screen to drag the barriers around the playing field. For each movement made the player has to pay a coin to Hades but for each completed level he is awarded 100 coins. After completing the game the player can compare his score to others on a global high score list.</p>",

Heroes of Zulula is a strategy RPG in which you control a ragtag band of ex-gladiators (tournaments are now banned) who seek to banish the evil Akolan from the city.  A lot of the character archetypes from Champions are back.  Like most strategy RPG you control armies on a strategic map in a turn-based fashion.  When units engage in combat, however, the game switches to a rather original combat mode.  The typical \"run towards my enemy, slash, return to starting position\" is replaced with a combat planning/strategy interface.  You deploy your troops and give them order, then you press play and watch the combat unfold in a sort of \"simulation\".</p>\n<p>Most of the characters are new and loosely based on their 1995 counterparts.  Emphasis is placed on the story, which has a \"Trailer Park Boys meet South Park\" sort of vibe.  So the typical medieval-fantasy bunch is replaced by a slow-poke cyclop, a french knight, a french-canadian slime (who only speaks pure Quebec joual, even in the english version), a chatroom l33t-speaking eye, a straight-man dog, an robotic stone golem, a run-of-the-mill mage and a mercenary snake.  The game was voluntarily rated \"Teen Content\" for Strong Language, Cartoon Violence, Crass Humour and Alcohol Use.  It is not for the easily offended.</p>\n<p>The game has 10 acts, there is a free ad-supported version and an ad-free version which has a few more features.  2 sequels are already planned.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Winds of Steel</em> is a game for the Android systems that places the player in a position of a pilot during the Second World War, in the campaign the player can choose between several battles such as \"Pearl Harbor\" or \"Tokyo\" where he has to complete his objectives in order to complete the mission, objectives are often standard ones like \"defend this area\", \"destroy that target\" or \"scan that zone\". Each mission has its own aircraft that belongs to either the Axis or the Allies forces, the player can not choose which faction to play as. At the end of the mission the player sees his score and he can then replay the mission at any time to see if he can beat his highest score. Beside a Campaign there is also an \"instant action\" mode where the player can choose an objective without any connection to a historic battle.</p>\n<p>The player controls the aircraft by tilting his phone like he is holding a steering wheel, this way the player can fly in any direction and change his altitude. To fire the player must touch the \"Fire\" button located on the right side of the screen, beneath the fire button is a button that allows the player to switch to his secondary weapons (this is almost always bombs), after switching the player can use his secondary weapon the same way he used his primary weapon. Some missions will start the player out on the ground and to start flying the player will have to touch the fire button to start his engines. If the player is fired at he will eventually lose control of his aircraft and crash, meaning that the mission has ended and that he has lost.</p>",

More often then not the player also has to complete a certain goal such as collecting a certain number of batteries.

        "description": "<p><em>Help Out</em> is based on the concept of the board game <em>Rush Hour</em>. It is a block sliding puzzle game where the player is presented with a board full of rectangular blocks. A certain number of these blocks should be removed from the board and to do this the player has to slide the blocks around so that a clear path is created. The player can customize the game with different themes that change the look of the game. When starting out there are three different themes to choose from, but as the player progresses through the game more are unlocked. The game feature hundreds of levels. By completing levels the player can earn achievements and bonuses (gems). If things get to tricky the game really can help out the player by showing the solution. This is however limited to once per every 30 minutes.</p>",

The game camera ensures that the player is always at the top of the screen and the planet seems to rotate underneath. After a missile is fired, the player is able to run back and forth to guide the missile to its target. There are two versions of the game.

        "description": "<p><em>GravBlocks</em> is, on the surface, a traditional match-three style puzzle game in a similar vein to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6024/tetris-attack/\">Tetris Attack</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Bejeweled\">Bejeweled</a>. In this sense, players simply switch blocks that are side-by-side either left or right. The main difference is a new focus and gimmick to the gameplay. Rather than building high scores by crafting combos when clearing blocks, <em>GravBlocks</em> focuses on strategic gameplay. The strategy comes in the form of Gravity Blocks in the play area. Players earn a score multiplier by aligning Gravity Blocks to change the gravity of the play area. The left-right block switching mechanic updates relative to gravity. For instance, when gravity is against the left wall of the play space, the switching mechanic feels more like \"up-down,\" but is really still \"left-right\" per the current gravity. Bomb blocks exist and when used, will clear all of one (or more, if used carefully) color of block from the play space.</p>\n<p>Changing gravity can be more challenging than it may seem. The walls of the play area are filled with potential hazards, and if even one block falls into the play area, the Multiplier is reset. Using rare Wild blocks, players can temporarily close hazards so that changing gravity can be performed safely. In this sense, players must be able to both act quickly when switching blocks, and be able to monitor and plan their strategies. In Intermediate and Advanced difficulties, the score multiplier can reach x10. </p>\n<p>This formula is then utilized in the game's four different modes. Challenge mode is a \"traditional\" Tetris-like endeavor, with blocks falling into the play space with gradually increasing numbers falling in. Players may choose from 30 difficulty levels, and the length of each level can be selected from 1 to 5 minutes with a goal of lasting as long as possible and building as big a score as possible. Over the course of the game, more Destruction Hazards gradually open in the walls. </p>\n<p>Destruction mode is a race against time. Players are simply tasked with clearing the stage of blocks as quickly as possible--by dropping them into Hazards. No score is kept, only time is recorded. Here, the Wild block, rather than closing all Hazards, will open all the hazards in one wall--which means that a player may change gravity and drop every single block into the open wall of destruction.</p>\n<p>Zen mode is identical to Challenge mode, except that players select any of the 30 difficulty levels and play on that level as long as they want. The difficulty never advances in this mode, so it's the place where players can just zone out clearing blocks, or hone their skills.</p>\n<p>Puzzle mode uses the same gameplay concepts (except Wild blocks), but uses it to challenge players in a different way. There are 100 puzzles in the game and these feature stacks of blocks that must be cleared in a set number of moves. For instance, the first 40 puzzles can all be solved by making a single move somewhere in the game space. Difficulty gradually advances and the first set of puzzles simply utilize ordinary blocks, then incorporate Gravity blocks, then Bomb blocks, and finally, both Gravity and Bombs are incorporated in the puzzles together. </p>\n<p><em>GravBlocks</em> also features 60 Achievements (unlocking these is key to unlocking additional block and background graphics) and Leaderboards.</p>",

The wold he traverses is dangerous, deserts filled with malevolent crows, haunted mansions, cities where bombs litter the street... but it is worth it for the prestige of cherry picking.</p>\n<p>Mr. Legs will walk determinedly to the right and it up to the player to alter the length of Mr. Legs' legs. The characters height is crucial to be able to snag berries or avoid crows. Another standard hazard are time bombs. These can be detonated at a safe distance before they explode on Mr. Legs by tapping them, sometime bombs can be exploded to get rid of enemies or obstacles. If an explosion, enemy, or obstacle hits Mr. Legs he will disgorge some of his collected fruits, should he not have any fruits the level will end. There are nine areas to traverse, and they are unlocked if players collect enough cherries in the area preceding. Up to three stars per area are awarded to the player based on how many out of all fruit on the stage the player managed to get to the end of the area with, getting all the stars in both difficult settings (easy/hard) is the goal of the game.</p>",

The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible by creating matching lines with four tiles of the same colour, horizontally, vertically or diagonally. At the first level three new tiles appear per turn. With each turn the player has one opportunity to create a match by dragging a tile around anywhere on the board as long as there is an unobstructed path. When a match is created, the tiles disappear. The new tiles that appear with each new turn have a random colour and a random placement on the board. When a successful match is made, the player has another opportunity to move another tile and create a match, before a new turn is started. It is also possible to create matches of up to seven tiles, by connecting two three-tile groups for instance.</p>\n<p>The game consists of four levels. In the first one three tiles appear per turn, in the second four tiles etc. The goal is to survive as long as possible and a certain amount of matches are needed to progress to the next level. Any move can be undone with a button in the top right corner. By creating combos a power-up can be earned to move a tile anywhere on the board, even when the path is not clear.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Joyful Executions</em> is a strategy game that satirizes the propaganda of the North Korean government. Players control Kim Bok Kyong, a young girl who is a North Korean commissar that commands the firing squad punishing traitors. The game consists of different rounds with multiple waves for each one. A wave consists of a number of traitors positioned in front of the firing squad. The main goal is to survive as long as possible and that depends on the approval of the divine leader who rates the performance.</p>\n<p>There are four types of characters that can appear in front of the squad and the expected enemies are shown before starting the round. On the right side of the screen a weapon can be chosen. It also displays the remaining waves and ammo. The player has to assess the type and amount of enemies taking into account the limited supply of ammo to instruct the squad of four soldiers to shoot by clicking a <em>Fire</em> icon. There is also a time limit and when it takes too long the wave passes and the enemies remain for the next wave. The round can also be lost when the court is entirely filled up with enemies. Each round has a number of random events, such as double damage, weapon jamming or a soldier dropping out. After each round the performance is rated.</p>\n<p>When performing badly, an optional mini game can be played after finishing the round. It shows Kim Bok Kyong in the court with a number of shot enemies lying on the ground. She has to wait until a survivor raises his hand begging for mercy and then quickly tap his hand to shoot. When the mini game is lost, the approval rating goes down even more.</p>\n<p>By performing well money is earned that can be spent in an in-game shop. Some of the weapons are a rifle, a machine gun, grenades etc., but each with limited ammo. Ammo needs to be bought and weapons can be upgraded, for instance providing more damage or a larger ammo capacity. The type of weapon has to be assessed and some are more effective against specific types of enemies than others. The game is entirely free to play without in-app purchases.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Rising Empires</em> is a strategic, single-player 4X civilization game. The focus is on the strategic level: positioning of units, settlements and holding of territory play a major part. Besides that the game has an element of civilization building with a choice of technology advances to develop that gives all different kinds of more or less necessary improvements. You compete against other computer-controlled empires that follow the same rules as you do.</p>\n<p>You start with two settlements and from there you can expand with more settlements in the wilderness if you want. The surroundings are totally empty except for terrain. If you do not see the point in establishing more settlements you can still explore the surroundings by sending scouts there. Eventually you will encounter scouts from neighbouring empires, they are controlled by an artificial intelligence and follow the same rules as you do and they have started from the same meagre two settlements background.</p>\n<p>You can see the game as a competition between a couple of empires, your rating among the worlds empires could be read if you want to keep track of how you are doing. The game is rather open, with a couple of different strategies. Each empire have a range of preset choices to make that makes them better in some fields and not so in other. During play, your choice s on how to develop the settlements and what path in the civilization advances to explore makes every empire quite different from each other.</p>\n<p>Warring is a large part of the game and it is conducted in battles when the troops of different empires meet on the map. The troops specifics are chosen by yourself and the choices of proficiency are given by your civilization advances and must also be supported by development of the settlements. Unless you progress in a very odd branch of the civilization tree you will have similar traits of your troops as the other empires.</p>\n<p>A distinct aspect of the game is that the map is on two levels. The empires does not only cover the bright sunlit lands we are used too but there are also a dark netherworld. The Netherworld shares many terrain traits of the brightlands but the mountains are replaced with impassable stone with some tiny corridors that make up excellent defending posts.</p>\n<p>Mostly tapping is used as an input method, long press is used for info, panning is used to navigate the map, but there is no pinching or other two finger gestures. There are different settings to influence the speed, based on the power of the device it is played on. It is released as a paid premium version and as a free version with advertisements on the screen.</p>",

The gameplay is in the spirit of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Lemmings\">Lemmings</a>, with the chicks traipsing across the landscape until they hit an obstacle, and then turning tail and going back the way they came. However, unlike Lemmings, which relies on the player assigning tasks to each of the critters, <em>Chicks</em> requires players to manipulate the environment itself by placing springs or barriers in the proper locations. Doing so allows the chicks to traverse the entire landscape, hopping from platform to platform until they finally reach their destination. But be sure to avoid the chick-hungry snakes that inhabit some of the levels!</p>\n<p>Chicks features 25 levels, each steadily increasing in difficulty. As in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/46396/angry-birds/\">Angry Birds</a>, players are awarded one to three stars if they complete a level. The number of stars indicate how well the player performed.</p>",

In each level, the player must set up defense towers in pre-determined locations in order to defend his base against incoming waves of droids. There is a number of different kinds of towers, each with different strengths and weaknesses. The towers can be attacked and destroyed by the droids. </p>\n<p>Destroying droids yields alloy which can be spent to buy or repair towers, or upgrade them to more powerful versions. The player can deploy several special weapons, e.g. an EMP which paralyzes droids, but each special weapon costs energy which is replenished slowly over time. After finishing a level, the player receives coins and diamonds, which can be spent between levels to buy various upgrades (e.g. more health for buildings, more maximum energy, etc.)</p>\n<p>The player can purchase additional coins and diamonds for real money, or earn them by performing simple tasks (such as downloading and running a specific app, or watching a game trailer).</p>",

The player uses a rotating cannon to launch balls which bounce off the screen edges and other balls, and eventually come to a stop, at which point they grow as far as they can fit. When struck by a moving ball, a sphere already on the field loses a point of health; when it loses all three points, it disappears, and the player scores a point. The game is lost if the launched ball ends up falling beyond the dotted line at the bottom. </p>\n<p>There are three modes of play available. In Arcade mode, the player is simply trying to get as many points as possible. The Level mode consist of several levels, where the player is challenged to get a specific number of points. In Fun mode, the player can set the movement speed of the ball and the cannon, and the balls simply bounce off the bottom line, making failure impossible.</p>",

The game includes several types of BMX bikes with different characteristics. They are unlocked in a shop spending a virtual currency earned by catching gold coins and doing stunts. The gameplay is based on a two-finger mechanism: touching the right side of the screen is used to jump and the left side is used to switch between the three paths on the track. Stunts are performed by shaking the device and the bike goes forward automatically.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Cestos</em> is an online multiplayer game based around one-on-one matches. Both players start with an equal number of marbles (two or three, depending on the map) on the playfield, and must eliminate all of the opponent's marbles. Each turn, both players choose the angle and strength with which to push each of their balls, then both confirm their choices and watch the outcome. There are six maps available, and the exact rules vary slightly between them; on most levels, the players eliminate the opponent's marbles by shoving them into pits, and marbles leave behind landmines every time they are moved. A mine explodes when rolled into and pushes marbles away. </p>\n<p>The maps included are: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Black Hole</strong> - a simple map with a single large pit in the middle.</li>\n<li><strong>Stoplight</strong> - the map features five pits, which keep opening and closing throughout the match.</li>\n<li><strong>Minefield</strong> - the map contains no pits; instead, marbles are destroyed when they hit a mine five times.</li>\n<li><strong>Speedball</strong> - a map where the marbles move at double speed.</li>\n<li><strong>Sumo</strong> - a map where the marbles don't leave behind landmines, and the focus is on shoving the balls against each other.</li>\n<li><strong>Islands</strong> - a map made up of two unconnected platforms, one for each player, where the goal is just to keep your balls from falling off your platform before the opponents' do.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The game offers a system of achievements (called \"feats\") which reward the player with ways to customize the appearance of his avatar, as well as a friend system and an in-game chat.</p>",

There are three control options, either dual on-screen analog sticks, gyroscope or an Xperia Play compatible internal or external gamepad.</p>",

Fortunately she has a magical protective barrier that no monster, no matter how great of size can breach. And killing monsters is a sure way to make money! Her avarice knows know limit, and the monster supply is endless, by combining these facts with shrewd investment a wizard can make a pretty penny in no time.</p>\n<p>Gameplay consists of the magical heroine walking to the right as the background scrolls by, repeating every few seconds or so. Monsters continually wander up to attack, and are repelled by a magical forcefield around the character. There is no way to die, or lose. As monster approach or stumble away from the forcefield they can be destroyed with a magical wand shot. No aiming is required, just tapping the screen automatically damages monsters. Magic skills load over time, which require the player to enter a series of directional inputs that result in a more devastating and longer lasting attack. Each monster earned gives a set amount of coins. After intervals larger boss monsters will appear that can be converted into larger sums of coins.</p>\n<p>The money collected can be used to upgrade either weapons, magic, investments, or treasures. The weapons result in more money being made from killing monsters, as well as increasing the speed at which they can be destroyed. The magics require increasingly long combinations of directional inputs to execute but offer new visuals and longer lasting kill times. Investments, in various institutions such as schools, will pay dividends continuously ever few seconds to the players overall amount of money. Treasures increase the amount of money or effectiveness of the other categories.</p>\n<p>Every few hours the player can open a treasure chest to receive a random amount of money. There is no final goal to the game other than to increase the money or points of the heroine and all gameplay continues indefinitely.</p>",

The goal is to clear out the board, removing pegs by jumping other pegs over them. There are two modes available, Saga or Classic. </p>\n<p>In Saga mode, the player completes the levels in sequence. To complete a level and unlock the next board, there must be no more than three pegs remaining once there are no available moves left. On some levels, the player must leave the pegs in specific squares on the board. </p>\n<p>The Classic mode offers a number of board shapes, and the goal is to gain a high score by removing as many pegs as possible in the fewest moves.</p>",

Several board variants are available, with both square and triangular shapes. On some boards, the player must leave the last peg in a specific spot on the board to win. </p>\n<p>The game includes an automatic solution feature, which attempts to find a solution for the current board setup. It's also possible to create and play custom boards. The game keeps track of high scores (solutions with the fastest completion time and the least moves.) </p>\n<p>In-game ads are present, both in the form of banners, and ads which sometimes pop up and cover the entire screen.</p>",

It's also possible to find a star which makes Crystal Boy grow to three times his size to destroy traps in his way, but collision with a raven makes a giant Boy become small again. It is possible to choose music from the player's library to play in-game. </p>\n<p>The game was originally released as part of the compilation <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/66818/picopicogames/\">PicoPicoGames</a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Smash</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Breakout\">Breakout</a> clone, where the player must bounce a ball to destroy bricks and keep it from falling off the bottom of the screen. The paddle is controlled with the touchscreen; the player can drag his finger to move the paddle, or tap the screen to quickly move the paddle there. There are two game modes, Challenge and Arcade. Challenge mode contains 120 levels divided into 6 \"galaxies\", and clearing out all bricks on a level unlocks the next one. The Arcade mode consists of a single level, with new bricks constantly appearing at the top of the screen, and the only goal to accumulate as much score as possible before a game over. </p>\n<p>As usual in <em>Breakout</em> games, the playfield contains bricks of various types, which need a varying number of hits to be destroyed. There are also bonuses dropping down from destroyed bricks, such as multiple balls, temporary lengthening of the paddle, or creating a barrier at the bottom of the screen. Other things dropping down include harmful pickups which shorten the paddle or make it move backwards, and \"M\" points. The latter can be spent to buy upgrades that increase the number of lives available on a level, or improve the function of the bonus pickups.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Missile Panic</em> is an action game where the player controls a missile and on each level must destroy several \"cores\" by flying into them. The missile constantly flies forward and can be turned in four directions, using on-screen controls, but cannot instantly turn 180 degrees. Colliding with a wall destroys the missile and means a game over; there is also a time limit to every level. The speed of the missile increases whenever it picks up an energy power-up or destroys a core.</p>\n<p>Destroying a core causes the missile to lose one unit of energy, and if energy runs out while some cores remain intact, the level ends in failure. Energy can be replenished by collecting colorful balloons, and if energy is already full, the energy bar increases. Another bonus is the recovery flag, which restores the missile speed and energy to full and resets the time limit. </p>\n<p>The game was originally released as part of the compilation <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/66818/picopicogames/\">PicoPicoGames</a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Pico Pico Puzzle</em> is a puzzle game where, on each level, the player needs to help several soldiers escape a dungeon. Soldiers can be moved in four directions, one tile at a time, and all of them move simultaneously in the same direction. A soldier doesn't move if he's against a wall or another obstacle. To finish a level, all tiles with keys on them must be occupied by soldiers, with no other soldiers left. </p>\n<p>There are many obstacles and dangers on the later levels. Water and pitfalls kill soldiers who run into them, monsters block soldiers unless you pick up a sword, bottles and blue balls need to be pushed around, cracked floor gives way if passed over too many times, arrows allow soldiers to only walk in one direction over them. </p>\n<p>There are 64 levels, with later levels unlocked by completing earlier ones. However, the game does not save the player's progress, meaning that the player must unlock all levels from the beginning with each play session. </p>\n<p>The game was originally released as part of the compilation <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/66818/picopicogames/\">PicoPicoGames</a>.</p>",

To complete each level, the diver must destroy all the immobile monsters and reach the exit, while avoiding the enemies' attacks.

        "description": "<p><em>Real Einstein's Riddle</em> is a puzzle game, based on a logic puzzle called \"Zebra Puzzle\" or \"Einstein's Puzzle\". The puzzle involves multiple persons -- each of which has a different occupation, likes a different drink, owns a different pet, etc. -- and the player must figure out all the characteristics of all the individuals. To help in this, the player is given a set of clues such as \"The painter drinks Coffee\" or \"The Englishman isn't named Louis\". There are four difficulty levels, each with a different number of people and their traits. Each difficulty level contains 80 puzzles. </p>\n<p>During the gameplay, a table is shown with each column corresponding to a particular person's traits, and each cell containing several icons that represent possible choices. The player can turn the icons on and off to narrow down a person's given trait, eventually choosing one right option once he is sure of his choice. Hints can be read one-by-one, but the player can also \"shelve\" a hint he no longer needs to keep it from showing up, and can use a \"filter\" option to only view the hints that mention specific characteristics. </p>\n<p>The game contains ad banners that can be turned off for a fee.</p>",

This is done by reading the number clues on the top and side of the picture which will tell the player how many cells will be filled and left out and which color should be used. The game is fairly straightforward with just one screen of puzzles to solve and the ability to quick save in the middle of a puzzle in case the player has to stop playing before he/she is done. Once a puzzle is solved, the picture will be revealed on the puzzle selection screen. All of the puzzles are of the same size (15x15 cells), so the game's difficulty never increases unlike many games of the genre.</p>\n<p>The Android version of the game features 100 puzzles to solve, while the iOS version adds an additional 100 puzzles from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=LogicKingdom2\">LogicKingdom2</a>.</p>",

The Humans are losing a war against the Antarans and the research base is developing a weapon to turn the tables. The player has control of a prototype of this weapon, a device that can manipulate gravity at great distances, and must use it to protect the station from Antaran forces while assisting Human supply ships attempting to deliver materials to the station. This is accomplished by monitoring the station's radar for incoming ships and using it to view the ships from a top down perspective as they traverse the asteroid field toward the station.</p>\n<p>During a mission the player can touch the screen to create a gravity well at that location, pulling nearby asteroids toward its center. Using this technique, the player engages in two types of gameplay: deflecting asteroids from the path of incoming supply ships, or hurling asteroids at Antaran raiders. Destroying the Antaran ships can be a challenge, as they use AI to dodge out of the way and return fire with a variety of weapons systems.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Hexxagon</em> is a board game, based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/69188/ataxx/\">Ataxx</a> concept and similar to its DOS adaptation <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1039/hexxagon/\">Hexxagon</a>. This two-player game takes place on a board made up of hexagons. Each turn, a player can move one of his pawns two spaces away, or clone one of his pawns onto an adjacent free space. If a pawn is put down on a space adjacent to the opponent's pawns, they are turned into the player's own pawns. The goal is to have the majority of pawns once the board is filled up. Apart from a classic human-vs-human mode, the game offers three modes of human-vs-computer play, with nine difficulty levels available. </p>\n<p>In the \"puzzle\" mode, the player makes his way through a series of levels in sequence, each with a different board shape and background picture. The levels are divided into chapters, each of which has the player controlling pawns of a different color. Winning a level gives the player some stars, depending on the difficulty. </p>\n<p>In \"rating\" mode the player competes with the computer on a chosen board (unlocked by completing levels in puzzle mode). The game then calculates the player's Elo rating, depending on his performance. </p>\n<p>In \"zen\" mode the player can play a game on any board unlocked in puzzle mode, and is able to choose the side he'll be controlling. Winning a game gives the player points depending on difficulty. </p>\n<p>The game contains an achievement system. Getting an achievement grants the player a couple of Discs which come in handy in \"rating\" mode, as they allow the player to undo a number of moves without a scoring penalty.</p>",

Just like its predecessor it takes its inspiration from the DOS <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1039/hexxagon/\">Hexxagon</a>, with the players moving and cloning their pawns around the hexagonal boards in order to transform the opponent's pawns into their own. </p>\n<p>A number of game modes are available. In Ranking and Star Collecting mode, the player competes against the computer, unlocking new boards as he goes. Successfully completing a board in either of these modes also unlocks it for play in Rating mode and in human-vs-human games. </p>\n<p>In Ranking mode, there are nine difficulties to choose from. Completing a board increases the player's rating, based on the difficulty level chosen. In Star Collecting mode, each board has three \"star\" hexes on it; the player is challenged to occupy as many stars as possible upon completing a board. Apart from adding to the player's score in this mode, collecting a minimum number of stars is necessary to access later boards. In Rating mode, the player tries to gain a high Elo rating by successfully defeating the computer opponent; the rating increases depending on the difficulty level chosen, with thirteen difficulties to choose from. There are also three modes for competing against other human players: offline play, online play against a randomly chosen opponent, or online play against an opponent from the player's Google+ Circles. </p>\n<p>The player can compare his scores in four game modes (Ranking mode, Star Collecting mode, Rating mode and online play) with other players from all over the world. The game also contains an achievement system and in-app purchases, where money can be spent to buy gems that can disable ads or unlock all boards.</p>",

You can spend abducted cows to get better ships or pilots and buy multiple boosts increasing your chance to have better score.</p>\n<p>You control your ship using one-finger swiping; the ship follows your moves without any delay. Hovering over a cow for a while, abducts it. Getting near humans or their defences lets your ship attack them with laser beams. If you make it to the mother ship, you will receive boost that makes you indestructible and boost you for a short \nwhile.</p>\n<p>The game allows you to abduct cows in three different areas: farmland, mines and city. They look different and the enemies and obstacles change depending on the area.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Viperbyte</em> is a variant on the classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Snake\">Snake</a> game of the 1970's. The game requires two players (human vs human or human vs AI) and the goal is to be the first to achieve 100 points. </p>\n<p>Points are scored by eating matching color hearts that randomly appear on the play field, or by eating your opponent\u2019s body segments. As you score points, your body grows in length, which in turn can be attacked by your opponent to regain points. If your snake becomes trapped, your body segments are consumed and points are awarded to the opponent. </p>\n<p>To successfully eat a heart, your snake color must match the heart color. If the color does not match, the heart is still consumed but the points are awarded to your opponent. You can change the color of your snake at any time. Eating hearts also awards venom, which is required to use certain abilities. The pace of the game is increased as a player approaches the winning score. To win, a player must have quick reflexes and a successful strategy in acquiring and using venom.</p>\n<p>Venom can be used for the following abilities:* Attack Ability: charge at your opponent to cut them in half. Score points from the severed body segments.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Shield Ability: protects you against one attack from your opponent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Butterfly Bomb: makes your opponents body segments fly off in all directions after a 10 second countdown. The bomb is visible to you but appears as a normal heart to your opponent. Caution: the bomb can be passed back to you if your opponent makes a successful attack in the countdown period.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Escape Ability: allows you to slide out of a tricky situation. Prevents loss of body segments when trapped.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sacrifice Ability: sacrifice body segments (and score) to gain venom. This lets you use your other abilities when you need them.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p><em>Running Circles</em> is a reflex action game based on moving between circles. The player controls a character that runs endlessly, without the player's input, inside a circle. By tapping the screen it moves the outer rim and tapping again back inside. The goal of the game is to move between as many connecting circles as possible, collecting diamonds and avoiding enemies along the way.</p>\n<p>Circles only have a small part where they connect so the player has to time carefully. If the connection is missed, the character crashes and the game is over. The same happens when colliding with a circle while on the outer rim or with an opponent (both stationary and moving). Levels in the single-player mode are randomly generated for each session with only one try. There are many difficult parts where tapping quickly is required to avoid collisions as the character keeps on running and can never be stopped. The game keeps track of the best score, also visually while playing.</p>\n<p>The game has a multiplayer mode where another player can be challenged to get the best score in a level. This is either done in real-time or as a challenge against a ghost version played at a later time. Diamonds collected during games can be used to continue from the point the character died or to unlock additional characters. The game is free-to-play with advertisements and in-app purchases. In-app purchases are used to acquire additional diamonds, unlock all characters, remove advertisements and enable an easy mode for single-player games. There is a tutorial to practise as well as daily bonuses.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Doodle Basketball 2</em> is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/73875/doodle-basketball/\">Doodle Basketball</a>. Just like the first title it is a game about launching a basketball into the basket. The basketball is placed on a court in different spots in succession. The player taps and holds while moving to change the ball's trajectory, marked by a red dotted line. By releasing it the ball is launched. At the start the player has nine lives and the goal is to score as much as possible until no more lives are left. More points are provided from shooting from a distance. More points are provided from shooting from a distance. If a swish basket is scored, without touching the board or the ring, an additional ball (life) is provided. If three swishes in succession are scored, a bigger basket is provided for the next three shots.</p>\n<p>The game expands the score system from the first game with new types of throws. If a ball is bounced on the ground and then goes in the basket, ten additional points are provided. If the ball hits the side of the screen and then goes in, the points are tripled. If both the court and the wall are used, the points are quadrupled. Other novelties for this version are different themes for the courts and a collection of different types of basketballs that can be unlocked in exchange for points.</p>\n<p>Multiplayer is entirely new for this version, either by passing on the device, using Bluetooth or online multiplayer. It is based on the Minus Five pickup game where players shoot the ball in turns. If the ball misses the basket the player gets a minus and the first letter of a five-letter word is opened up. If the first player scores, the second player needs to mimic the shot in a general way (using the floor, using the wall or both). There are four ball priorities (simple shot, floor ball, wall ball, and floor and wall ball). The player who fails to score the fixed number of balls (five) loses the game and drops out.</p>\n<p>The game's visuals are hand drawn with crayon. The game is once again free and does not contain in-app purchases, but now there are advertisements.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Developer Google has a tradition of including easter eggs with the release of each Android operating system. For Lollipop (Android 5) they included a variant of the mobile game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Flappy+Bird\">Flappy Bird</a>. Instead of tapping repeatedly to keep a bird in the air as it passes through narrow openings between pipes, players now control the Android mascot as it is maneuvered between large lollipops. The game keeps tracks of the score for each passed lollipop and there is only one life. When colliding, the level has to be restarted. The level design, direction and colours, as well as the time of day, is randomized for each session.</p>\n<p>The game is accessed by going to the about section in the settings of the phone or tablet, and tapping the Android version repeatedly.</p>",

Each room usually takes about ten to twenty actions to complete. The environment is shown from a first-person perspective. Certain parts of the environment can be tapped to take a closer look. Items can be picked up and are stored in an inventory, to use them elsewhere or to combine them to create something new. Items can be tapped twice to get a closer look. There are also many puzzles based on combinations of letters and numbers where the code needs to be found somewhere else in the environment. There is a free version of the game with an in-app purchase to remove all advertisements as well as a commercial versions. Both versions offer the same content.</p>",

The game consists of eighteen missions where one of three lions (Cecil, Jericho or King) needs to survive for a certain amount of time, kill hunters or protect cubs.</p>\n<p>The levels are set in small city environments that can be explored freely. The lion is moved using a virtual D-Pad in the bottom left corner and a virtual button in the bottom right corner can be tapped to attack. A mini-map in the top right corner shows the position of the hunters and cubs, as well as the direction the lion is facing. The lion has a limited amount of energy (health) and that is shown in the top left corner. By completing missions coins can be earned to unlock the lions Jericho and King. They are identical in abilities, but have a different speed. Coins are also provided for running into objects or knocking them over. Additionally coins are needed to unlock a new level if the previous one was not completed. The game is in many ways unpolished, apparent through clipping problems and certain animations that are lacking.</p>\n<p>The game is free-to-play without in-app purchases, but advertisements are shown regularly.</p>",

In order to cope with her loss, the player has to drag her through the five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. These are all represented by five side-scrolling levels full of puzzles. Each level contains various 'angels' or statues that remind Anemone of certain things about her mother's personality. Though reading the 'angels' is completely optional, completing them can reveal Anemone's real ending. The game is short, around 30 minutes to an hour long, depending on a player's puzzle-solving speed.</p>",

It uses 80's bright neon visuals with ghosting and music from that decade. The screen has the shape of a curved arcade display. The game was launched with 60 short, maze-like levels. The player controls a beam of light through four on-screen arrows. It moves at a constant speed and leaves behind a permanent trail that cannot be touched. It is also not allowed to hit walls or other objects. The trail of light needs to be guided to a white surface to complete the level.</p>\n<p>Some mazes only have a single path and only require quick reflexes, while others require some planning. This cannot take too long as the trail will soon narrow the options. The game is free-to-play with in-app purchases to buy power-ups (slow motion, allow more hits or view a map with the solution), block advertisements, skip a level or skip an entire page of levels, or unlock everything at once.</p>",

The game takes place on a board made up of square cells of various colors, and the player's goal is to expand his territory to fill the board with one color, starting with a single cell in the top-left corner. In each move, the player chooses a color, and all cells of the specified color that border the player's territory are annexed. </p>\n<p>The game offers four play modes: Casual (with no move limit), Step Challenge (the player must fill the board within a specified minimum number of moves), and two Flood Race modes where the player competes with the computer, or another human player, to get a larger region of the board under his control. Three board sizes (12x12, 18x18, 24x24) and six different color palettes are available.</p>",

The player obtains \"Happy cats\" after filling the \"meow bar\", which increases the player's power, providing skills or getting new kittens. Kittens produce \"Happy cats\" automatically and learn new motions and talents when they level up.</p>\n<p>Challenges come with a time limit after completing several stages. Kittens which help the player may fall asleep if too many cats escape from the box. Further stages allow the player to obtain \"happy cats\" more efficiently by good decisions of triggering active skills and kitten talents.</p>\n<p>\"Clean\" is a special function to receive coins by restarting from the first stage when the player does not have enough power to proceed. Coins are used to acquire or upgrade toys, which help the player to achieve new stage records by different combinations of extra abilities.</p>\n<p>There are two versions of the game: a free one with advertisements and a commercial version without ads.</p>",

When the ball hits one of the paddle's three sections, it becomes warmer and when it is hot, bullets are shot automatically, destroying the bricks above. Particles have physics and will collide with the paddle or the walls. The player is rewarded for clearing columns and that increases the speed of the ball.</p>\n<p>The game can be played in an endless mode or in a set of procedurally generated levels where the difficulty level is gradually increased. Destroyed bricks often leave behind power-ups such as additional balls or explosions. Diamonds can be collected as a currency to upgrade the paddle multiple times, improving the fire power. The game is free-to-play with an in-app purchase to remove the advertisements.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Trailbreaker: Jupiter Edition</em> is an action game inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Trailblazer\">Trailblazer</a> where you guide a ball through lanes in space in a race against time. The ball accelerates by itself and can be moved left and right, and jump to follow a path and avoid falling into a void. Optionally brakes can be used to slow down the ball. Next to missing parts and platform jumping, tracks also have obstacles. The amount of recoveries per level is limited and time is also lost until the ball is back.</p>\n<p>The game is free and does not contain in-app purchases. It is supported through ads, but not during gameplay. It contains about 250 levels grouped in eight level packs with different types. Some level packs include obstacles falling from the skies. Levels are procedurally generated and they last between 20 and 90 seconds to complete. The controls can be customized, using on-screen buttons or tilting the device.</p>",

As with many merchant games, it begins with the playing character owing a loan they cannot pay with the available money. The only way to pay the debt is by buying goods, moving to another location and selling goods at a profit. The loan grows every day, and if at the end of the game the player is unable to pay, they will have to face the loan shark, a huge dragon.</p>\n<p>The game is played in turns, and moving from a town to another one takes one turn (\"day\"). The game length can be 20, 30 or 50 days. A menagerie of monsters will attempt to stop the player, but they can run from them, bribe them or even turn them into valuable resources if they invest in a \"bounty hunter license\". Random events (such as helpful wizards teleporting the player, goods sold at a higher or lower price) can also help or hinder the player. </p>\n<p>As with <em>Dope Wars</em>, the game is luck dependent: the price of goods vary randomly from town to town and random events and encounters can heavily influence the early game. However, the player can also buy items in shops to minimize risk, such as weapons and armor to increase their chances in a fight or trading rumors to remove the randomness of goods' prices.</p>\n<p>A Challenge mode provides variety, changing some of the game rules and usually hindering the player, for example by reducing the game's length without changing the amount of the loan or by having the monsters deal double damage.</p>",

It is based on different games in the <em>Hellgate</em> franchise, starting with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Hellgate:+London\">Hellgate: London</a> in 2007. It takes place in a futuristic, post-apocalyptic London where Earth is invaded through Hellgate portals. Fighting in different locations in London the player's character is a soldier who resists the invasion. There are different areas split up in multiple levels, often with short story sequences.</p>\n<p>Each level consists of about five static scenes with some automatic movement to move to the next one. While moving no interaction is possible, including firing. From such a static position the player only needs to aim and shoot. For each level up to three stars can be earned by completing objectives. Sometimes a specific area needs to be defended or destroyed, enemies need to be killed and there are boss fights. Rewards include experience to level up, the basic currency money and dog tags. There is also an energy/stamina system that needs waiting time or a refill through currencies to keep playing levels. The premium currency of gems is used to buy single-use buff items before starting a mission.</p>\n<p>Up to two guns can be carried and swapped on the fly. These include pistols, machineguns, sniper rifles and so on. They have to be reloaded when the clip is empty. Head shots are rewarded and there are often power-ups in the environment, such as exploding barrels, bombs or items that freeze enemies temporarily. Gradually and by spending money the player can buy armor and learn active and passive skills. These can also be upgraded several times. Active skills are additional abilities with a cooldown period. They include a shock wave, a devil's spear, a cold wave or summoning creatures. Passive skills mostly affect statistics such as stamina, health, precision, accuracy, regeneration or a time rift. Several types of weapons are found by completing missions and these can be upgraded several times. Next to the main missions there are challenge missions known as Challenge Hellrift.</p>",

To charge their swing, the player taps and holds the touch screen, and then releases it to swing at the pitch. The batted ball can also pop balloons floating over the playing field for bonus points.

        "description": "<p>This simple numbers game requires the player to scratch out all the numbers on the screen. The only way to scratch out numbers is with a pair of digits, or if the sum of the two digits is 10. Though, those digits need to be next to each other either vertically or horizontally. Once a number is scratched out, those spots are considered empty, and the player can then skip over those spots to scratch out more numbers. Once there are no more available moves due to no pairs being able to be scratched out, the player can \"Check\". Once the player Checks, the game adds all the numbers currently not scratched out to the end of the grid. There are two ways to complete a mode, the player can either scratch out every number, or have a game that result in no possible moves.</p>\n<p>There are a few game modes, each mode has a help function that gives a hint on the player's next possible move:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>1-18</em>:<br>\nThe basic game, the numbers from 1 through 18 are used and arranged into a grid. Only the numbers 1 through 9 are used, so the number ten is present as only a 1. Once a row is completely scratched out, the player has the option to clear that row and tidy up the playing grid. The starting playing grid is as follows:  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9<br>\n1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1<br>\n5 1 6 1 7 1 8</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>1-19</em>:<br>\nRuns the same as the 1-18 mode, except that 19 is added. The starting playing grid is as follows:  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9<br>\n1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1<br>\n5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Quick mode</em>:<br>\nThis mode has the option of a starting grid of either 1-18 or random numbers. The random numbers grid will be the same size as a 1-18 grid. This mode is designed to create a quicker game by allowing two things: 1) the help option refresh timer is sped up considerably, 2) it automatically advises once there isn't any further moves and to Check.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Column mode</em>:<br>\nThis mode doesn't allow the clearing of rows, but of columns. This makes for a trickier game than previous modes, as you can easily run into a game that has no moves. There is an option of a 1-18 grid, or random number grid.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Time duel</em>:<br>\nThis mode is a test on how quick the player is to solve a grid. The starting grid for this mode is random digits.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

Players can play matches with teams to practice or participate in leagues and cups. The game can also be approached as a business simulation, managing teams and players while match results are calculated automatically.</p>\n<p>Teams can have different formations and the strength is determined through three numbers representing offensive, midfield and defensive strength, based on the score of the individual players also shown through a number. A custom team can be created, with a logo, a team name and different options for home and away kits. The game is free-to-play and uses different currencies to recruit new players through card packs at the lottery, similar to many contemporary <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=EA+Sports\">EA Sports</a> games and the Ultimate Team modes in those titles. Pack types include realistic (level 1-5), advanced (4-7), talent (5-7) and midfielder (4-7). Each player is defined through six statistics. Management options include team formation and tactics, training to improve player attributes, facilities to restore or improve the players' conditions such as stadiums, hospitals, physiotherapy centres and youth camps, and transfers through auctions.</p>\n<p>By winning matches the basic coins currency is won, along with experience for the global player level and items such as training points or medical kits. Gold is the premium currency. Training points can be spent to improve specific player abilities, such as shooting, headers, long shots or set pieces. Next to a league system there are friendly games, online tournaments (world arena and social tournament) and continent cups. Matches consume energy points and these take a while to recharge or can be replenished by spending the premium currency.</p>\n<p>The game is controlled through a virtual D-pad for movement on the left side of the screen and virtual buttons on the right side for actions. While attacking there are actions for shooting, passing, sprinting and through shots, and while defending there is pressing, sprinting, tackling and switching players. Many different actions are available as buttons can be manipulated in different ways, such as tapping, holding or sliding up. Additional actions then include short passes, one-twos, through passes, sliding tackles, long passes, feinting, roulette, lob passes and shots, or causing the goalkeeper to rush out.</p>\n<p>The game has social elements to exchange codes and add friends. Coins and items can be swapped as gifts. There is a replay function to review goals. The game does not have licensed player names or teams.</p>",

At the start of the game each player, either an online player or controlled by the computer, is dealt five cards that are hidden for the opponent. Each player chooses one card out of the five to keep and the open spot is fulled up with a new card. The cards are then locked until both players have completed this. Then the hands of five cards are swapped between the players and the process is repeated until five cards have been chosen. While the selected cards always remain hidden, it is still possible to guess what the other player is holding or choosing through the swaps. After choosing five cards two pistol duelers are shown in the middle of a town and as they draw the cards are revealed and the best poker hand wins, shooting the other character.</p>\n<p>The game is free-to-play and does not contain in-app purchases. By winning duels gold is earned and this can be used to bet before starting a new game. Gradually higher betting levels are unlocked. Additional gold can be earned by watching video advertisements.</p>",

For Marshmallow (Android 6.x) they included a variant of the mobile game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Flappy+Bird\">Flappy Bird</a>.</p>\n<p>Instead of tapping repeatedly to keep a bird in the air as it passes through narrow openings between pipes, players now control the Android mascot as it is maneuvered between large marshmallows on sticks. The game keeps tracks of the score for each passed marshmallow and there is only one life. When colliding, the level has to be restarted. The level design, direction and colours, as well as the time of day, is randomized for each session.</p>\n<p>The game is accessed by going to the about section in the settings of the phone or tablet, and tapping the Android version repeatedly.</p>\n<p>The game is still included in Android, hidden away in the activities. You need an \"activity launcher\" to access the game In later versions.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Gem Miner</em> tasks the player with digging a mine to search for a variety of ores and artifacts, which can then be sold to buy new tools, upgrades to existing tools, and improved mining abilities. The game uses a side view platforming-style camera to display large, randomly generated levels that include hazards such as falling rocks, underground lakes, and lava. Character movement is governed by a virtual joystick, while a single virtual button controls the miner's pickaxe. A map in viewable at any time, and is gradually revealed as the player progresses through the mine. Character movement is limited by a stamina meter; once depleted, the miner is unable to move, leaving him to be automatically rescued and forfeiting any ore he's collected. Stamina is replenished by returning to the miner's camp on the surface. Also limiting individual trips below the surface is the miner's inventory size, as any ore collected once the miner's pack is full is lost.</p>\n<p>Additionally, challenges are available that present the player with a specific scenario to overcome. Completing these challenges rewards the player with medals.</p>",

Players have to tap on the screen to hit the zombies before they come back to their graves. The graves are distributed in a 3 x 3 grid. Granny Amelia will pop out of the graves also, so players have to avoid tapping on her. Letting the zombies return to their graves oh hitting granny Amelia reduces the players' sanity level, measured by 5 brains.</p>\n<p>There are 4 types of zombies. Regular ones will just appear and return to their graves. Mutants will come out as humans and must be hit only if and after they transform into zombies; some won't transform and should return to the graves with no penalty. Punk zombies carry spray cans and will use it on the players' screen, blocking the view temporarily. Throwers will throw skulls against the screen.</p>\n<p>Sometimes money will appear on the graves, hitting it awards points. Brains will also appear and can be collected to recover sanity. The game progresses goes on until the sanity meter is completely depleted.</p>",

The game sticks to the side view platforming-style camera of its predecessor, allowing the player to navigate a large, randomly generated mine in search of valuable ore, gemstones, and artifacts. New scenarios called expeditions provide a more guided play style, giving the player specific goals to meet to clear each level. 2 optional mission packs are available as in-app purchases.</p>\n<p>The app supports Bluetooth gamepads, Google TV, and LIFX wireless light bulbs for real-life atmospheric lighting.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Extreme Burger Defense</em> is a tower defense game where the player must protect a burger from waves of hungry bears. The player can set up three types of towers: a tower which shoots bullets at nearby bears, a crystal launcher which launches crystals that explode in a wide radius, and a tower which activates a damaging field every so often that also slows down any bear caught in it. The towers can be only built on grass, on tiles unoccupied by trees. </p>\n<p>Destroying the dastardly ursines causes them to drop silver and (occasionally) gold coins, which must be quickly collected before they fade. Silver coins can be spent on new towers, on chopping down trees, or upgrading the capabilities of constructed towers. The player's cache of gold coins is retained between games and can be spent in the main menu to improve specific types of towers. </p>\n<p>If a bear makes his way to the burger, it will pick up the snack and try to escape with it, and must be killed before it can carry the burger off the screen. When the burger gets successfully stolen, the game ends. There is no ending, and the player's goal is simply to attain the longest time possible.</p>",

Unlike its predecessor it is was released as a premium title and not free-to-play. Like in the 2017 edition the main game mode is the Seasons mode which works largely the same albeit without in app purchases. One difference is that the auto-play option has been replaced with a highlights mode where the match is described as a text commentary. Another new feature is the agency system where agents can be hired to sign players.</p>\n<p>A new game mode in this edition is the 5v5 mode which is made up of mini-game challenges played against other players online. In each game the player either attacks or defends. The player that challenges another player attacks and has to score as many goals as possible while the player who is challenged has to defend and concede as few goals as possible. Each game starts with a kick-off scenario and is followed by ten random scenarios. In each scenario the player has twenty seconds to score. By winning matches the player earns points and advances on the online leaderboard. Challenging a higher ranked team leads to larger rewards.</p>\n<p>The other game modes included are friendlies and two different cups: European Tournament (which is based on Euro 2016) and American Cup (which is based on the 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica).</p>",

        "description": "<p>Fire Escape is an interactive, episodic Virtual Reality project that puts players in Crown Heights, Brooklyn - where they watch a group of residents living across the street as they reckon with the changing neighborhood and gentrification of their building. Over the course of the night, things take a darker turn when a murder takes place, and the player's role grows for a voyeur to a participant, texting different characters as they become entangled in events. As the player watches multiple scenes unfold in real-time, you must choose what to watch knowing you are always missing clues, context, and narrative along the way. With a diverse, eclectic cast of stories, Fire Escape draws from anxiety-induced storytelling of Hitchcock to create a vivid, interactive storyworld for the form of VR.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This zany, madcap choice-based storygame is most certainly the best game ever made using its particular scenario, because its combination of story elements must surely be unique: the player steps into the shoes of a producer of an antique-appraisal television show, a beat typically only nominally livelier than watching paint dry, when an unscheduled guest arrives at the antique fair looking to cash in on a truly vintage set of long-preserved human remains. One inadvertently-invoked resurrection spell later, the homicidal mummy is tearing a strip through the flea market, while various unlikely factions -- witches, a Catholic priest, even the FBI -- compete to subdue the threat and claim its power for their own.  Meanwhile, the player needs to make sure the camera keeps rolling and remains pointed in the direction of breaking action...</p>",

You can choose to either play it passively or actively depending on the upgrades you equip during the game.

        "description": "<p><em>Reblob</em> is a puzzle game for Android. Every level is grid based and a single screen, so all grids are visible at once. The player moves the character squishy from its spawn point orthogonally to reach a destination. Obstacles are blocking walls, deadly lava tiles, deadly cyclopes and blocked destination points \u2013 supporting mechanics are switches to remove some walls, portals to teleport to a specific location and a special switch to open the access to the exit if it is blocked.\nWhen squishy dies in the lava he leaves a bridge that can be used once to cross over the lava. So dying becomes a tactical component in solving a level, but only a finite number of blobs is available in each level. If the last blob is consumed the level needs to be restarted.\nAdditionally \u2013 and this is the unique core mechanic of the game \u2013 you can move the spawn point to a free location up to three grids away from your position, even diagonally.\nSo to traverse the possibility space of the levels you need to think back and forth in space and time and sometimes die to the left to respawn to the right of an obstacle to use the bridges to safely reach the exit.\nThe game offers 65 Levels: 15 for the tutorial, 10 advanced puzzles, 10 portals, 10 cyclops, 10 switches and 10 combinations to prove mastery of all mechanics.</p>",

A mission can for example be to pass a number of checkpoints before the time runs out. In addition to the missions there is also \"free mode\" where the player drives until he/she crashes the car. The road that the player drives on is always straight with cars moving in one or both directions. Bonus money can be earned by driving against the traffic or passing close to the other cars. The money the player earns can then be spent on buying new, more powerful, cars or upgrade existing cars.</p>",

By controlling Munch's tongue, it can latch onto flowers and swing across the level. But this only works with flowers that match the colour of Munch. By eating coloured flies, Munch can change its own colour. In addition there are different flowers with different behaviours. The game consists of 84 levels across four different environments.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Rival Wheels</em> is a motorbike drag racing game with gameplay similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/65267/csr-racing/\">CSR Racing</a>. The game is made up of one-on-one races that are viewed from the side. Forward movement of the bike is automatic with player's controls being limited to revving up the engine, shifting and using nitro boosts. To perform well the player has to aim for good or perfect shifts by shifting up only as the needle reaches the green zone of the tachometer. By shifting well the player's nitro bar fills up. Nitro can be used whenever there is some but when the bar is full an extreme nitro can be used.</p>\n<p>The game consists of a career mode that contains four locations (Tokyo, Havana, New York and Back to Tokyo). In each location, the player has to play ladder races to unlock boss races and beat every boss to unlock the next location. After winning a race the player is awarded cash as well as a box with bike parts. Both are needed to upgrade bikes. To get more bike parts, it is also possible to buy boxes with cash or to enter the black market where parts can be bought and sold. By winning boss fights the player is also awarded blueprints which are needed to unlock new bikes. All bikes in the game are licensed from manufacturers such as Kawasaki, Yamaha and Suzuki. In addition to the ladder and boss races, there are also side jobs that can be played for extra rewards and objective-based star tasks which appear after a location have been completed.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ships Unite</em> is an action game where the player commands a ship, sailing across stormy waters. The game is seen in a side view. As the ship departs, initially the sea is calm, but this soon changes as increasingly tall waves tilt the ship. If the ship tilts too much, the player loses one life (represented by a crewmember), so to counter this the player must tap arrows on the screen to tilt the ship back and keep it as straight as possible. Occasionally, the player also encounters sea monsters. When the monster attacks the ship, the player must rapidly tap the screen to defeat it, or else he will lose a life. Some types of ships also have weaponry which can be used to shoot the monsters as they appear. </p>\n<p>During the journey, crates can be found floating on the sea. By picking up the crates and delivering them to ports along the way, the player earns coins which can be spent to purchase new crew types (with various different abilities). Picking up crates also allows the player to obtain new ships (with differing attributes) or new skins for the ship's captain.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Puzzled Knight</em> is a tile matching game where players match tiles to defeat AI opponents. Players match tiles to perform various actions. Sword tiles fill an attack bar which, when full, performs an attack. Attacks can be blocked by matching shield tiles or negated completely by matching dodge tiles. Gold serves as an in-game currency, while books give the player additional experience points which can be used to level up.</p>\n<p>Arcade Mode consists of 36 levels. The opponent difficulty increases with each level. Tournament Mode resets daily and is made up of tjree rounds. The player battles opponents of increasing difficulty to earn a daily prize. Classic Mode does not involve matching tiles to attack opponents. Instead, each level has a required number of matches that need to be made in order to win.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dungeon Hunter: Curse of Heaven</em> is an entry in the Dungeon Hunter series designed to run on low-end Android smartphones. Unlike the last three games in the series, it's a paid premium title and not free-to-play with in-app purchases. The game's story takes place during the events of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/93530/dungeon-hunter-4/\">Dungeon Hunter 4</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/93531/dungeon-hunter-v/\">Dungeon Hunter 5</a> with the player taking the role of a sibling of Syrann, one of the antagonists of Dungeon Hunter 5. As the survivor of a massacre perpetrated by the forces of King Leandro, the player takes on a quest for vengeance. </p>\n<p>Like other entries in the Dungeon Hunter series, the game is a hack-n-slash action RPG played from a birds-view perspective. A virtual pad is used to move the player character around the screen while buttons are used to activate attacks, use skills and consume health potions. Two different weapons can be equipped at a time and quickly swapped during combat. There are weapons both for close combat (dual blades, greatswords) and ranged attacks (crossbows, staffs). It is also possible to equip up to three skills which give magical abilities.</p>\n<p>The game contains 24 missions that can be accessed from a world map. Each map can be played in three difficulties although only the easiest is initially available, the others have to be unlocked by completing further missions. In each level, there is a portal that when entered starts a challenge where enemies have to be defeated in certain circumstances. There is plenty of loot to collect. Each item has a level that can be increased by fusing it with other items. Once an item has reached its maximum level it can be evolved to a higher tier. All items and enemies can be one of five elements (water, fire, nature, death, light) with each element having a bonus against another element. For example, a water item does extra damage on a fire enemy.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Feed the Kitty</em> is a simple game where the player must tap on sushi as it reaches the cats at the bottom of the screen. The sushi appears in lanes leading up to the cats, like the notes in a rhythm game. The speed at which the sushi moves gets faster with each successful tap. Missing a piece of sushi will cause the player to lose one of the cats and reset the speed, if they only have two cats and miss a piece then it's game over. Some pieces of sushi have special effects, such as temporarily slowing the sushi down, speeding them up, cause more sushi to appear, clear all sushi from the screen, and attract an additional cat. There are also rotten fish, which the player must avoid tapping on.</p>",

Most of the games are also available in other Gameloft Classics compilations (<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/138346/gameloft-classics-action/\">Action</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/138345/gameloft-classics-arcade/\">Arcade</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/138348/gameloft-classics-love/\">Love</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/138349/gameloft-classics-puzzles/\">Puzzles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/138347/gameloft-classics-shooters/\">Shooters</a>). Unlike those releases, this collection uses a free-to-play model where the player buys coins which each gives five minutes of play-time in any of the games.

        "description": "<p><em>They Live to Destroy!</em> is a free VR game with an exaggerated humorous 1980's horror ambience where players build and manage a science institute on an island. Through the construction of buildings and upgrades, and the management of resources, engineers are acquired as a resource to unlock new buildings and upgrades, and generate resources. Once the basic infrastructure is up and running, up to 40 Kaiju monsters who pass by the island every now and then can be tamed and captured. All collected monsters are stored in a catalog. They have different statistics and levels that can be upgraded.</p>\n<p>With a few monsters a campaign battle can be started as the player plans a path on a map with hexagonal tiles. A city is destroyed by capturing a number of waypoints, but on the way other monsters are encountered. After the planning phase the battles are played out automatically, but the player can enter the city with a first-person view and watch the events acting as a photographer snapping pictures. Next to the main campaign battle there are online battles against other players.</p>",

It is inspired by a real food truck business in Indonesia that sells round tofu, which is called Tahu Bulat. It is a clicker/idle game where the goal is to earn profits to invest to expand the food truck and its business. By serving customers the money can be invested in facility upgrades such as a TV, speakers, a tent or a car. The tofu recipe can be improved so prices for the good can be raised. There are also different options to promote the business and expand with new branches to build a tofu empire. The game has various mini-games and a challenge system with other game modes.</p>",

You have a limited supply of invincibility shields and slow-motion power-ups to help you through the tricky gauntlets.  </p>\n<p>There are fifteen different levels (plus tutorial levels), and three different difficulties for 45 challenges in total.</p>",

It was short-lived, most likely never left the open beta phase and was only available for the Chinese market and some other countries. Tencent was responsible for both mobile versions of the game and the separate versions were most likely create to work around the game's approval process in China.</p>\n<p>While the differences between both mobile versions are not entirely clear, the core concept of the game is identical. It is a battle royale game focusing on gunplay where the last man standing wins. This separately developed version has different content and is known to be lighter than the other version, making it accessible on phones with less powerful hardware.</p>",

A first part of the easter egg requires you to unlock a cat emoji as a toast message. Once unlocked, a mini-game can be played by accessing a new menu called Cat Controls. It lets your feed your cat by filling the empty food bowl, water it by filling a water bubbler, and a toy to attract the cat. Each control is a mini-tutorial on how to control smart home stuff from the new power menu.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The arch-demon Caesar lives a hedonistic but ultimately stagnant life from atop his throne in Hell, quickly becoming bored of bedding the same women and being surrounded by the same dull minions every day. His luck changes when, while searching for new concubines, he stumbles upon a set of ancient relics housing the spirits of arch-demons past, who impart their power unto him to aid him in conquering the world. Empowered by his renewed vitality, Caesar sets out on a quest to conquer the territories - and women - of the other kingdoms of Hell and the realms beyond.</p>\n<p><em>TenkafuMA!</em> is a hentai turn-based role-playing game with gacha elements. As Caesar, players form a team of up to five characters with varying skills to clear stages by fighting enemy teams. In each turn, each unit can be set to either attack (which deals damage to the enemy) or defend (which reduces the damage received by the unit in the enemy's turn). Once certain conditions are met, characters can also use an Ultimate Skill which is significantly more powerful than their standard skills. Characters are attributed one of five elements (Fire, Wind, Water, Light, and Darkness), which determines their effectiveness against characters of other elements. New characters can be acquired via a gacha system where the player can spend virtual or real-world currency to gain a random selection of characters from a pre-determined pool.</p>\n<p>There are several other game modes in addition to the main campaign as well as unique quests from periodic updates and events. One such game mode is the Demon Spire, which contains stages with special challenges. Outside of combat, the player can use items to level up their characters or 'discipline' them with sex toys to unlock sex scenes.</p>",

Eventually you will have collected enough to unlock a new room with a new girl, or eventually a whole new hotel building.  </p>\n<p>If progress is stalled you can close the hotel for the night and begin a new day. This will close all the rooms again and reset their level, but will grant you a special \"hearts\" currency.  </p>\n<p>There are also mini-games: a date game where you have to answer her questions appropriately in order to seduce her; a simple card guessing game; and a slots machine where you can win rewards.</p>",

Deciding to take him with her she names him Corrin. She must now try to protect it as she makes her way through the war torn and monster-filled lands.</p>\n<p>Basic movement consists of walking left to right, double-tapping to run, attacking, or doding (with a short cool-down). Special attacks, potions and summoned creatures can also be equipped, as can a wide range of armor and weapons. Attacks and special attacks can be stringed together into various combos.  </p>\n<p>If hit by a strong attack Corrin might be dropped; he must then be retrieved before being able to attack again.  </p>\n<p>Slain enemies frequently drop gold coins or equipment. Unwanted equipment can be sold, or disassemle for scrap ores, in between stages.  </p>\n<p>Back in camp you can also upgrade gear, change skill loadouts, or mine safely for ores.</p>\n<p>The journey goes through several lands, divided into numerous stages each, accessible from a world map. Each level has the goal to simply defeat all the enemies in it, sometimes headed by a boss monster or two. Occasionally you'll come across a puzzle room where a skill tome can be retrieved by solving some simple cipher puzzle.</p>",

Coins are kept between levels and can be exchanged for power-ups. Spare power-ups can be kept in storage, to be used when needed.</p>\n<p>There are ten worlds to complete, each divided into 16 levels. Some levels change up the pace by taking place under water, making Bob swim through them.</p>",

The game is structured into levels where the player has to overcome challenging combat encounters and keep his templars alive to fight another day, while making sure all the aliens are exterminated. The player's templars are strong and resilient but not very fast, meaning that defensive approaches to tactics are usually preferred over extensive maneuvering. Fights usually happen in tight spaces, making chokepoint control an important aspect of gameplay.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Puzzle Cats</em> is a puzzle game where the object is to arrange blocks shaped like, and which have the appearance of, cats so that the blocks cover the entire area of the playing field. But be warned, because the longer it takes to solve a puzzle, the angrier the cats get! As the player clears puzzles and levels up, the difficulty increases, but new cats can be unlocked for play. The player can also unlock costumes for the cats to wear. If the player doesn't like cats, he/she can also reskin the blocks to a more traditional form; those blocks can also take on new looks as puzzles are completed.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dancing Obu Ch\u014d Aniki</em> is a rhythm game in the long-running <em>Ch\u014d Aniki</em> series. Players can have Adon, Samson, Idaten, Benten or Uminin dance to the music heard in the previous <em>Ch\u014d Aniki</em> games.</p>\n<p>Notes scroll down towards the bottom of the screen in four columns and players must tap and hold the correct notes to play along with the music. The better the timing, the more points are earned, but if a certain number of notes are missed then the song fails. The music is accompanied by the characters dancing along to it. Clearing songs provides new dance moves.</p>\n<p>In addition to the main gameplay, there are gacha mechanics that reward players with clothes for the characters.</p>",

Heavily inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Street+Fighter+II:+The+World+Warrior\">Street Fighter II: The World Warrior</a> (the game originally played in the sketch) the player takes on the role of a Blanka-like character with a Wookie-like design as they dodge blasts thrown at them by a muscled representation of the sketch's co-protagonist.</p>\n<p>Gameplay consists of tapping the screen to jump to avoid energy blasts thrown at the player at random intervals. There's a counter at the top of the screen and with each successful dodge +1 is added to it. The game keeps track of the highest score the player has with the stated goal being to \"beat your personal best\". Each increase in score increases the speed of the energy blast thrown making dodging harder. At random, lines from the licensed character, performed by their original voice actor can be heard as gameplay progresses.</p>\n<p>Upon death the player is presented with a link to a newsletter and given the option to subscribe to it. This is the sole purpose of the game as it was released to promote this newsletter. The link leads to a 404 page as the page has since been moved to a different url.</p>",

The journey consists of merging objects together to make newer ones. Larger variety and better access around the land requires the player to earn experience and gain levels. In the inventory, the player can have the number of workers to do manual labor, energy to carry out object making processes, keys to unlock parts of the land, and coins and gems to make purchases. Some encounters require the player to solve a ring puzzle. Occasionally the player will travel to a different land with its own set of puzzles and variety of objects.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Golf Battle</em> is a real-time mini-golf which pits  the player against several other players where each plays simultaneously. The game features many different unlockable levels which progressively up the level of difficulty. Entering competition requires coins which get awarded by playing. 1st place in a match earns you double, while last place leaves you at a loss. Later levels cost much more to compete. Each match consists of three stages which usually give you around 30 seconds to complete. Players that don't reach the hold before the time runs out end up with a penalty. Finishing first doesn't decide the winner, reaching the hold in least number of strikes, does. When more players share 1st or 2nd place, the game decides the winner by letting them make a single shot on a special level where they try to get as close as possible to the hole. Closest player to the hole wins. Various chests are awarded and unlocked by using earned red crystals. Upgrading clubs requires collecting three of the same type and then spending gold coins to upgrade one of the stats. Different clubs are used on different terrains (i.e. grass, desert, ice, etc.). Many elements in the game can also be bought using game's microtransactions.</p>",
