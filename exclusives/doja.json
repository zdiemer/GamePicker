        "description": "<p><em>Bare Knuckle Mobile</em> is an official Streets of Rage game produced by Sega with music by Yuzo Koshiro. The game is essentially a remake of the first <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6599/streets-of-rage/\">SoR</a>, but with higher resolution graphics, new sounds and musical arrangements. Most character sprites are adapted versions of the ones found in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6633/streets-of-rage-2/\">SoR 2</a> (although Blaze is actually a combination of her <em>SoR 1</em> &amp; <em>2</em> appearances), while others did not appear in <em>SoR 2</em>, but were designed in order to be in harmony with the rest.</p>\n<p>Unlike <em>SoR 1</em>, there are just two playable characters: Axel Stone and Blaze Fielding. On the other hand, Adam Hunter will appear as a guide in the initial tutorial, and will join you later on in the game as a CPU-controlled backup character for a while. Also, the number of levels has been lowered to seven, now the second level will be the beach (the third level in the original game), although surprisingly its final boss will be Zamza. The game sports some new sprites which have re-imagined some classic <em>SoR 1</em> enemies in a <em>SoR 2</em> style, and also features a brand new boss character called Harakiri, who replaces Big Ben. The stages are basically improved versions of those found in <em>SoR 1</em>.</p>",

In the standard mode, the game is timed, with Dr. Eggman in the top-left corner, whereas landscape mode is not timed, and Sonic is in the top-left corner. The player must determine where mines are hidden in a minefield by digging on squares. Some squares have numbers uncovered when they are dug, which tells the player how many squares away the nearest mine is. Players use these hints to determine the exact location of the mine, and then mark that square. If the player digs on a square where a mine is hidden, it explodes and the player loses the game. There are also blank squares that don't help or hurt the player. Once all mines are correctly marked, the game is won.</p>",

Enemies can be attacked using a handgun or a spin jump, and attacks can be chained into combos. A boss needs to be defeated at the end of every level.

        "description": "<p>Odin's prophecy gives humanity only a single year before the Demon King's return. Humanity's response: train up a hero who can defeat him and save the world. In this traditional RPG, players take on the role of the hero in that fateful year. Given a limited amount of time, they must pick their moves carefully. There are 15 different unique allies the player can recruit and a large number of different events they can encounter, and the player's actions determine the outcome of the story. Because of the limited slice of the game players can experience on each playthrough, they're encouraged to replay many times to see different possible outcomes. Players who are persistent enough are rewarded with the chance to see the true ending.</p>\n<p>This game takes place in an alternate timeline to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/165548/maou-ga-ochiru-hi/\">original game</a> with players taking on the role of Sophitia, one of the original game's recruitable characters. She's joined by a new set of 15 allies, replacing the original game's cast. The Demon King is different this time, too, but with a twist: there are actually several different Demon Kings, with the antagonist for a particular playthrough selected at random at the start of every game.</p>",

Unfortunately, just as the two of them arrive at Osaka's Mount Tenpo, they encounter yet another death - the body of a young man whose relationship had just ended, next to a suicide note and sleeping pills. To most observers this is a straightforward case of suicide, but Kagami is unconvinced; with inconsistencies he sees on the scene and seemingly irrational behaviour from the victim, he decides there must be some sort of foul play. For Kido, this means that if she wants to get Kagami's mind back on the manuscript he owes her, she's going to have to solve the case.</p>\n<p>This Japanese-style mystery adventure game is text-heavy and menu-driven, with players interviewing witnesses and making choices via menus.

These games are known for being set in well-researched real-world environments; this time takes her to Hokkaido, the colder northern region of Japan. This entry was the first to require DoCoMo's newer FOMA 900i phones, allowing for much more advanced artwork than previous games.</p>\n<p>This Japanese-style mystery adventure game is text-heavy and menu-driven, with players interviewing witnesses and making choices via menus. An epilogue was available on G-Mode's mobile website for players who had completed the game.</p>",

The then-advanced graphical capabilities of DoCoMo's FOMA 700i phones are used to reproduce the sights of the region in great detail. As in previous games, she's nominally assigned to work as the editor for the author Masamune Kagami, but he's easily distracted and becomes involved in solving a mystery instead of writing the manuscript he owes her. In order to ensure she gets his manuscript in on time, she's forced to solve the mystery herself.</p>\n<p>This Japanese-style mystery adventure game is text-heavy and menu-driven, with players interviewing witnesses and making choices via menus.
