Swing the remote like a racket to play.</li>\n<li><strong>Baseball</strong>: The computer automates the running and fielding. The player either pitches or bats.</li>\n<li><strong>Golf</strong>: Swing the remote like a golf club to play through the included 9 holes.</li>\n<li><strong>Bowling</strong>: Play a regular 10 frame game of bowling by swinging the remote like you're rolling a bowling ball.</li>\n<li><strong>Boxing</strong>: Punch, defend, or lean, with the remote and nunchuk used to control both in-game hands.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rather than realistic characters, each game is played using Miis, the simple characters that can be created from within the Wii's Mii Channel.</p>",

The positioning and movement actions of the Wiimote also let the player aim their weapons almost as they would a real gun.</p>\n<p>Not only must the player fight off many clan leaders, but the option is often given to spare lives of the enemy. This can lead to the player gaining more friends in the future, rather than more opponents if Scott is seen to be dishonorable.</p>\n<p>It is up to Scott to hopefully gain allies and uncover the reasons for his financ\u00e9e's kidnapping.</p>",

Collect bananas to gain extra points and lives then roll yourself to the exit point to finish levels. You will need to be careful to avoid the edges, traps and gaps so your monkey can progress on his or her way.</p>\n<p>For the first time in a monkey ball game you'll fight bosses in each world each with their own weak spot. Also, new is that each of the six monkeys now has different characteristics in the single player mode. Choose your monkey carefully as they all have their own strengths and weaknesses; some might weight more, jump better, or accelerate faster than others.</p>\n<p>Then play in 50 party mini-games either by yourself or with up to four friends in multiplayer. Returning games from previous monkey ball titles include: Monkey Golf, Monkey Bowling, Monkey Race, Monkey Target, and Home Run Derby. Play the mini-games individually or in sequence play to see who can get the most points after playing a number of games.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A launch game for the Nintendo Wii, Excite Truck is the \"sequel\" to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7469/excitebike/\">Excitebike</a> games for the NES and N64. The term sequel is used lightly, because now instead of playing on motorcycles, you are racing monstrous trucks across constantly transforming outdoors terrains. </p>\n<p>Like its predecessors, Excite Truck is a racing game pitting you against multiple opponents or other players. Players have the ability to play in tournaments against NPC's to unlock medals, play head to head, or play a single-player special mode. Single player features a mode that allows players to go up against computer-controlled trucks in a competition with two branching difficulties across 4 medal challenges (bronze, silver, medal, platinum). The multiplayer head-to-head also allows for two players to race their trucks against each other, but without the use of the other NPC trucks. Special modes include a slalom challenge, a leap-through-rings jumping challenge, and a demolition derby. Players race on outdoor tracks in a number of locales from Fiji to Scotland. The map is littered with obstacles such as jumps, water hazards, and cliffs to impede your progress.</p>\n<p>Instead of using a traditional joystick, the game is specifically designed around the Wii remote's motion sensing ability. The controller is held sideways without the nunchuk attached, like a steering wheel. Players tilt the controller left and right to turn their truck. In the air, players can tilt the remote back and forth to lean their truck forward or backwards. The #2 button is used for gas, and the D-pad can be used for a turbo.</p>\n<p>The term \"Excite\" is not just used to make the game look like the sequel to an old NES classic. Excite Truck features a complete loss of realism, emphasis on turbo, and chaotic game play. Players have the ability to push their truck's speed far past physical limitations, and jumps can be used to achieve jump heights akin to the N64 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=San+Francisco+Rush\">San Francisco Rush</a>. Simply by picking up icons, players or even NPC's can reform the land to make shortcuts and ramps. The game encourages the players' use of turbo, and even emphasizes chaotic driving through its overuse. Some stunts may even be rewarded by more boost or a power-up.</p>\n<p>Pulling off these maneuvers is not just a feature, but a core mechanic that is used to progress through the game. Like the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Burnout\">Burnout</a> series, performing death-defying stunts not only benefits the player, but rewards them with \"star points\". These points are what actually unlocks new modes and races. While coming in first place is important to earn more star points, it may not be necessary if the player drives crazy enough during the race.</p>\n<p>Using an SD card, the game's soundtrack can be customized with MP3s.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Trauma Center: Second Opinion</em> the player plays the part of Derek Stiles, a doctor who has just completed his residency at Hope Hospital and is now a full time surgeon. The story takes place in the year 2018; by this time a lot of diseases thought incurable have been cured, but people still get sick and are involved in accidents requiring attention of doctors such as Stiles. Dr. Stiles career begins rather normally with a series of routine surgeries to get warmed up. Later though it's discovered that Dr. Stiles has the \"healing touch\", a rare ability he can use to slow down time to perform surgery faster while maintaining accuracy. This ability becomes important as a new, deadly disease begins spreading...</p>\n<p><em>Trauma Center: Second Opinion</em> is a remake of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/20582/trauma-center-under-the-knife/\">Trauma Center: Under the Knife</a> for the Nintendo DS. The gameplay remains similar, though it has been updated to utilize the Wii's remote and Nunchuk as well as including some new missions and other additions. Each mission is presented in a 1st-person point of view where the player needs to successfully complete the surgery required by the patient. Time is limited, and they need to make sure they don't make too many mistakes! Sometimes the procedure can be straightforward, but often there will be unexpected surprises to deal with. To perform surgery there are a variety of tools at the player's disposal which can be selected with the Nunchuk; these include scalpels, forceps, surgical lasers, bandages, syringes, antibiotics, and many more. The Wii remote is used to perform an action with the selected tool. During surgery the player's assistant will provide advice to help them complete each procedure required. After each mission they are given a rating on how well they performed; this is affected by how quickly the surgery was performed as well as how accurately. As missions are completed, new ones become available or they can retry missions to earn a better grade. The games story unfolds as the player's progresses through the various missions.</p>",

The game is more linear than the previous 3D adventures, hearkening back to the more straightforward \"reach the goal\" mechanics of the earlier side-scrolling titles. For gameplay, the wiimote is held sideways like a regular controller. By tilting left or right, Sonic follows the direction. Certain movements and buttons allow Sonic to slow down or perform moves. Similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=010086690019\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> (2006), Sonic can acquire more than 100 new skills, and even combine them, gained along with experience. Before each stage, players select the desired skills for the mission.</p>\n<p>There are 3 game modes: Adventure (the main game with 8 stages), Party and Special Book. In Special Book, there are more than 200 extras to be unlocked when Sonic completes specific goals. The Party mode supports up to 4 players on a game board, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4604/sonic-shuffle/\">Sonic Shuffle</a>. The gameplay itself consists of 40 mini-games, each with different controls for the wiimote.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>SSX Blur</em> is a snowboarding / skiing game with gameplay similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=SSX+3\">SSX 3</a>. Once again there are three mountain peaks to explore; the main game is a career mode which initially begins on peak 1, to unlock the remaining peaks you'll need to successfully complete events. The events you'll find on the mountain include races, slopestyle competitions, big air events, assorted challenges, and more. Also available is a quick play mode where you can jump straight to some events and multiplayer modes.</p>\n<p>As you make your way down the mountain you can perform a variety of tricks; these can be simple grabs, or tougher jumps, rail slides and spins. A successful trick will fill up your groove meter; once the groove meter is filled, you can perform an ubertrick. Ubertricks are the toughest tricks to pull off, but earn the most points. In addition to ubertricks, the groove meter can also be used for a speed boost. The game is played with both the Wii remote and the nunchuk. The nunchuk is utilized for accelerating/braking, carving, grabs, and jumps while the remote is used to perform flips, spins, and other tricks. Performing tricks requires tilting/moving the Wii remote in the appropriate direction, and ubertricks may additionally require drawing various shapes with the remote. Many ubertricks are available initially, however additional tricks need to be unlocked.</p>\n<p>As you race down the mountain you'll encounter various collectibles; by running into enough of these icons you can unlock additional ubertricks. Using the Wii remote you also have the ability to throw snowballs, an ability which can prove useful in races by slowing down your opponents; you'll need to be careful though to make sure you don't knock yourself off balance!</p>\n<p>The game features a variety of characters you can control, many have appeared in other games in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/1660/ssx-series/\">SSX Series</a> while a few are new to this game. Only a few characters are available initially, others will need to be unlocked by progressing through the games career mode.</p>",

Each level can be replayed infinitely to improve the time.</p>\n<p>The \"balls\" are not really balls but cute creatures, such as a ladybug, a fluffy cat, and a watermelon. They have different characteristics e.g response time, speed, and bounciness. The mazes get increasingly complex and can require the player to turn the controller upside down. There are 50 levels in five different environments, each with specific a visual style, music, and obstacles.</p>\n<p>Contains a split-screen multiplayer mode.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Mario and friends are invited to the Star Carnival. Of course, they are thrilled to join. Whoever wins the main event, the Star Battle, receives a year's supply of candy. To win they must play through board games against each other. Mario and pals can also choose to play a more traditional party (much like other <a href=\"/game-group/mario-party-series\">Mario Party games</a>).</p>\n<p>In the first Mario Party game for Wii, the basic rules are the same: players still compete to win stars. However, the mini-games have been completely revamped to take advantage of the Wii remote. For example, some have players point the remote at the screen to shoot guns or other such things. Other mini-games use the motion sensor to shake soda cans, cut logs in half, hammer nails in place, paint, fly planes, drive cars, etc. There are still others that are played more traditionally by holding the Wii remote on its side and using the control pad to move and the buttons to perform actions, such as jumping and/or punching.</p>\n<p>Players can choose between five different modes: Party Tent, Star Battle, Mini-games, Extras Zone, or Fun Bazaar. In Party Tent mode, players play on boards with a choice between battle royales, teams, or duels. In a Battle Royale, people compete for stars: the winner is determined by number of stars and/or coins after a certain amount of turns. In Team Battle, players split off into teams. And in a duel, two players compete against each other.</p>\n<p>Star Battle is basically a duel on each board against different characters (for one player). The player wins each board by completing a certain task. For instance, the player must collect so many stars on some boards. For other boards, he or she has to get to the star with a certain amount of coins.</p>",

Much like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/22519/big-brain-academy/\">Big Brain Academy</a> you are tested in five major brain activity areas: identify, memorize, analyze, compute, and visualize. The object is to measure your brain and to increase the size of it through practice sessions. By using the Wiimote you have to point at the screen to make your selections.</p>\n<p><strong>The Activities:</strong>  </p>\n<p>In each of the 5 mental categories you have 3 activities to flex your brain.</p>\n<p><em>Identify</em>  </p>\n<p>Whack Match - you'll be shown objects and you have to whack the mole with the matching object  </p>\n<p>Fast Focus - you'll get a scrambled picture that'll come into focus and you have to decide which object it is  </p>\n<p>Species Spotlight - use the Wiimote like a flashlight to identify the animals you see</p>\n<p><em>Memorize</em>  </p>\n<p>Covered Cage - you'll get some birds in cages and you'll have to find where they are ala the shell game  </p>\n<p>Face Case - remember the face(s) you see and match with the question you're given  </p>\n<p>Reverse Retention - given a set of sounds, you have to play them back in reverse</p>\n<p><em>Analyze</em>  </p>\n<p>Match Blast - given a key at the top you have to make your picture look the same by blasting what needs to be removed  </p>\n<p>Speed Sorting - read the statement and answer by clicking the right picture  </p>\n<p>Block Spot - given a key block you have to choose which one matches it</p>\n<p><em>Compute</em>  </p>\n<p>Balloon Burst - read the statement and pop the balloons in the order called for  </p>\n<p>Mallet Math - given a number, you have to knock the blocks to make the numbers match it  </p>\n<p>Color Count - count the balls going in to determine the score</p>\n<p><em>Visualize</em>  </p>\n<p>Art Parts - given a key, you have to place objects to match  </p>\n<p>Train Turn - place your turn pieces to get the train to the end  </p>\n<p>Odd One Out - given a set of pictures you have to determine which is different</p>\n<p><strong>Modes of play:</strong>  </p>\n<p>You can test and increase your skills in the solo mode of the game and when you're ready to take on your friends you can go to the group mode.</p>\n<p><strong>Solo Mode</strong>  </p>\n<p>The test portion runs you through 15 activities within the 5 mental categories. For each activity you'll start out easy and if you're accurate and quick in solving it you'll be taken to the next level that particular activity shows up again, but if you fail or just aren't that fast you'll either stay the same or get bumped back down a level. At the end of the testing you'll be given your total brain weight, a letter grade and a career in which fits the brain weight you reached.</p>\n<p>The practice portion lets you practice each of the activities within each of the 5 mental categories. For each activity you can practice at the easy, medium, and hard levels. There are four medal classes you can reach that is dependent on the weight of your brain for that activity. You have bronze, silver, gold, and for the truly out of the norm brain you have the platinum medal.</p>\n<p><strong>Group Mode</strong>  </p>\n<p>Ready to show how big your brain is to friends? It's time to compete by yourself or in teams.</p>\n<p>Mind Spring - two teams race to answer a set of problems  </p>\n<p>Mental Marathon - try to keep a perfect winning streak going as long as possible in a given time  </p>\n<p>Brain Quiz - party style game that goes through the 5 mental categories and different skill levels</p>\n<p>Check your skills - with the Mii profiles you can check and compare your scores and medals that each person has achieved.</p>\n<p>Remember, the key to the game is being fast and accurate.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the third and final outing of the Metroid Prime series, bounty hunter Samus Aran is contacted by the Galactic Federation to discover why a computer network, known as the \"Aurora Unit\", has started to malfunction. The Federation believes it is the work of their long-time nemesis, the Space Pirates, and dispatches Samus to investigate the situation. </p>\n<p><em>Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</em> is a first-person action game that spans the course of several planets. Along the way, Samus meets with Federation members and other bounty hunters. Samus also runs into many old foes; one such foe, Dark Samus, corrupts her with Phazon energy that increases her powers via a PED (Phazon Enhancement Device). She can choose when to use this energy, but the Phazon will kill her if used for longer than a certain time period. </p>\n<p>Gameplay is set within several 3D worlds, following the traditional Metroid formula of finding various armor and weapon upgrades to use, exploring areas, fighting numerous bosses, and avoiding environmental dangers. Although the game contains several action-heavy sequences involving firepower, the game's main focus stays with using new items at various locations to discover previously unexplored areas.</p>\n<p>The play control has been reworked to take advantage of the Wii's capabilities. For instance, players point the Wii Remote to aim Samus's arm cannon. The Nunchuk accessory is used for grappling objects; this grapple ability can be used to pull obstacles out of the way, grab an enemy's shield from its grip, or to swing across a gap. Samus can also use the Morph Ball to roll through small spaces or to escape enemies; Samus can even jump while in Morph Ball form without using bombs. Additionally, Samus can call her gunship to assist in battles, travel to other planets, or provide a mobile save point.</p>\n<p>Also new to the series are a collection of \"Achievements\", which can be unlocked by performing various tasks, such as killing a certain number of enemies, or scanning certain objects. The Achievements can also be shared with friends via WiiConnect24, by posting photos, or unlocking other special bonuses.</p>",

The game's plot traces decades of war among six factions (Solar Empire, Western Frontier, Anglo Isles, Iron Legion, Tundran Territories, Xylvania), and unfolds through contemporary missions that advance the conflict and flashback missions that reveal its history.</p>\n<p>Players control a soldier or a land, sea, or air vehicle to engage in combat directly and to command other units. The Wii Remote is used to target and fire, but selecting and ordering units is performed through conventional button presses. The Wii Nunchuk's thumbstick controls player movement, and evasive maneuvers are handled through gestures.</p>\n<p>In the single-player campaign mode, the player assumes control of the various factions at different points in the conflict's history. The game also features three online multiplayer modes. Skirmish mode is a timed two-player match to score more points than the other player by destroying opposing units. Assault mode is a timed two-player match in which one player attempts to destroy the other player's resources and fortifications while the other defends. Co-Op mode is an untimed two-player match in which both players work together to complete special online missions that are not part of the single-player campaign. Offline local multiplayer is not supported.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Endless Ocean</em> is the third installment in the Everblue series, games focused on exploring an underwater world. The main focus of the game is exploration of the game world and cataloguing the various species of animals found there. <em>Endless Ocean</em> slightly differs from its predecessors in that the traditional \"game elements\" have been mostly removed - where <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/11967/everblue-2/\">Everblue 2</a> set a goal for the player by having them search for treasure underwater, <em>Endless Ocean</em> is more freeform and just lets the player explore at their own pace. There are still treasures to find, but as <em>Endless Ocean</em> is mostly freeform exploration and has no overarching plot, the player is in no obligation to look for these items to progress through the game.</p>\n<p>Unlike in the similar <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3653/aquanauts-holiday/\">Aquanaut's Holiday</a>, only a small area of the full game world is seamlessly accessible at any one time. Diving tours are limited to a certain area around the player's boat, which can be freely moved about a map of the whole game world. This allows the player to choose for themselves the area of the game world they can access without having to bear loading times; however it is not possible to move from one play area to another without returning to the boat and using the map to move it around.</p>\n<p>The game keeps track of the species of animals encountered and examined in three levels of detail - no information and three small pieces of information on each species. The animals are mostly marine life - fish, dolphins, whales, sea lions - but also include various coastal and marine birds, such as penguins and pelicans. There are a number of extra features that unlock during the first few hours of gameplay, including night diving, an underwater camera/photo album and an aquarium the player can populate with species of animals they've encountered in the open sea.</p>\n<p>This title also adds online multiplayer to the series, allowing for players to use Nintendo's WFC service to go diving together. The game does not use the Wii system's built-in friend code but instead generates its own, requiring players to keep a separate friend list for the game.</p>",

Extra points are awarded for shooting certain background items, bombs destroy everything on the screen, food can be picked up to refill energy (Arcade) and clocks add more time (Classic).</p>\n<p>The game uses hand-drawn graphics. There are different settings, such as the desert and Antarctica, and three game modes with different difficulty levels, but quite similar. In single-player, there is Arcade (shoot a specific number of chickens), Classic (time limit) and Catch an Egg (a mini-game where eggs need to be caught before they drop on the ground). The first two can also be played in split-screen multiplayer.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Balls of Fury</em> is a table tennis game based on the movie of the same name. </p>\n<p>The game comes with four modes: Exhibition, Arcade (a series of elimination matches), Tournament (a four or eight-person elimination tournament), or Story. In the last mode, players assume the role of Randy Daytona and the game follows the events of the movie. The player starts in his youth and the story unfolds through cut-scenes between matches, moving on to his adult life.</p>\n<p>Controlled through the Wii remote, players mimic the motions of table tennis to perform shots, slams, lobs. Spin can be added as well and by moving the controller diagonally, shots can be combined into combos, to slam or lob left or right. Each player has two power moves. These make the ball burst into flames or make it follow an irregular pattern. Compared to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/22531/rockstar-games-presents-table-tennis/\">Rockstar Games presents Table Tennis</a> the game is less of a simulation. Each player has a power move for serving and volleys. To perform them, a power bar is needed and these are refilled by volleying back and forth with the opponent.</p>\n<p>Additionally, players can use taunts to distract the opponent. Next to a line of dialogue, it shakes the player's camera and rumbles the Wii remote. There are ten characters to choose from (Randy Daytona, Maggie, Feng, The Dragon, Freddy \"Fingers\" Wilson, Yukito Nagasaki, Karl Wolfschtagg, Master Wong, Young Randy, and The Hammer), but only the first six are available right way. The other characters need to be unlocked by performing well, along with ten trophies that are added to the trophy room.</p>\n<p>In certain modes the match settings can be changed and there are three difficulty levels and six venues in total (Korean Olympic Gym, Reno Middle School, Master Wong's Training School, Chinatown Gym, Feng's Tournament Room, and Feng's Rec Room).</p>",

The game introduces two children, William and Helen, and in their dreams the game takes place. The player controls the children and also Nights, a Nightmaren that turned against his creator in the previous game, and must protect the children's dreams from the Nightmaren.</p>\n<p>The game begins with choosing a dreamer to play (William or Helen) and one of the seven worlds. The player can initially roam the world as the dreamer until he merges with Nights. Once Nights is controlled, the game turns to the traditional gameplay of gliding and spiraling through loops and collecting orbs and Dreamdrops.</p>\n<p>During the game the player can obtain Persona Masks used to transform Nights into various animals and vehicles like a dragon, a dolphin, a rocket and a boat. These masks assist the player in reaching areas not accessible otherwise.</p>\n<p>The game uses the Forecast Channel on the Wii to change the in-game weather conditions according to the weather at the geographic location of the player in the real world. That feature also comes to use in My Dream, a sandbox environment used to raise Nightmaren and other various creatures of Nightopia.</p>\n<p>The game has four controls schemes: the Wii Remote, the Wii Remote with the Nunchuk, the GameCube controller and the Classic Controller. Players can keep track of their global ranking in an online scoreboard as the game informs the player of his global rank when playing.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This is a straightforward racing game controlling the famous candy coated chocolate pieces in karts. There are four game modes: Quick Race, Training, Arcade and Tournament. There are different karts and courses to choose from, and some of them have to be unlocked in the Tournament mode first. Karts' statistics are based on speed, acceleration, handling and stability. While racing players earn points by finishing first, performing stunts and collecting coins and chocolate chips. These can be exchanged in the garage to upgrade the vehicle or buy a new kart.</p>\n<p>There are fifteen courses in total. Controlling the karts is done through the Wii remote (acceleration, brake, movement). Raising the remote lets the karts jump and doing it twice, quickly, leads to a double jump or a two-wheel stunt drive on ramps. Spinning the Wii remote at the start allows for a turbo start. The game can be played in split-screen multiplayer in two modes: Quick Race (one lap) and Full Throttle (three laps).</p>",

The game takes place ten years after the events of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/25357/trauma-center-second-opinion/\">Trauma Center: Second Opinion</a>, featuring the two surgeons Markus Vaughn and Valerie Blaylock. The storyline centers around a parasite called Sigma. The perform surgery on Professor Wilkens, an old acquaintance who is infected, but after the operation he is kidnapped and all information about the disease is stolen.</p>\n<p>Players can call in a colleague to assist with the onslaught of challenging surgeries to perform (full co-op mode). The Wiimote is used to make incisions, apply antibiotic gel, sew sutures and unleash the mystical powers of the \"healing touch\" to save the lives entrusted to the player's care. In the Challenge missions players need to treat a set amount of patients in a limited time. The X-missions, available after beating the game once, also make a return.</p>\n<p>In single player or co-op, players can choose to control either Markus or Valerie. Some single-player missions force the player to use one doctor or the other. Aside from some dialogue changes, the only real difference between the two doctors are their slightly different versions of the Healing Touch. Markus' slows down time, similar to the previous Trauma games, allowing the player to treat an overwhelming amount of injuries in before the patient's vitals can drop. Valerie's freezes the patient's vitals entirely for a short period, allowing the player to focus entirely on the operation. However, vitals can not be improved while Valerie's Touch is active. Stats (like performance rankings) are also tracked separately for each of the two doctors, encouraging at least one repeat play of each mission.</p>",

A new Extreme mode is unlockable for <em>The House of the Dead III</em>, with faster enemy attacks and smaller bullet blast radii for the player's guns (similar to the handgun in the second game). At the same time, the shotgun can be reloaded much faster and a new melee attack is introduced: Guard Attack. It is a powerful move that also blocks incoming attacks, but requires a \"reload\" time.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Super Smash Bros.: Brawl</em> is the third game in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/508/super-smash-brothers-series/\">Super Smash Brothers series</a> of brawling games. It is a crossover fighting pitching well-known characters from Nintendo franchises, along with characters from other series, against each other. The battles take place in 41 stages with up to four players fighting at the same time. New stages can be designed using the included Stage Builder. Unlike other fighting games, players do not need to drain the opponent's health. Instead, the game is won when a player manages to knock the opponent off the stage, although some games modes only award a point to the victorious player, continuing the fight. The fighting itself does have an influence however. The character's vitality is represented by a percentage. Starting at zero, the higher it becomes, the further the character flies away when hit, improving the chances to have him disappear off the stage. Characters have certain recovery moves to get back, but each stage has a certain boundary from where no return is possible.</p>\n<p>Each character has basic and advanced attacks (smash attacks), as well as character-specific special moves. They can also make use of items, projectiles, custom weapons and other items. This edition introduces super attacks referred to as final smashes. Activated by destroying smash balls, these feature powerful and often unstoppable attacks, regularly introducing a major transformation of the character. Other help is introduced through assist trophies (a computer-controlled character temporarily helping out) and Pok\u00e9 balls (a character from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/475/pokemon-universe/\">Pok\u00e9mon universe</a> joins the fight).</p>\n<p>The single-player mode is called <em>The Subspace Emissary</em> and features cut-scenes with all playable characters. It is team-based, and new characters will temporarily join or leave the team for which the player can determine the battle order. Other modes include Classic (a series of matches), Events with pre-determined battle conditions - also for co-op, and the Stadium mode with mini-games such as Home-Run Contest and Target Smash!</p>\n<p>There are 35 playable characters in total (both old and new, with some removed from previous iterations), and certain characters can acquire alternate fighting styles or transformations making a total of 37 selectable.

As a mercenary following the orders of various warlords such as Nobunaga Oda, the player hacks and slashes through hordes of enemy soldiers and commanders. The various characters of the Samurai Warriors game make appearances through various missions, either as allies or enemies.</p>\n<p>The game relies on the Wii Remote and Nunchuk movements for attack commands as the player is automatically moved through the stages through Arcade-like camera movement. The game allows for eight different weapons to use and customize. The weapon list includes a Katana, a Bow, a Musket, a Spear, as well as four other weapons. To upgrade the weapons, the player can either win new ones by completing missions, or buy stats to add to the weapons in the shop.</p>\n<p>The game also offers mini-games that can be played in two-player mode. In these mini-games, money that can be used to boost the character or the weapon's stats is rewarded by successfully completing short missions.</p>\n<p>In story mode, the battles are separated in various parts in which certain goals must be achieved in order to clear it. Upon ending these missions, a grade (from E to S) based on completion time, rewards obtained and damage taken, is awarded to the player. Each battle can be redone multiple times, be it to obtain more money, better weapons, new skills or simply to get a better grade. Unlike Dynasty or Samurai Warriors games, the missions are rather short, so it is possible to play for only a small amount of time.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mario Kart Wii</em> is an installment of the long-running Mario Kart series, but here for the Nintendo Wii, where you take control of various Nintendo characters to race through different tracks and win the Grand Prix, using a variety of vehicles and items spread through the track to help you.</p>\n<p>There are various additions to the series. Players can now also play with motorbikes, which can do wheelies but are lighter and can't super boost, in contrast with karts. There's 6 varieties of each for each character class to choose from, and 4 new characters have been added as well as being able to drive with your Mii. Finally, there's 16 new tracks as well as 16 returning from previous games.</p>\n<p>Gameplay has also been modified. Drifting has been tweaked so that it's easier to use and players only get a turbo boost based on how well they perform the drift. It can be set to Manual, where players press a button to drift, or Automatic, where it's automatically triggered on curves but provides no turbo boost. Stunts can also be performed in the air to gain turbo boosts. Races have also been bolstered to support up to 12 players now.</p>\n<p>There's 4 modes of play to choose from: Grand Prix, where you race through series of tracks in the 50cc (karts only), 100cc (bikes only) and 150cc (karts and bikes) cups; Time Trial, where you take on ghost replays and try to finish in the least time; Versus, where you race against opponents on a single track; and Battle, where you can compete against your foes in either hitting them with weapons or collecting coins.</p>\n<p>Multiplayer is also supported, allowing up to 4 players in hotseat and 12 online on Nintendo Wi-Fi, where you can take on strangers and friends (with Friend Codes) in any game mode, play in competitions, beat other's ghost replays or check online rankings. The game can be played using a Wii Wheel (included), Wii Remote, Nunchuck, Classic Controller, or Gamecube Controller.</p>",

Crypto and his mentor Orthopox attempt to exploit the popularity of Big Willy, a fast food restaurant owned by Pox. His secret recipe is actually human meat, served from the dead bodies that were left behind after Crypto got their brain stems. A kidnapped heiress by the name of Patty Wurst has discovered the secret recipe of the restaurant, and Crypto and Pox set on an adventure to stop her before she can expose them.</p>\n<p>The game is set in the 1970s. There is now a third way to unleash fury besides on foot and in a UFO aircraft: a Big Willy Machine! There are five different places to explore: Harbor City, Fairfield, Vietmahl, Fantasy Island, and Antarctica. There are futuristic weapons and unique mental abilities. It wouldn't be a <em>Destroy all Humans!</em> game without humor and over the top, non-stop action. Popular abilities such as Psychokinesis and Body Snatch return as well as Crypto's Zap-O-Matic and Disintegrator Ray. New abilites include the saucer's Electro-Cone and Quantum Deconstructor. Crypto also has new guns, including the Ball Lightning and a zombie gun that turns its victims into zombies.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>My Life as a King</em> takes place after the GameCube's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Final+Fantasy+Crystal+Chronicles\">Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles</a> and it is the third game in the Chronicles series. Whereas in that game the player fought to rid the world of the deadly miasma covering it, in this game a land previously lost to the miasma is recovered and ripe for rebuilding. Your purpose is to rebuild a prosperous kingdom with the magic power of architek, and along the way find out what happened to the previous king: your father.</p>\n<p>Rather than controlling an adventurer or group of adventurers as in most Final Fantasy games, in <em>My Life as a King</em> you only have indirect control over such people. As king you can hire people to become adventurers, who can then choose to go on behests. Behests are essentially missions with bounties. Every day some of the adventurers will gather around the behest boards and wait for the king to tell them if they should attempt it or not. These missions will bring in the necessary resources of money and elementite, as well as knowledge of new lands and types of buildings.</p>\n<p>To build the town, the king uses his power of architek and a limited amount of elementite to create buildings. Some will house people, and can be used to supply adventurers and money through tithes. Others will be shops adventurers will make purchases from, and at which the king can fund development of new products. Some will be schools to teach magic or skills the adventurers can learn from; also at which the king can fund new developments. Non-adventurer shops will keep the citizenry happy.</p>\n<p>Game action is split into days. At the beginning of each day you can read logs of what the adventurers did the previous day, down to specifics of what happened in each turn of the off-screen battles they had if you wish. You then set behests, after which you are free to walk around the kingdom for the rest of the day and take pertinent actions such as creating buildings, funding research, approving adventurers for behests, or simply talking to the townspeople to keep up morale.</p>",

There are plenty of categories and up to 20,000 questions for virtually endless hours of play. Also you must use the Wii remote in a way to buzz in to answer the questions and also to spin a wheel to determine the next category and supports up to four-player simultaneous play.</p>",

You can also use the button mode, which features a bar at the button, pressing the \"A\" button once sets up your power and hitting it again will determine your accuracy.</p>\n<p>The singles modes include a new Tour Mode, which replaces the story mode, that shows a map of the world and lets you pick the tournaments that you are offered instead of in a set pattern and resembles more of a game board, similar to Mario Party, facing an opponent towards the end to unlock the next area, playing short games of golf along with minigames like bullseye.</p>\n<p>Completing these tournaments lets you unlock new items you can use for your golfers and even hidden Tecmo characters.  To unlock these items, you must collect coins throughout the tournaments by completing certain tasks, allowing you to unlock them.  </p>\n<p>You can also play practice games or playing a round of golf against the CPU.  There is party mode which can support multiple players and include games like Nearest to the Pin, where you see who's golf ball can get closer to the hole, Longest Drive which is pretty much self explanatory and Golf Darts.</p>",

Two other characters assist the player throughout the adventure, Fleurette and Alance. Incidentally all three of the NPCs are named after swords.</p>\n<p>The player sets their level of participation, mainly though how often they cast magic. The player only uses standard physical attacks and a \"Master Stroke\" special attack when their power meter is full.</p>\n<p>The game is a true Rail Shooter style, with monsters appearing in the same positions each play through.</p>",

Pills with two halves of random color are dropped, and the player tries to align them with germs of the same color. Four or more of the same color in a row (any combination of germs and pill halves) and all in the line will disappear. Gameplay continues until the player clears the field of germs, or pills pile to the top.</p>\n<p>The game features offline and online one-on-one multiplayer modes. There's Classic versus mode with the same win conditions as the single-player mode; as well as Flash, where the winner is the first one to eliminate their flashing germs. Online play can be against random players or those on a friends list. A friend with a Wii but not a copy of <em>Dr. Mario Online Rx</em> can be sent an invitation to download a demo version that's only usable to play against people with the full copy.</p>\n<p>A variant of <em>Dr. Mario</em> called <em>Virus Buster</em> is available for offline play, 1-4 players cooperative. First seen in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Brain+Age+2\">Brain Age 2</a> as a stylus-controlled version of <em>Dr. Mario</em>, now the Wii Remote's pointer is used to grab and move pills, with the B button used to rotate them. Pills and germs display much larger in this mode.</p>",

Along come Mike, the typical confident college playboy and Ray, a freshman in college. Arriving on the island, Mike and Ray fight over Michelle who then runs off into the foggy distance and is nowhere to be found. Now Ray needs to find Michelle and get off the island in one piece.</p>\n<p>The player takes over the control of Ray in this <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Resident+Evil\">Resident Evil</a>-inspired survival horror game and sees him from behind. On his journey into the unknown, Ray finds several different kinds of weapons from a simple stick to a machete and even a very helpful bug spray to fend off the many enemies. But these aren't limited to just nasty bugs but also include giant gorillas or strange lizard-women and the occasional boss fight against 10-foot-tall praying mantises and other similar screen-filling monstrosities. Each monster has different weaknesses and also drops purple fragments when killed. If the player collects enough of these, a special box will appear in the level which holds different useful items (usually weapons).</p>",

There are 5 game modes, which include Quickplay (1P), Quickplay (2P), Challenge, Quest, and Multiplayer. Quickplay (1P) is just the basic gameplay. Quickplay (2P) is the same as the prior, only with 2 players. Challenge gets harder as the game goes on, and you play until you lose. Quest has a variety of puzzles to chose from with bosses.

The concept is however different because it focuses on a clash between bands with different styles. Also no external peripherals are used, only the regular controllers.</p>\n<p>At the start of the game, players choose a band and a music style (Country, Marching, Latin, Hip Hop or Rock). The game contains cover versions of 30 popular songs of which each one has five different versions based on the aforementioned styles. The notes scroll up from the bottom of the screen near the top and players need to swing the Wiimote in the right direction at the right moment. The game is always played against another opponent (human or computer) with a similar playfield on the other side of the screen. Both players play the same song, but with a different style. Based on the performance, the style of the player performing best is heard dominantly. When the other player improves, the volume is adjusted into the other direction and as such the song is constantly mixed based on the different styles.</p>\n<p>Contrary to contemporary music games, missing a note does not influence the music itself, only the shift in volume towards a certain player. There are also different attacks to use while playing. The opponent's screen can be covered in smoke, have their controls reversed, or notes can even be shrunken or flipped around. There are also certain Face Off instances where the players take turns playing a part, launching attacks, while the other player can block through syncing.</p>",

Each courses has a different look and feel to it, each with their own set of challenging obstacles.</p>\n<p>There is a career mode, where players can not only play as characters designed for the game, but also play classic Capcom characters such as Chun-Li and Jill Valentine. There is also a 4-player party mode and a <strong>\"World Party\"</strong> mode, where players can go online with the Mii's and challenge other players and winning medals for their troubles.

While on a vacation with his family from his home planet Tizia, crash land on a mysterious planet called Landroll. When he awakes he finds out his parents are seriously injured and being taken care of at a local hospital and his brother and sister are somewhere lost on the vast planet.</p>\n<p>After learning of his predicament, Opoona is determined to find them, but to travel from colony to colony on the planet, he must first obtain a license from the bureaucratic-choked colonies to travel between them. To do this, he must complete jobs in each colony, anything from fishing, a park ranger, a fortune teller, janitorial work to even fighting monsters like evil flat screen TVs.</p>\n<p>To find these jobs, the player must travel around the homes, striking conversations with the people, making new friends and taking the odd jobs from them. The controls mostly consist of the Wii-remote to move around and the nunchuk to target enemies. To do this the player uses the nunchuk to target their enemy, set the trajectory and snap the nunchuk forwards to fling energy \"bon-bons\" at their opponents.</p>\n<p>The player can also use money obtained through the various odd jobs to shop and collect various items throughout the planet, anything from toys to even great pieces of art. There is also a \"friend-of-nature\" theme, where the world of Landroll is in balance with the planet, combining nature and modern structures along with beautiful scenery such as jungles, ancient ruins and large forests.</p>",

The ranch is run by Hayley, a friend of Bebe (the person responsible for Pok\u00e9mon storage in the portable games). She gives the player six starter Pok\u00e9mon and one new Pok\u00e9mon every day that the player logs in to the Ranch.</p>\n<p><em>My Pok\u00e9mon Ranch</em> features DS connectivity: up to eight players with Pok\u00e9mon Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum can transfer their Pok\u00e9mon to and from the Ranch. Once the Pok\u00e9mon have been transferred to the Ranch, they cannot be levelled further. As the number of Pok\u00e9mon on the Ranch increases, the Ranch size increases and features are unlocked. Hayley will trade Pok\u00e9mon in her possession to a DS trainer; the rarity of the Pok\u00e9mon depends on the number of Pokemon in the Ranch.</p>\n<p>The player moves the camera to watch his or her Pok\u00e9mon interacting with each other, with toys, and with Miis. Screenshots may be taken and sent to registered friends, or downloaded to SD cards. Pok\u00e9mon can be picked up and dropped on to things, but can't be made to interact with anything, however, they just might get the right idea. Essentially, <em>My Pok\u00e9mon Ranch</em> is a Mii Plaza for Pok\u00e9mon enthusiasts.</p>",

Players can also destroy their city with a variety of disasters like meteors, fires, floods, earthquakes and monsters.</p>\n<p>However, what makes this version different from its counterparts is the interface and the way the player can build their city through the Wii Remote. Players use the remote to draw roads, making them as straight or as curvy as they want and even make the shape of a neighborhood as they see fit. Additionally, the player can use the remote to destroy their creation such as using the remote by spinning it vertically to create a whirlwind or slam down like a hammer on a particular building to annihilate it.</p>\n<p>Assistants can also be hired to help them run the city as well as help with the construction of the city and players can even take a view of their city by means of airplane or helicopter to view their master creation.</p>",

The way the ball goes depends on how hard you it it, so if you hit it hard, it would go to the left, soft, to the right, and in the middle, straight ahead. There are also mini-games you can play, Target TT, Thrilling TT, and Matching TT.</p>",

Not all the spirits are hostile; the player is expected to differentiate between them, and also capture pictures with the camera to gather clues and advance in the game. Spirit Crystals can be collected and used to upgrade the camera and the flashlight. Healing items and films can be purchased in special shop-like locations.</p>",

As in the previous version, players assume the role of a new resident in a town populated and run by animals. Players can interact with townsfolk, write letters, send presents, dig for fossils, fish, catch bugs, etc... Time in the game uses the internal Wii's clock and calendar. As such, time and seasons happen at the same time as in real life. Therefore, some events only happen at a certain day of the week, or even on special days in the year (such as Christmas on December 25th).</p>\n<p>Additions include a city center, with some new shops and some others which were already in the previous instalments. The game also uses the Wi-Fi connection with the classical Nintendo's \"codes\": players are able to visit their friend's village. The game is compatible with the Wii Speak system, which means players can use the microphone to speak with each other.</p>",

It is only after a severe earthquake that he is called upon once again for his rescuing and emergency response expertise.</p>\n<p>As Bryce, players view the game in a third-person view, and manoeuvre the character through many different environments in order to both track down a mysterious armed group, as well as find and rescue civilians caught up in the various environmental disasters that are unfolding.</p>\n<p>By searching, calling-out to and rescuing non-playable characters, Bryce accumulates points that allow him to both unlock, upgrade and \"buy\" items that become available after certain set events. Further to this, players can then upgrade Raymond's skills directly. Strength, stamina and weapon skills are some of the available areas that can be improved.</p>\n<p>Control in this game is varied. Apart from the more traditional over-the-shoulder perspective and control, Bryce may need to sprint and run towards the camera, he may need to swim and avoid underwater obstacles, he may need to perform basic first-aid on civilians, and he more commonly is involved in frantic shoot-outs. These segments of the game resemble the gameplay style of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3568/time-crisis/\">Time Crisis</a>, where players may take cover and then emerge to fire upon many armed combatants. Bryce's arsenal is varied as well.</p>\n<p>Within the various city and urban environments, Bryce needs to react accordingly to each given situation, and players are prompted beforehand on what particular control-method will need be employed via on-screen \"help\". He is called upon to use fire-extinguishers, drive different vehicles (away and towards the camera), and operate panels, doors and a multitude of life-like objects.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Shaun White Snowboarding: Road Trip</em> is a separate release from the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions called <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=3307211605688\">Shaun White Snowboarding</a>. Making full use of the Wii Balance Board accessory, <em>Road Trip</em> allows players to hit the slopes in a more dynamic way. By using the Balance Board as a virtual snowboard, players can ride the various runs and perform tricks and other techniques such as carving, grinding and speed-boosting.</p>\n<p>As with many snowboarding games, there are numerous riders with various skills and abilities to unlock and choose from. But unique to this title is the choice of a cameraman companion. This second character films your run from behind you and also provides a particular momentary power-up. This may be a Speed Boost, Jump Boost or Trick Boost etc.</p>\n<p>On your road trip, you will visit many locations and continents. In a sense, you're following the trail of Shaun White himself. This is demonstrated when he makes occasional calls to your mobile phone and updates you on his new location. You're physically one location behind him, and need to complete certain runs and objectives in order to progress to the next location, whether it is Canada, Japan, Switzerland and many other exotic and snow-capped places.</p>\n<p>The game also supports play without the use of the Balance Board and requires motion-gesture input from the Wii remote. Various motions correspond to certain tricks and manoeuvres while button combinations alter the motions to achieve more advanced trick techniques.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Deadly Creatures</em>, the player alternates between controlling a spider and a scorpion on their quest through a world from their unique viewpoint just above the ground. The game's mysterious story follows two humans, always up above the critters and takes place in the desert and a gas station.</p>\n<p>The game is essentially a fighting game, with the Wii-remote and nun-chuck being used for various special moves to defeat the mostly insect foes. During the course of the game, points are earned for defeating enemies, which in turn unlock new moves for both the spider and the scorpion. Each of the animals has its own distinct moves. For example, the spider can shoot webs or jump, while the scorpion uses its deadly sting and digs through holes in the walls. Also, the level design leans heavily on the ability of both creatures to walk along walls.</p>\n<p>Within each stage, there are several save points, usually just before a boss fight. Health is replenished by eating grass hoppers. Regular ones only restore a small amount of health, while the rare green ones increase the maximum health of the animal. Grubs can also be found all over the levels, eating a certain number of them gradually unlocks bonus concept art galleries.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Sandy Beach</em> is a relaxation game released through the Nintendo WiiWare service for the Wii. Up to two players can build castles on the coastline of Sandy Beach. There are three modes of play. The first is a sandbox mode that allows the user to construct any sandcastle they want using their Wii Remote to scoop, dump, and shape sand. Use the stick tool to etch designs into the side of your castle. Find hidden items like pearls or sea shells to accessorize your sandcastles. The second mode allows you to select a semitransparent blueprint to construct your castle. This mode unlocks hidden objects for your treasure chest in addition to more castle blueprints. The final mode, Crab Battle, is a tower defense type game where crabs will attack your castle in waves. You must fortify your defenses with cannons and fend off the ever menacing crabs to protect your prized castle heart.</p>",

Players point the Wii Remote to aim, B button to shoot and wiggle the remote to reload. The two main buttons are used to change weapons, and other actions such as throwing a grenade.</p>\n<p>The game is set before the events of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1218/the-house-of-the-dead/\">first episode</a> and it takes place in the town of Bayou City. The well-known Agent G of the series is on his first mission this time, and he teams up with the Detective Washington to fight the plague of mutants, and who they thought to be at the head of this mess: Papa Caesar.</p>\n<p>The game, while still faithful to the spirit of the series, adopts very different tone, with the use of a vintage effect, popularised in the grindhouse movie direction. That way, the game goes over the top in different areas: violence, taunts, the scenario, all deliberately hinting at playing a B-game.</p>\n<p>There are three main modes are available: Story Mode, Director's Cut Mode and Mini-Games. Story Mode contains the classic rail-shooter concept, divided in nine levels. Director's Cut features the same levels but enhanced and generally longer. Mini-games are mostly shoot challenges for multiple players. By playing well or unlocking some achievements, the player wins money, which can be spent on upgrading weapons or buying new ones.</p>\n<p>The game still supports multiplayer for two players simultaneously. As a novelty, a player can carry up two different weapons.</p>",

All the environments, objects and characters are rendered in black and white, as if drawn in a comic book. The only other colour present is red, which accounts for the gallons of blood flowing from the victims of Jack, the game's protagonist. Aside from being inspired by comic books, MadWorld's presentation is also taking hints from the competitive TV shows, with two over-enthusiastic hosts commenting every event happening in the game. </p>\n<p>The core of the MadWorld experience is a series of challenges, player must take part in. Each challenge presents a confined arena, in which player should score points by defeating his enemies in the most elaborate way possible and take part in the so-called Bloodbath-Challenges, which present additional rules and timed mini-games (like ManDarts or ManGolf) for racking up the points. Once a sufficient amount of points was met, players must fight a unique boss enemy for the current challenge. When boss is defeated, the player will be free to proceed to the next challenge. </p>\n<p>The game also features a heavy use of quick time events in conjuncture with Wii motion-sensitive controls for the finishing moves, mini-games and general tasks, such as avoiding being hit by the enemy.</p>",

Ashley, the main character, had finally met her father. But even now, he seems more interested in his work than in his daughter. He hardly come back to home during week-ends, letting his sister, Jessica, take care of Ashley.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, Ashley receives a message from her father. He is asking her to come to the Juliet Lake in order to spend some time together and to camp there. But as Ashley arrives at Juliet Lake, the reality seems different: someone steals her bag, and she has the feeling that she has already come here, a long time ago...</p>\n<p>While the game is in 3D, it is mostly played on a 2D level during moves, and when investigating a place, the camera is on Ashley's shoulders. The game focuses on puzzles, which uses the Wiimote and mostly dialog. Since you are leading an investigation, you have the possibility to photograph any element you wish in order to help you later or use as a proof. But the game is linear, which means that all these actions has to be done in a correct (and most of the time obvious) order.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Tetris Party is a WiiWare edition of the traditional game of Tetris in a variety of modes, and it also introduces new modes such as Co-op Tetris and Duel Spaces. The standard tetris mode has a ghost shape at the bottom of the screen so you can see where the block will land, you can see the next four blocks and you can hold a block for later use.</p>\n<p>In single player you can choose Marathon, Computer Battle, Field Climber, Shadow and Stage Racer.</p>\n<p>Marathon is an endless game where you have to get as many lines as possible. Computer Battle is the same except against a computer opponent. Field Climber is a Lemmings-like, similar to the gameplay in Tetris Plus. A tiny person walks at the bottom of the screen, you have to help him climb all the way to the top by laying out blocks to form stairs, but be careful not to squash him. Shadow is a game where you have to fill in a shadow figure with blocks. You have to try to make a perfect overlap with no blocks outside the silhouette. In Stage Racer you have to manoeuvre a single block down a vertically scrolling screen. Move and rotate it so that it doesn't get stuck, because when it touches the top of the screen it's game over.</p>\n<p>Multiplayer offers the following games: VS Battle, VS Field Climber, VS Hot Lines, VS Shadow, Co-op Tetris and Duel Spaces.</p>\n<p>VS Battle, VS Field Climber, VS Hot Lines and VS Shadow are all battle versions of the single player games. You can gain power-ups that temporary freezes the opponents game or temporary stops them from rotating their blocks. In VS Hot Lines you have to clear certain lines indicated in green, which are typically not at the bottom of the screen. Once you clear a green line it disappears, clear all green lines to win the game. Co-op Tetris and Duel Spaces are both played in a larger area, 20 blocks wide. In Co-op Tetris two players work together to form lines. In Duel Spaces two players take turns dropping tetrominoes. Each player must try to seal off sections in the grid and capture as grid space as possible.</p>\n<p>You can also play online in World Battle or Friend Battle using Wi-Fi, and you can play using the Wii Balance Board.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Explore the Wuhu Islands with <em>Wii Sports Resort</em>, the sequel to the Wii launch title, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=4902370515589\">Wii Sports</a>. <em>Wii Sports Resort</em> includes and takes advantage of a peripheral called Wii MotionPlus, which enhances the player's motion control in the assorted sports. Available in this game are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Swordplay:</strong> Defeat your opponent in two out of three rounds. Alternate between attacking and defending with your sword.</li>\n<li><strong>Wakeboarding:</strong> Hold the Wii Remote like a handle, and use it to turn from side to side. Lift it to perform acrobatic jumps.</li>\n<li><strong>Frisbee:</strong> Hold and flick the Wii Remote like a Frisbee.</li>\n<li><strong>Archery:</strong> Hold the Wii Remote like a bow. Pull the Nunchuk like the string, and release Z to fire.</li>\n<li><strong>Basketball:</strong> Lift and throw the Wii Remote overhead to throw the ball into the hoop.</li>\n<li><strong>Table Tennis:</strong> Swing the Wii Remote like a racket to hit the ball.</li>\n<li><strong>Golf:</strong> Hold the Wii Remote downward and swing it like a golf club to hit the ball.</li>\n<li><strong>Bowling:</strong> Swing the Wii Remote as though you're bowling a bowling ball. Adjust spin and angle using the Control Pad.</li>\n<li><strong>Power Cruising:</strong> Hold the Wii Remote and Nunchuk as though they were bike handlebars. Tilt to steer, and use B to accelerate.</li>\n<li><strong>Canoeing:</strong> Move the Wii Remote from front to back as though you were rowing with a canoe paddle.</li>\n<li><strong>Cycling:</strong> Alternate the Wii Remote and the Nunchuk up and down as though cycling.</li>\n<li><strong>Air Sports:</strong> Tilt the Wii Remote to move your body in the air as though skydiving, or hold it like a paper plane when using a plane.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As with the original, <em>Wii Sport Resort</em> uses Miis throughout the game, both as spectators and player characters. In addition to this, characters can also be imported from the Mii Contest Channel to appear in your copy of the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Overlord: Dark Legend</em> is a prequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Overlord\">Overlord</a> redesigned for the Wii.</p>\n<p>You control young Lord Gromgard, who is reclaiming his father's duchy where elves, dwarfs and bandits have eroded his power and the peasants no longer fear him. To make things worse, his older brother and sister are planning to usurp his father. On his sixteenth birthday, he is given a suit of armor that belonged to his uncle, the Black Baron, which allows him to take his place as the Overlord.</p>\n<p>As in the other Overlord games, you'll do fairly little of your own fighting. Most of the game is played through manipulating your minions. You direct your minions with the Wiimote and move the overlord himself with the Nunchuck. There are four types of minions: You start with browns, who are good melee fighters. As you progress, you gain reds, who are are immune to fire and can attack from a distance with fireballs, blues, who are healers and can swim and greens, who can turn invisible and clear poison.</p>\n<p>Minions are summoned by spending life force, which you gain from fallen enemies. Unlike other games in the series, this is not color specific. Gromgard can make his minions attack a specific target, which could be an enemy or an object. Minions collect weapons and armor from enemies and things they smash and use them to improve their abilities. He can also throttle a minion, which causes them to explode. Different minions do different kinds of damage. He can quick-kill them for a boost of mana or health, depending on minion type, or make them sacrifice themselves in a blood or mana pit for a larger boost of mana or health. Mana and health can also be refilled more traditionally by picking up items or having the minions do it. He can control where the minions go by placing waypoints. All active minions will stay there until told to move.</p>\n<p>Game progression is represented by a map. Each section of the map has its own sub-map. This map shows the location of the minion summoning sites, mana pits, blood pits and teleportation sites. The Overlord can teleport to any site he has previously visited. Generally speaking, each sub-section of the map is a level and many of them end in boss fights. Progression is controlled by barriers that require a certain number of minions or a certain type of minions to pass or require you to have found some item, like a missing spoke for a wheel you must turn.</p>\n<p>As you progress through the game, you will find items that minion relics, health relics, mana relics, forges, spell relics and hives. Minion relics increase the maximum number of minions you can summon. Health or mana relics increase the size of your health or mana bar. Forges gives you the ability to buy new weapons and armor and level-up your minions with the gold you've collected from enemies and side-quests. Spell relics gives you new spells and hives give you access to new types of minions. All of these require four minions to pick them up. They will then walk to the nearest teleporter to send it back to your castle and you must protect them or their way their.</p>\n<p>Spells can be direct offensive attacks, boosts to your minions abilities or handicaps to enemies. Casting them drains mana.</p>",

        "description": "<p>NewU Fitness First Personal Trainer is a fitness game for the Wii compatible with the Wii Balance Board. It features both structured exercise programs and nutrition programs.</p>\n<p>Unlike other fitness products for the Wii it uses real trainers and real video rather than animated characters. The fitness programs are designed by the Fitness First gym chain, the nutrition programs are in association with the You Are What You Eat television series.</p>\n<p>The game features a choice of four Fitness First personal trainers, two female and two male. When you create a profile in the game you select a primary goal and a secondary one from a choice of 25. These include things such as \"Detox\", \"Lower Body\" and \"Busy Parent\", there are also more sports related goals such as \"Ski Fit\" and \"Tennis Fit\". While setting up the profile you are also asked many more personal questions such as exercise level, dietary preferences and so on so that the game can tailor it's programs to you.</p>\n<p>The fitness programs are selected from a set of 80+ exercises tailored to your preferences. Unlike other games however you are expected to follow the program, there isn't choice in this other than opting for \"Express\" versions of the workouts if you're pressed for time. In this respect the game is more like having a strict personal trainer than other games. The workouts start fairly easily but the game monitors your progress through the Wii controllers and as you proceed they get steadily harder and harder to match how well you're doing. There is also a challenge mode where you can attempt prolonged challenges such as \"Dance\" and \"Army\".</p>\n<p>The Nutrition Section is also controlled from your preferences. You can select what foods you do and don\u2019t eat such as meat, fish, dairy, gluten and nuts. Then for each day you will be given meal suggestions for 5 meals a day, two choices for each meal. When you select a meal you will be taken to the recipe sheet, including pictures, preparation instructions and health tips. The game will even generate an entire weeks shopping list for you if you want.</p>\n<p>An exercise program lasts from 20 mins to 45 mins depending on how advanced you are. A program consists of a set of exercises that you are shown before you start the workout.  The exercises themselves are presented using real video footage of the trainer doing the exercise from a number of camera angles; a bit like an exercise DVD but with interactive feedback from the Wiimote and Balance Board. The exercises are fairly strict about you doing them correctly unlike other exercise games. You will lose points for not keeping up,  not using your arms correctly or having bad posture.</p>\n<p>The game works with either Wiimote plus Balance Board or just Wiimote.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dead Rising: Chop Till you Drop</em> is an adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dead+Rising\">Dead Rising</a>, for the Wii. The freelance photojournalist Frank West investigates a zombie outbreak in Willamette, Colorado. He has three days at the mall to rescue survivors and solve the case before the helicopter that dropped him off returns.</p>\n<p>The basic outlines are maintained from the Xbox 360 game, but numerous changes have been made to fit the game into the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Resident+Evil+4\">Resident Evil 4</a> engine and to accommodate the Wii's graphical capabilities and very different controller. The plot is the same and Frank saves the same people, though a few are missing. The map of the mall is almost the same, but Frank can no longer jump and it adds new barriers and eliminates some shortcuts, which changes navigation. While the game is still primarily about killing crowds of zombies, there are fewer of them and they are more aggressive. The cut-scenes are also unchanged, though they are now pre-rendered, but the structure of the game has been overhauled. You can have multiple save slots. It is no longer a real-time affair, but a series of missions given in sequence. Otis the janitor gives Frank side missions which are timed. You are scored on these missions based on how long it takes to complete them (or whether you complete them at all), the number of zombies Frank kills and the damage he takes. High scores result in more side missions and top scores earn various items. After a batch of side missions is done, you are given the next plot mission. These are untimed and represent Franks only real opportunity to wander around the mall. He still level-ups, but the bonuses he gains are different. Health is now a solid bar rather than discrete boxes, so the bar length just increases a little with each level instead of adding a box at specified points. Frank gets bonuses to weapon durability and damage and to book capacity, which is separated from the rest of the inventory. Books are used strictly for teaching him new moves for specific weapons or for unarmed fighting.</p>\n<p>While he still can pick up and use numerous objects as weapons, from sensible choices like katanas and bats to silly ones like cash registers and shower heads to things that are more transports than weapons, like shopping carts, skateboards and bicycles, the number of usable items has been greatly reduced. Melee weapons all wear out and break with use. There are two classes. Smaller items can be pocketed, allowing Frank to fire a gun. Larger items, like rototillers and chainsaws, are dropped if he is attacked or enters gun mode. He can only have one melee weapon of each type at a time. These weapons cannot go into the inventory, which is used strictly for food and mixables and ammo-based weapons. There are multiple kinds of food which can be eaten to recover health or mixed in blenders to create shakes with various effects. Food can be found laying around the environment, recovered from dead zombies or found inside trash cans and boxes. These breakable items way also contain melee weapons. Dead zombies can also drop cash and ammunition.</p>\n<p>The camera throughout the game has been changed to an over-the-shoulder view. When you go into gun mode, the camera zooms in and you aim manually using the remote. Other limited-supply weapons such as saw blades and molotov cocktails are also used this way. The role of guns has been greatly expanded. There are now five basic kinds of guns, pistols, shotguns, machine guns, rifles and magnums. Each has its own kind of ammunition. The ammunition does not take inventory space, though the guns do. Early in the game, there is a mission that gives access to a gun shop, after which you can buy better guns, for instance, replacing the rifle with a semi-automatic rifle. This is also where you buy increased ammunition capacity and books.</p>\n<p>As before, missions are mixed between fighting bosses, which the game calls psychopaths and rescuing survivors (or frequently rescuing a survivor from a boss). Frank is now limited to escorting three survivors at a time and must do the survivor missions one at a time. Most of the boss fights are essentially the same, where he fights a powerful human enemy. Some of the bosses have had their story segments eliminated and are present as super-zombies. These super-zombies are visually distinct, have special attacks and drop bonuses when killed. Another boss fight has been converted to a QTE, where you must press buttons quickly when prompted. The game also adds new animal zombies, which are grenade-dropping parrots and very fast poodles.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Shaun White Snowboarding World Stage</em> is Ubisoft's second game in the Shaun White Snowboarding series. This time it is exclusively released on the Wii.</p>\n<p>As with the Wii version of the previous game, it once again makes full use of the Wii Balance Board. Shaun White World Stage is also one of the first games to use the Wii Motion Plus. With it, the controls are more precise when riding down the slopes. Another feature is that with the Wii Motion Plus, the player can access a trick editing mode where he can create his own tricks. The Wiimote is moved as if it was the snowboard and its movements are mimicked by the rider. These tricks can then be used on the slopes by activating the one shot tricks.</p>\n<p>This year, the goal of the game is to reach the world stage. To do so, the player must climb up the world ranking. The player's crew starts at a world ranking of 100 and must reach the 10th position to get access to the world stage. The world stage is composed of many events and the player gains points in each of them. The ultimate goal is to be the best in the world by winning the world stage.</p>\n<p>All the riders from the first game return, and 4 new riders have been added for a total of 13 riders, including Shaun White. As with last year's title, before riding down a slope, the player chooses a rider and a cameraman. The cameramen chosen from the riders has a special ability that can be used while riding.</p>\n<p>There are some other new features since the last instalment of the game such as leaderboards, achievements, rider customization, difficulty settings and new events. Each slope has a leaderboard for the time and tricks score, separated into Wii Balance Board and Wiimote results. There are over 180 achievements. Riders can be customized by changing their clothes and board. New gear is awarded after completing events. The player can also change the game difficulty between normal and hard. The hard mode is very challenging and is an option mainly for players who played the first game. There are several new events like knockout race, overtake racing, checkpoint time attack, checkpoint trick attack, air trick attack, rail trick attack, big air, slope style and free ride.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Spore Hero</em> is the first appearance of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Spore\">Spore</a> franchise on the Nintendo Wii platform. This title merges both simulation and RPG elements. By collecting blue meteor shards scattered across the environment and then using those shards as currency within an adaptation of Spore\u2019s original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/34664/spore-creature-creator/\">Creature Creator</a>, players can customize and enhance their creatures using all of the body parts found in the core game and the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/44395/spore-creepy-cute-parts-pack/\">Creepy and Cute</a> expansion pack.</p>\n<p>The main gameplay is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/36674/spore-creatures/\">Spore Creatures</a> where the player controls a single creature, landed on an alien planet along with its nemesis. The creature has to help the native inhabitants who are poisoned by the red rocks brought along by the nemesis. This is done by collecting shards. Taking on quests assigned by NPCs allows the player to advance the game's good-versus-evil storyline. Quests include both singing and dancing mini-games. The game also incorporates an arena fighting mechanic that takes place both in-game and in a dedicated multiplayer mode, based on attacking, blocking and counter attacking that requires precise timing.</p>\n<p>Most of the game is played out as an exploration platformer, where certain areas can only be accessed after the required abilities have been secured, such as a double jump or flying.</p>",

Minon can become as tall as a skyscraper or as tiny as an ant, depending on the situation required. Make people happy by retrieving balloons, preventing bored fans from leaving a concert, and demolishing cities to help a father find his apartment. It's all in a day's work for Minon!</p>\n<p><em>Domino Rally</em> is an action game where you control a superhero, Minon, by placing dominoes in front of him, which he uses to hop onto to get where he needs to go. Minon can use the dominoes to reach distant areas and interact with characters, but he must complete his goal before he runs out of both time and \"Minonade\" (the source of his powers that lets him drop dominoes). While there are some vague similarities to the PlayStation game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/25101/no-one-can-stop-mr-domino/\">No One Can Stop Mr. Domino</a>, there really are more differences than similarities - the main one being that Minon places dominoes in front of him, while Mr. Domino drops them behind him and hits the first one at the end of a level.</p>\n<p>Minon cannot reverse, which is a key reason why he needs the dominos in front of him. Players aim where they want the next set of dominoes to be placed using the Wii Remote and then drop them with the B Button. The A Button makes Minon stop. Sometimes, Minon may start to lose his balance - if this occurs, the player needs to tilt the Wii Remote forward and back until he's stable once more.</p>",

Alex must travel to the center of the Earth to restore S.O.P.H.I.A.'s missing upgrades, and fight the various mutants and bosses to proceed to new areas.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is similar to the original game.  Vehicle \"Overworld\" exploration levels are set as a 2D side-scroller that opens up the 8 different world areas more (similar to other titles as the modern Castlevania and Metroid games) once the player collects the necessary upgrades.  </p>\n<p>Alex may also leave the vehicle to go on foot in order to explore the various caves and fight bosses in a 3/4 overhead perspective.</p>",

In addition to being able to play these classic arcade games, new features have been included in this Wii compilation. Users can complete 75 goals to unlock arcade bezels, marquees, character artwork, and a special mode with alternative DIP switch settings for each game. Players can also link their high scores with the Mii characters. The collection allows users to save or load their progress in each of the games at any time. There is support for two players and also for cooperative games.</p>\n<p>Each game supports the four main Nintendo Wii controller options including the Wii Remote by itself, Wii Remote with Nunchuk, the Classic Controller, and the GameCube Controller. Players can also customize their button assignments. Since the arcade version of <em>Heavy Barrel</em> supports two rotary analog joysticks, special support was included for the controls. When playing <em>Heavy Barrel</em> with the Wii Remote by itself, aiming and moving are automatically synchronized to the same direction. Players can independently aiming and move in different directions using the Wii Remote + Nunchuk, Classic Controller, and GameCube Controller.</p>",

Trek across the world with R&amp;R Diving Service to exotic locales, including Pacific reefs, a South American river, sunken, shark-infested shipwrecks, the icy Antarctic and even in the inky black depths well below the Red Sea.</p>\n<p><em>Endless Ocean: Blue World</em> is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/31290/endless-ocean/\">Endless Ocean</a>, however, no experience with the previous game is necessary to play. You play as a diver looking for the Song of Dragons, and being recruited by R&amp;R Diving Service, whose home base is on the small Nineball Island. Diving is very simple to control - simply point the Wii Remote at the screen and hold the B Trigger to swim. By aiming the pointer near the top, bottom, left or right of the screen, you'll change direction. The A Button is used to interact with fish, coral reefs, pick up objects and more. You can also use other tools such as fish food, a whistle, a multi-sensor (for salvaging items) and a camera.</p>\n<p>The game features a main story to follow, but players can take it at their own pace, or decide to try some of the side-missions, such as dolphin training, filling an aquarium with fish to display, managing your private reef, mapping out areas you've visited and selling the maps for profit, salvaging treasure, pursuing special requests and treasure rumours, taking on photo requests for magazines, and even taking guided tours around locations you've already visited. Completing certain milestones in the game awards you \"titles\", which act as an achievement system. You can give yourself any title that you've unlocked to use as an identifier, and even mix and match them.</p>\n<p><em>Endless Ocean: Blue World</em> supports 2 player simultaneous multiplayer. Two divers can explore the ocean together, and send text messages to each other to communicate. If players have Wii Speak, they can talk to each other while diving as well. During online dives, main story quests cannot be completed and new creatures that you discover will not be recorded in your encyclopedia.</p>",

However, the game centers on monumental fights against boss-sized enemies.</p>\n<p>It is a sequel in the established Monster Hunter series. It is the first entry of the series to feature underwater combat. It also comes with a comprehensive multi-player part that works without the Wii's Friend Code system. The multi-player mode allows up to 4 players to team up against the monsters. Communication occurs via Wii Speak or a USB Keyboard.</p>",

It is a downloadable WiiWare-exclusive title, and considered the fourth title in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/8458/crush-pinball-series/\">Crush Pinball series</a>.</p>\n<p>It contains three tables or stages with 3-D polygonal graphics and online leaderboards. The ability to \"tilt\" the table remains, and is accomplished through motion control. Operating the paddles is done with simple button presses on the Wii Remote or Nunchuck.</p>\n<p>The game features Action Balls, which are special abilities that can be applied to the ball during gameplay. For instance, one action will add brief extra speed to the ball that allows it to bounce and rebound further, and crash through some obstacles off which the ball would normally just bounce. The actions must be earned, and there is a draw-down time between uses, as multiple uses may be saved up. <em>Alien Crush Returns</em> also saves high scores for one player, and features a story mode about a struggle between aliens and space marines, and occasional boss battles.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Fragile Dreams</em> takes place after an apocalyptic event that wiped out most of mankind. Young Seto finds a note from his deceased grandfather urging him to travel to the red tower that lights up the night sky. Along the way he finds a young, silver haired girl Ren who drives him to journey through the ruined world in search of companionship.</p>\n<p><em>Fragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of the Moon</em> is an action-adventure game with light RPG elements and a focus on exploring the often desolate surroundings. Players are tasked with navigating the empty environments while fighting ghosts and obtaining items such as sketches and short stories that reveal the last moments of the lives of those lost in the great catastrophe. Seto is guided through a third-person perspective and the flashlight is one of his most important aids. Controlled through the Wii Remote it illuminates dark surroundings to interact with the environment and is needed to solve many puzzles. It can also uncover hidden enemies and often a sound through the mini speaker provides a hint about their location.</p>\n<p>The Nunchuck is used to walk, sneak around, and crouch. It is possible to go into a first-person perspective to get a better view of the environment. Additional weapons that can be picked up during the course of the game are sticks, an iron pipe, a bow, a hammer, a bamboo sword, and a katana.</p>",

His alter ego, Nick, decides to head for mythical Mimin Island, a place rumored to be able to make anyone's dream come true! While on a raft sailing to the island, he sees something drowning in the water! He quickly transforms into Captain\u2605Rainbow and attempts to rescue it...but he fails, and loses his vital transformation belt. He wakes up on the beach of Mimin Island with a strange bracelet on, and without his belt. What will Nick do now? Will his dream ever come true?</p>\n<p><em>Captain\u2605Rainbow</em> is an adventure game based around happiness. As Nick, your initial goal is to grant your own wish of becoming popular again, and getting off Mimin Island. However, as you explore the island, you discover that it has other inhabitants - minor characters from long forgotten Nintendo games, such as Birdo from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=074299061196\">Super Mario Bros. 2</a>, Little Mac from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=045496630287\">Punch-Out!!</a>, Crazy Tracy from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=045496730291\">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</a>, Lip from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=4902370502350\">Panel de Pon</a>, and more. These characters all have their own dreams and unfulfilled wishes, and you're able to grant them instead. However, it's often better to get to know them before you grant their wishes, as this opens up new quests relating to other characters and lets you help them out even further.</p>\n<p>The game plays mostly like an adventure game with some action elements. You talk to characters, examine objects and pick up inventory to use with different characters and objects. Nick can also charge a \"dash\" to ram into objects, allowing him to knock things down or break things. When he transforms into Captain\u2605Rainbow, his dash becomes more powerful and he can use his trademark Yo-Yo to attack.</p>",

During the course of the campaign he has to win one-on-one lightsaber battles against enemies like Count Doku.</p>\n<p>The controls are designed for the unique Wii controls which means the player needs to swing his Wii remote with the correct timing and the game converts it into in-game fighting moves. If the player performs certain hit combos which are different for every character the force meter fills up which can be used to hit the enemy with powerful force attacks. From time to time there is a quicktime event if the two sabers are in content: then the players have to perform given attacks.</p>\n<p>Besides the campaign there is also a battle mode (randomly selected opponents and areas) and a challenge mode where the player has to win under certain conditions. All these three modes unlock additional characters (overall ten), areas and costumes which can be used in the multiplayer mode.</p>",

In comparison the other versions this game is much more focused on a fast arcade gameplay - that's why both the Dynasty and the Be-a-Pro mode are missing. Here the player can only choose between a whole season, the play-offs or the FIBA World Championship. </p>\n<p>The controls are adjusted to the special Wii movement controls which allow a more direct control over the players. It also features one special playing mode: All-Play. In this mode the player only controls the passes (by choosing the next player with the Remote), the dunks (by imitating the throwing movement) and snatching away the ball in the defensive (by shaking the controller) - everything else is controlled by the AI.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Case Closed: The Mirapolis Investigation</em> is based on the ongoing manga <em>Detective Conan</em> by G\u014dsh\u014d Aoyama, serialized in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday since 1994, and the following TV series adaptation with the same name. The series was partially licensed to North America under the name <em>Case Closed</em>, hence the different game title used outside Japan. The franchise is centered around high school detective Shinichi Kud\u014d (or Jimmy Kudo in <em>Case Closed</em>) who after being drugged by a mysterious organization transforms into a shrunken version of himself, alias Conan Edogawa. After this event, he continues to solve various cases together with detective M\u014dri (Moore).</p>\n<p><em>The Mirapolis Investigation</em> is an original story and begins as detective Richard Moore (Kogor\u014d M\u014dri) is invited to the opening ceremony of an amusement park called Mirapolis, with the owner's intention of promoting it using his popularity, as is often the case in the anime series. Together with him arrive Rachel (Ran), his daughter, Conan and The Junior Detective League, Conan's friends from the elementary school. Soon after the opening the first murder takes place and Conan must once again find the culprit.</p>\n<p>The player controls Conan from a third-person perspective as he explores the Mirapolis facilities: the Hotel, the Annex, the Gym and the Courtyard. To solve the crimes, he needs to collect information from various characters, and sometimes analyze the physical evidence in a point-and-click fashion. The most challenging gameplay feature is the clue link, which is as the name implies, a chain of hints that you must correctly choose from your notebook. Every correct clue that you placed gives you 1 Link Point, but if you make only one mistake, all of your Link Points are lost. Various bonus material can be earned if you collect a specific number of Link Points or by playing the mini games included. Depending on your score in those mini games you get a number of points, which you can then use to acquire bonus content.</p>",

These three robots are humanity's last hope!</p>\n<p>The game is a retooled port of of the 2003 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=ExZeus\">ExZeus</a>, originally created for the arcades for the Sega NAOMI and Tsunami Tsumo.</p>\n<p>The game is an on-rails arcade shooter in a third-person perspective. You can tilt your Nunchuck up, down, left or right to move in all directions while progressing forward, shooting enemies and collecting power-ups and gold (which act as money you can use to buy items at a shop every time you beat a boss). You have the ability to lock-on enemies and fire powerful missiles at them, and you also have a laser (which recharges by itself after every use) you can launch by holding down the shoot button. You can also send out nuclear bombs on the area, which can clear all the enemies on-screen, and can also help in bosses.</p>\n<p>At the end of every level, you face a boss. Before a boss begins, a screen will show up telling you the weak-points of said boss. Successfully defeating a boss will take you to the item shop, where you can buy items to power up your robot, and then you will proceed to the next level.</p>\n<p>The major difference between ExZeus and Counter Force is that you are able to freely point and shoot enemies with the Wii Remote with the help of an additional yellow lock-on mechanic - when aiming your Wii Remote-controlled crosshair cursor onto a specific enemy, it will lock on to the enemy without depleting anything and when the shoot button is pressed will aim the bullet at the targeted enemy. The original red/blue crosshair from ExZeus remains, however, for the use of firing the laser. Everything else (lock-on missiles, bombs) is remotely unchanged. There is also a two player mode (one player holds the Nunchuck, while the other holds the Wii Remote - can be changed in-game by pressing the minus button) which somewhat uses the original ExZeus control scheme - the red/blue crosshair is also used to fire additional bullets from the player holding the Nunchuck which function in the same way as in the original game.</p>",

The player controls one team of three characters. He runs, passes the ball, fights, kicks, and punches characters of the opposing team, steals the ball from them, and performs dunks in order to win the match. These actions are performed with a Wii Remote and a Nunchuk controller. During a match so called Mystery Boxes will appear randomly on the court. Running over them will pick them up and reveal one of eight available power-ups that influence game play and enable players to protect their team or their basket with a shield, increase energy, or drain points from the opponents score.</p>\n<p>The basketball courts are set in outdoor locations, such as a jungle, the inside of a volcano, a tropical island, a Greek village, a desert, and a dark forest. Each court has a two point, three point and a four point scoring zone, the further away from the opponents basket, the higher the points are when scoring a basket from distance. There are several teams the player can pick from, such as a Goth team, Samba Girls, Archaeologists, a Wild Western team, a group of Mercenaries, or Alien Robots. </p>\n<p>HoopWorld can be played alone against the CPU, or together with a friend. There are three different game modes. The Quick Match allows a short session. In Tournament Mode the player plays through all available courts, and winning matches in Tournament Mode unlocks screens, teams and courts in Quick Match Mode. There is also a Survival Mode, which is an endless mode where the player keeps on playing until he loses. In this mode the AI gets increasingly more difficult. Once the player loses in this mode, his scores from all matches played in this session are accumulated, and the player can choose to upload this score to an online leader board. Next to three different game modes, there are four difficulty levels, that players can choose from. Those range from easy to crazy.</p>",

When two of the pirates on board the Thousand Sunny ship confess to eating all food, the pirates decided to restock at nearby islands. When they accidentally stumble upon a magical island they loose their ship and the taste for hidden treasure rises.</p>\n<p>The player takes on the role of of the eight pirates and can switch between characters at will. The pirates can attack enemies and plant life. Enemies drop iron and gunpowder, while plant life drops leaves, spices, wood and fruit. All these resources can be used to craft special tools such as a pick axe, fishing rod and butterfly net. These tools can in turn be used to find new resources.</p>\n<p>The pirates have to fulfill various quests, for each quest certain resources are required, so it's up to the player to explore the world and find these resources. Often, combining resources will help the pirates to unlock new areas of the world. They can for example combine wood with liana to build a bridge. Food can be eaten to improve the characteristics of the pirates.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Wherever there's crime, there's Batman. And it's a good thing too, because with all the supervillains with their devilish schemes, Gotham is going to need all the help it can get! Luckily, Batman's not on his own - he'll get help from his friends like Green Arrow, Robin, Hawkman, Blue Beetle, Captain Marvel, Plastic Man, Booster Gold and more! Whether it's the Gotham Musuem or outer space, you can count on Batman to fight for justice and put the crooks behind bars!</p>\n<p><em>Batman: The Brave and The Bold - The Videogame</em> is a sidescrolling platformer beat-'em-up based on the cartoon series of the same name. Players control Batman and a tag-along superhero partner (which differs from episode to episode) and fight various villains as they save Gotham City and beyond. Enemies drop coins which can be used to upgrade gadgets, as well as purchase new ones. If a player loses all their health, they loose 100 coins and are respawned back into the game to continue the crimefighting. Each player has a special Jump-in Hero they can select, who can help them with a powerful attack every so often (similar to using magic in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/199/golden-axe/\">Golden Axe</a>).</p>\n<p>The game is not limited to two players, however. If you have a Nintendo DS and the DS version of <em>The Brave and The Bold</em>, you can link the DS up to the Wii, allowing a third player to play as the Batman-obsessed, magical tagalong, Bat-Mite. Bat-Mite controls differently from other characters. He can fly around the screen anywhere, and can assist the heroes by conjuring health or energy pickups, or try to help fight by dropping anvils and bombs out of nowhere. However, just like in the show, Bat-Mite can be a nuisance to the heroes too - his attacks will damage other players if they don't avoid them!</p>",

The interesting thing about Bit Boy!! is the ability to play in different generations (8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, etc.) As you progress through the generations, more additions will be added to the gameplay, such as the ability to attack and jump. There are four game modes, \"Classic\", \"Warp\", \"Turbo Classic\", and \"Turbo Warp\". Classic is the standard game mode. Saving all of your friends and wiping out all the monsters is the main goal of this mode. The goal of Warp Mode is to collect as many Time Diamonds as possible, however, if you get hit by a enemy, you will be warped to the next level. Turbo Classic is the same as Classic mode, with the addition of super speed, huge amount of attacks, and unlimited lives. Turbo Warp is the same Warp, with the addition of super speed.</p>",

A vertical column on the screen shows each players total score and their performance on the current movement, bad, OK, or great. Scoring several 'greats' in a row triggers the awarding of bonus 'combo' points. \nThe tracks can be played in any order and there are no 'secret' tracks to unlock.</p>\n<p>There are two modes of play:* Quick Play  </p>\n<p>Simply pick up the Wii remote, start the game, select a track and start dancing. Points are gained for performing the moves correctly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Challenge  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>In each challenge one player chooses the number of rounds in the challenge and then either picks a track or has the game select one at random. There are three challenges all of which are best suited for multiplayer mode, these are :\n    + Regular: in which the players follow the on-screen moves and just dance along. The players each gain points - as in Quick Play, and the player with the highest score wins the challenge.\n    + Strike a Pose: this is similar to the old party game of 'Statues'. all players dance along top the music but must stop dancing and remain perfectly still while an on-screen counter freezes. Dancing recommences when the counter starts. Players moving when they are not supposed to lose points.\n    + Last One Standing: each player has seven lives. In this challenge the players follow the on-screen dance moves and a life is lost for every wrong move that is made. Players are eliminated when all lives have been lost until only one remains.</p>\n<p>There is also a Warm Up option to prepare the player(s) for their dance session, and an Extras option which gives the player(s) access to game statistics, overall progress details for each song, a tutorial, and the game credits.</p>",

Would it even be possible to escape again?</p>\n<p><em>Calling</em> is a horror game centered around several individuals who find themselves trapped in a ghostly otherworld. Each protagonist can search their environment for notes and clues to the mystery, but they won't find any weapons to arm themselves with.

Inside the Mnemonic Abyss a telephone can connect two places just like a doorway, instantly transporting someone between locations just by dialing the number.

        "description": "<p><em>Bleach: Shattered Blade</em> is a game based on the <em>Bleach</em> manga and anime series. It is the second game in the Bleach franchise to be released on a Nintendo home console, the first being a GameCube game released exclusively in Japan.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong>  </p>\n<p>Ichigo Kurosaki is a teenager with the ability to see ghosts and spirits. His life changes drastically when, during an encounter with Rukia, an injured Soul Reaper, Ichigo absorbs all her energy and transforms into a Soul Reaper himself. Armed with a Zanpaku-to sword, Ichigo now has to fulfil her role as a Soul Reaper while she heals.\nThis part of the back story is important as the game's story starts with Ichigo and his friends in the Soul World after rescuing Rukia, where he must collect shards of the ancient Sokyoku blade to open a sealed gate back and return to his world.</p>\n<p><strong>The Game</strong>  </p>\n<p>The game features three distinct modes of play: Arcade, Versus, and Episode. A tutorial and an in-game shop where items can be bought are also available. Players earn kan or money as they complete sections in the Arcade and Episode modes.* Episode mode: \nThe game has eight episodes, three of which are immediately available and five others which can be unlocked as the player progresses. Each episode tells the same story using a different character and begins by showing a sequence of still pictures to set the scene for each character and explain why they must have the shards, then the player enters a series of one-round fights.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Arcade Mode: \nThe player must battle through eight rounds against a random opponent in order to win.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Versus mode: \nThe player chooses a character and plays against the computer or another player.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Combat</strong>  </p>\n<p>Combat is all about sword play with the Wii remote acting as the sword while the Nunchuk Control Stick is used to move the character around the battle area and block opponents blows.\nIn addition to the regular attacks, each character has a special attack, a critical attack and a Bankai mode.  </p>\n<p>Special attacks are triggered by holding the B button on the Wii remote and making specific movements, for example to have Orihime heal herself or Hitsugaya swing his sword upwards to release ice from the ground and trap his enemies.  </p>\n<p>Critical attacks are triggered by holding the A button on the Wii remote. They block incoming strikes and are as fast as regular attacks. The only defense against them is another critical attack or the Bankai mode. Either of these takes the players into <em>rochambeau</em>, a kind of rock-paper-scissors contest to decide which player hits who.  </p>\n<p>As players land successful strikes and combos, they gain spiritual energy, and when enough energy has been accumulated, Bankai mode, the ability to deliver much more powerful strikes, becomes available.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Samurai Warriors 3</em> marks the third title in the main series (not counting <em>Samurai Warriors: Katana</em>) and the first published by Nintendo, thus making the title an exclusive to the Wii.</p>\n<p><em>Samurai Warriors 3</em> puts players in control of a historical Japanese figure during Japan's Sengoku, or \"Warring States,\" period. Several characters are selectable, and once selected, the player runs through the fairly typical <em>Samurai Warriors</em> formula. Essentially, players drop into levels and cut through massive swaths of enemies working towards a boss, or \"Hero,\" character. Aside from the general hack-n-slash gameplay, players can also level-up characters, and unlock new armor and weapons.</p>\n<p>There are several game modes in the game, but they mostly cover two main styles: Players either traverse the game world following a story of Japanese unification, or plow through a different story to help a lost Samurai escape from a haunted house and demons. This latter mode is the Murasame Castle mode, and is intended to be based on <em>The Mysterious Murasame Castle</em>, which was an old Famicom Disk system title. Completed levels can be played at any time on their own. </p>\n<p>There are over 35 playable characters and the vast majority of returning characters have new models. There are seven characters new to the series. Each character has different styles, skills, and motives where the story is concerned. Motives such as family, honor, or Japanese unification drive individual characters.</p>\n<p>The game is playable with the Wii Remote and Nunchuck, the Classic Controller (or the Pro), or a GameCube controller.</p>",

Machineguns: Rage of the Machines</a>, which ran on Sega's Model 2 and Model 3 arcade hardware respectively. Both titles share a similar premise: android terrorists attack a peaceful state of America (New York and California respectively) in the near future, and it's up to a counter-terrorist squadron force to neutralize the hostiles and free the state(s) by air via a gunship.</p>\n<p><em>Gunblade NY</em> and <em>L.A. Machineguns</em> also share similar gameplay: both games are on-rails shooters which have you fly around specific loci of the areas you traverse in, gunning down enemy androids with infinite ammo. Enemy A.I. can also be completely aggressive and evasive depending on the difficulty setting the games are set to. However, what differentiates <em>L.A. Machineguns</em> from <em>Gunblade NY</em> in terms of gameplay is it's addition of complex features such as a new chain combo system, civilians (which you must avoid shooting at), and a significantly more linear pace than <em>Gunblade NY</em>'s.</p>\n<p>This port includes additional features such as new unlockable weapons and online leaderboards. Also supports the Wii Zapper.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This version of <em>GoldenEye 007</em> takes the concept behind the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3528/goldeneye-007/\"> N64 exclusive</a> and moves not only the gameplay forward to the modern era, but also fast-forwards the Bond franchise to the new guy. Pierce Brosnan's Bond will likely forever remain an N64 exclusive, as Daniel Craig's Bond takes the reigns. This <em>GoldenEye</em> isn't so much a remake or a port as it is, as Hollywood says when spinning a \"remake,\" a <em>reboot</em> of the classic title.</p>\n<p>Essentially, the game is a revamp of the <em>GoldenEye</em> story, which has James Bond fighting to stop a rogue Russian General from unleashing the powerful GoldenEye weapon. What this release brings to the table is the grittier nature of Craig's James Bond. Many story elements have been modernized as well: for instance, character motivations have been updated and Bond's tech-filled watch from the original movie and game has been replaced by a do-all cell phone. Character designs have been updated as well.</p>\n<p>This version is more in-line with its contemporary FPS titles in the dual-analog style. Like the original, it emphasizes stealth and espionage-oriented gameplay, allowing more than one way to complete missions. However, the game also contains third-person vehicular elements, such as the tank chase sequence from the film. </p>\n<p>The game retains the split-screen multiplayer mayhem the original title was known for, and again modernizes things with online gameplay for up to eight players. Like the earlier game, characters from the main game appear in multiplayer as well as classic Bond villains including infamous characters Jaws, Scaramanga (the man with the Golden Gun) and Oddjob. Overall, the game features fifty playable characters for the multiplayer experience, ten maps, three gameplay modes, and seventeen \"modifiers.\"</p>",

Where <em>Wii Play</em> included the standard Wii Remote, <em>FlingSmash</em> is intended to show off the revamped Wii Remote Plus. This is essentially the Wii Remote featuring the Wii Motion Plus technology.</p>\n<p>The game itself is a combination of pinball and table tennis; the player uses the controller to fling the ball-shaped character - Zip - into horizontally or vertically scrolling screens of blocks and items in order to smash them. Zip changes size and form in various situations, including a heavy steel ball.</p>\n<p>The story revolves around this character, who needs to defend Sutton Island from an invader known as Omminus. There are eight regular stages to move through, each hiding five medallions for the player to find. Environments include the tops of tropical trees, grottoes under the sea, and beaches. Besides these regular stages, there are also eight extra stages and eight bonus mini-games.</p>",

Unlike most dance games, <em>Michael Jackson: The Experience</em> does not require the Wii Balance Board or other peripherals. The game is played with a single Wii Remote which tracks the player as they try and perform the onscreen dance moves in-sync with the game. The Wii version features a training mode with video guides, four player multiplayer, and a Career mode that spans Jackson's career from the 80's onward. Each stage is inspired by the song's music video and are created in 3D with live action dancers inserted. The Wii version includes the following songs: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bad</li>\n<li>Beat It</li>\n<li>Billie Jean</li>\n<li>Black Or White </li>\n<li>Dirty Diana </li>\n<li>Don't Stop Till You Get Enough</li>\n<li>Earth Song</li>\n<li>Ghosts</li>\n<li>Heal The World</li>\n<li>In The Closet</li>\n<li>Leave Me Alone</li>\n<li>Money</li>\n<li>Remember The Time</li>\n<li>Rock With You</li>\n<li>Smooth Criminal</li>\n<li>Speed Demon</li>\n<li>Streetwalker</li>\n<li>Sunset Driver</li>\n<li>The Girl Is Mine</li>\n<li>The Way You Make Me Feel</li>\n<li>They Don't Care About Us</li>\n<li>Thriller</li>\n<li>Wanna Be Startin' Something</li>\n<li>Who Is It</li>\n<li>Will You Be There</li>\n<li>Workin' Day And Night</li>\n</ul>",

Created by the normally evil, but ready to change his ways Dr. Eggman, the park floats in space above Sonic's home planet and opens to much fanfare. All seems decent enough, until Sonic uncovers the truth. An alien race known as the Wisps have been taken hostage by Dr. Eggman, who's using their unique powers to deadly use inside the theme park itself. Sonic arrives to save the day, of course, and discovers that the Wisps are happy to aid him in his quest, as well as share their powers with the blue blur.</p>\n<p><em>Sonic Colors</em> (or colours, depending on your country of birth) combines the Sonic staple of speed and platforming, similar to the Sonic only levels in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Sonic+Unleashed\">Sonic Unleashed</a> or the classic Sega titles of the past, and changes perspective from 3rd person just behind the lead character, or side-scrolling 2D at certain points during the game (not unlike another platform adventure in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/31282/super-mario-galaxy/\">Super Mario Galaxy</a>). But it's the Wisps abilities that add a little edge to Sonic's usual speed thrills. Each of the eight Wisp's can be used temporarily when available, and grant Sonic the ability to tunnel through dirt, or become a deadly laser that can bounce off certain surfaces, or a rocket that can blast high into the air at high speed to reach areas otherwise unreachable, just to name a few.</p>\n<p>A Sonic Simulator mode can also be unlocked during play by collecting special red rings dotted around each level. These challenges can be played by one or two players in one-on-one or co-op modes.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Swords</em> comes to the Wii, slinging sword-fighting action in tow. <em>Swords</em> features a gameplay set-up similar to the highly-loved Nintendo franchise <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Punch-Out!!\">Punch-Out!!</a></em> in that a single player takes control of a character working through a series of one-on-one battles between the player and a colorful on-screen character. </p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>Like <em>Punch-Out!!</em>, the viewpoint of the game is behind the player's transparent on-screen character as they fight a CPU opponent head-on. Also like <em>Punch-Out!!</em>, the gameplay is set up in a block-counter-attack-block format. Essentially, the focus of the sword-fighting action encourages the player to watch the opponents movements carefully so as to successfully block the attacks.</p>\n<p>General gameplay is performed entirely using the Wii Remote with Wii Motion Plus for one-to-one sword-fighting motion. However, the attacks are only recorded by the Wii through seven directions--up, left, right, and the four diagonal positions around them. Holding the A button charges a Chi special attack and holding the Button performs a block move that must be targeted to the incoming attack of the opponent. A correctly angled block results in a \"Perfect Block\" leaving the opponent open to a counter-attack. These are typically the most successful strikes against opponents.</p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong></p>\n<p>Through the basic Campaign mode, the player portrays a single character named Hiro--again, like in <em>Punch-Out!!</em> with Little Mac--and works through a series of battles all guided by a personal Sensei who gives tips and new weapons. Between every Campaign battle, there are also a series of mini-game challenges such as defeating a bunch of zombies, cutting thrown objects, carving shapes from a log, or attacking a suit of armor in a series of strikes that play out like the old Simon electronic game. The Sensei (Sensei Musashi) also trains the player on how to play the game and provides details on the story arc.</p>\n<p>There are eight characters to face in the single-player campaign with themes familiar to many video games, including a Viking, a pirate, a knight, an Arabian (princess no less) and so forth.</p>\n<p><strong>Modes</strong></p>\n<p>Besides the single-player Campaign mode, there are three other gameplay modes: Versus mode has two players hacking and slashing at each other with the main character (Hiro) and another named Jake that are roughly doppelgangers--again, very similar to the Wii revamp of <em>Punch-Out!!</em> (except there, it's just two Little Macs). Quick-Match mode allows the player to play single bouts against any unlocked opponent in the game. Quick-Minigame allows a single player to replay any of the between-match mini-games found during the main Campaign.</p>",

A series of Ju-On horror movies all by the same director have been popular since 2000 first in Japan and then remade in Hollywood first in 2004 as The Grudge.  This is a \"haunted house simulator\" adventure game where Erika Yamada comes into contact with a curse when looking for her dog in an abandoned warehouse.  Then when she returns home, all her family  members who she meets also become cursed.  You play as each in first-person view encountering their own challenging episode.  </p>\n<p>The locations vary from a rundown factory to an empty hospital, an apartment building, a mannequin factory, and the cursed house from the movie.  The game is basically an interactive horror movie which tries to scare you as you explore the locations and attempt to survive against the supernatural forces.  The Wii remote controls the player's flashlight and movement through the game.  If the player flinches at scare moments with the remote, their score goes down.  A person with a second remote can also trigger scary events for the main player.  The player must keep moving while finding keys to open doors and also find batteries to replenish the flashlight or else you will be attacked and die.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Contra -ReBirth-</em> follows on the heels of other contemporary <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Konami\">Konami</a> titles that revisit classic series, such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/31210/contra-4/\">Contra 4</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Castlevania+The+Adventure+ReBirth\">Castlevania: The Adventure ReBirth</a> with a throw-back to the original styling. <em>ReBirth</em> is much like <em>Contra 4</em> as it follows on the heels of the SNES classic, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5619/contra-iii-the-alien-wars/\">Contra III: The Alien Wars</a>. It returns to the franchise's classic sprite-based side-scrolling gameplay, featuring intense boss battles and rampant run-n-gun action throughout. It is the twelfth main game in the series.</p>\n<p>The game takes place in 1973 where a force known as the Neo-Salamander Force has travelled from 2633 in order to destroy the Contra force and Earth's defenses preemptively. Series mainstay Bill Rizer and Genbei Yagyu of the Contra force are deployed back in time to stop the Neo-Salamander Force. Two other playable characters are also available when certain conditions are met in the game and they are: Browny (a robot), and Pliskin (a lizard-like alien). </p>\n<p>Besides the graphical style from <em>Contra III</em>, the most obvious other influence is the inclusion of the dual-weapon system originally introduced in the SNES incarnation. The Spreadgun, Homing gun, and Laser all make a return as well. However, the weapon upgrade system from <em>Contra 4</em> is absent (picking up the same weapon a second time would double its power and graphical flair). The game also features a two-player co-op option like the original titles in the series.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Biggest Loser is a health and lifestyle game for the Nintendo Wii, compatible with the Wii Balance Board. Based on the hit NBC reality TV show the game mirrors the format of the show by featuring intense training routines, weekly challenges, nutritional goals and information and the iconic weekly weigh-in and elimination from the show.</p>\n<p>Created with the support of the personal trainers, doctors and nutritionists from the TV show, the game features voiceovers from the show\u2019s most famous trainers, Bob Harper and Jillian Michaels. Their dialogue is used throughout the training routines to provide detailed instruction, safety information, tips and player feedback. The game also features a wide range of healthy recipes sourced from various Biggest Loser cookbooks as well as the official The Biggest Loser Club website.</p>\n<p>The focus of the Biggest Loser\u2019s training is on providing real weight loss and fitness results through hand crafted fitness routines, designed to burn calories and build muscle mass. Following from the principles of circuit training that are central to the workouts found in the TV show, the game aims to keep the player moving by changing exercises every 30 to 60 seconds. The game features 66 exercise routines created from a set of 88 different exercises covering a wide range of intensities and muscle groups. Exercise routines can last between 20 and 80 minutes, depending on the player\u2019s chosen difficulty level.</p>\n<p>Notably player failure during the exercise routines is not punished by stopping the routine, instead the dynamic feedback dialogue from the trainers is used to motivate the player to push themselves within their abilities. This ensures that the carefully designed pacing of the fitness routines is maintained throughout, significantly reducing player frustration and helping them to get the results they desire.</p>\n<p>When engaged in a full fitness program the player first selects a one of the previous show contestants to represent them as an in-game character. The game features a total of 8 different characters taken from the first 5 series of the TV show. After entering a number of critical pieces of personal information and selecting a difficulty and goal the player is given a number of fitness routines to complete in each week, followed by a single challenge game and the weigh-in event. </p>\n<p>The challenge games were influenced by the challenges found in the TV show, and set the player a number of exercises to perform in order to move their in-game character through the event. Unlike the exercise routines, the challenges require the player to successfully complete each exercises to progress through the game. Upon completing a round of the challenge event, the player is shown the scores achieved by their AI competitors. In each round the lowest scoring character is eliminated until only two characters remain. In the final round, the highest scoring character wins.</p>\n<p>All training and challenge results are fed into a comprehensive scoring system alongside the player\u2019s real weight change and diet tracking information during the weekly weigh-ins. The player\u2019s combined score is then represented through their chosen character\u2019s weight loss. In each week of the competition the characters who have lost the least weight are then up for elimination. A vote then follows to determine which character is eliminated. As the player progresses through the game, their chosen character will visibly lose weight, mirroring the player\u2019s success towards their personal fitness or weight loss goal.</p>\n<p>The competition fitness and weight loss programs available for the player can last either 4, 8 or 12 weeks. The in-game character who has lost the most weight at the end of the program is crowned The Biggest Loser.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>All Star Karate</em> consists of three game modes through which the player gets to experience the life of a karate trainee on the path to becoming a black belt.</p>\n<p>Story Mode is the main focus of the single player experience, in which the player follows a storyline in which they learn from (and about!) their aged Sensei. Reaching goals in Story Mode also unlocks the trials in Challenge Mode and the Kata Editor, from which players can exercise their creativity and practice their moves. The all-encompassing theme is the use of different Wii Remote gestures that correspond to a variety of karate moves. The game supports the use of a regular Wii Remote plus Nunchuck set-up, as well as Dual Wii Remote support for added accuracy. The Wii MotionPlus peripheral is also supported throughout the game, and allows access to the At The Movies mini game.  </p>\n<p>The events in <em>All Star Karate</em> are based around six mini games. Each of those can also be played with a friend. In particular, 17 characters can be unlocked and pitted against each other in 2-player sparring games.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Kata Routine: Follow the icons that appear on-screen to perform a sequence of elegant karate moves. Kata Routines may be long, exhibition performances or sequences to teach combo moves via muscle-memory for use during sparring bouts.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Follow My Lead: Perform moves with Sensei but take care \u2013 he will gradually lengthen the sequence but only show the new move, forcing you to perform the sequence from memory!</p>\n<p>\u2022 Mirror/Mimic: Sensei tests your reflexes by asking you to perform a series of moves with the added twist that he calls out \u201cMirror\u201d or \u201cMimic\u201d at the last second. When he calls \u201cMirror\u201d, perform the mirror image of the gesture displayed on screen.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Spar Time: Face off against a series of opponents using all the moves and combos you\u2019ve learned. The first to score the target number of points is the winner .</p>\n<p>\u2022 Danger Room: Sensei\u2019s hut is filled with things to smash! Perform the correct gestures to take out the target objects, but make sure you don\u2019t break anything valuable or hurt yourself on the many dangerous, spiky things he also keeps in there.</p>\n<p>\u2022 At The Movies: Ninjas are threatening to ruin your evening\u2019s entertainment at the local cinema! Fight them off with your wooden training sword in this Wii MotionPlus-specific mini game.  </p>\n<p>In addition, three micro games pop up from time-to-time:</p>\n<p>\u2022 Fly Catching: If you spot a fly while navigating through menus, use the Wii Remote as chopsticks to snatch that fly out of the air.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Belt Tying: Quickly perform a series of gestures to tie each new belt you unlock. Do it right, or your pants will fall down in front of a tournament crowd.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Box Breaking: Perform a perfect karate chop to break through the packages you receive as you unlock new features and collectibles.</p>",

Two of these vehicles are licensed Landrovers, while the other two are unlicensed, a quad bike and a Bombardier. The animals are captured in expansive, free-roaming African savannas and brought back to the base for treatment and care.</p>\n<p>In addition to the straight forward arcade style gameplay, the Wii version of the game also includes animal treatment minigames, a larger variety of missions including wildlife photography and balloon rides, co-op missions and several party games as well as fully customizable characters and vehicles.</p>\n<p>The party games include ostrich racing, pebble skimming and the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3725/chuchu-rocket/\">ChuChu Rocket</a>-style 'Meerkat madness'.</p>",

Besides the usual movement controls the focus lies on the new, exclusive street matches with teams of five players each. Here the player can use bound to bounce the ball - similar to hall matches. This mode has a variety of settings, e.g. a wider goal or no goalkeepers. There is even a mode in which the ball directly bounces back into the field after a goal. There are also power ups, e.g. shrinking all enemy athletes or a super shot. The career mode, in which the player creates his own athlete, deals with the rise of a street soccer player. Experience points and team boosts are earned by solving self-directed challenges. </p>\n<p>The other, already familiar exclusive Wii playing mode is All-Play in which movement is taken over by the console and the player only chooses where he wants to pass the ball to. Other than that the game also features regular playing modes like singles matches or leagues as well as a basic management mode.</p>",

Kid Paddle and his friends go play games at the City Game Arcade, but things turn sour when they become trapped inside the game and Kid Paddle's friends are being held captive by the evil blorks. Kid Paddle must journey through four different worlds to save his friends by activating switches, jumping on platforms and fighting many different blorks. It's also possible to play as Little Barbarian and save the princess in two of the game's six worlds.</p>\n<p>The game features the same worlds and story as the Nintendo DS version, but has different gameplay since it's in full 3D (as opposed to the side-scrolling platforming on the DS). The player can collect coins, shoot blorks, buy upgrades from Mirador's shop. The game features traditional platforming elements such as pushing blocks and jumping on platforms. On Wii, the environments are much larger, and the player has wider areas to explore.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Naruto Shipp\u016bden: Gekit\u014d Ninja Taisen! EX 2</em> is a fighting game based upon the <em>Naruto</em> series. The game controls mostly like a traditional 2D fighter where you are always locked on to your opponent and moving towards or away from him/her along a horizontal line, but you can sidestep to dodge attacks. As there can be more than one opponent at a time, you use a button to toggle between them. When attacking or taking damage, you build up a Chakra meter, which can then be used to perform extra powerful attacks where the game shows a short cut scene, or for some characters to morph into a more powerful form.</p>\n<p>The story mode takes you through part of the <em>Naruto Shupp\u016bden</em> series, continuing after the previous game. There is also a versus mode for up to four players, free-for-all or in teams.\nFor this sixth entry in the series, the character roster has been greatly increased since the last <em>EX!</em> game, both bringing back fan favorites such as Sasuke, Hinata, Choji and Shikamaru but also introducing new characters from the <em>Shipp\u016bden</em> series. Two new features are hazardous objects in the arenas, and hand seals to increase power performed using the Wiimote and Nunchuk.</p>",

It contains two of the four campaigns of the original game (USA and Japan) and offers a neutral take on the event, offering players to choose either side.</p>\n<p>The game is a motion-controlled flight simulator in which players can have random dogfights. The game is not meant to be a realistic simulator as aircraft carry unlimited ammunition, limited only by overheating (machine guns) and reloading times (rockets, bombs, and torpedoes). Unlike the original game there are no multiplayer options and the difficulty level has been heightened. The game can be played through three different control schemes: Wii Remote, Classic Controller and/or Wii Remote + Nunchuk.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Pop 'Em Drop 'Em Samegame</em> is a variant of SameGame, a puzzle game concept that was introduced with the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/206839/chain-shot/\">Chain Shot</a> in 1985. </p>\n<p>The player is presented with a board full of blocks and the goal is to remove them all. To remove blocks the player simply clicks on a group of two or more blocks of the same colour. As blocks are removed those above will fall down and fill in the empty space. When columns are emptied the blocks will fill in from the right. The game goes on until there are no more blocks that can be removed. When all blocks on the board have been removed the player will move on to a new board. The player scores for each block removed and larger groups of blocks give the most points. Different options exist that alter the game's difficulty. This include the size of the board (from 9x9 to 22x12) and number of colours (3-5). It is also possible to use bombs that can blow up unwanted blocks.</p>\n<p>The game features multiplayer for up to four players locally. There are three different multiplayer modes: fame game, shame game and blame game. Fame game is most similar to the single player and the player with the highest score wins. Shame game turns it all around; here the player with the lowest score wins. In these modes a player can colourblock the other players by clearing large numbers of blocks. In the blame game all players play on the same board.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>FlatOut</em> is an adaptation for the Wii of the long-running racing series, combining fast-paced racing with ramming opponents and destroying objects in the environment. It contains four different game modes: Racing, Car Basher, Battle Arena and Stunt. There are twelve tracks in total, divided over four chapters. They include environments such as a busy financial district, an industrial port, and villages in Southern Europe.</p>\n<p>Racing is the regular game mode where races have to be won by finishing in first place or wrecking all opponents. Cars have a health meter and there is a damage model with visual clues to the condition. In Car Basher the player's driver chooses one of the twelve available weapons such as a baseball bat or a crowbar, and needs to trash the opponent's car with as much damage as possible before time runs out to win the car. Battle Arena has Destruction Derby-like environments with booby traps, ramps, loopings, and fire for much more destructive gameplay. The main goal is to lure or push other cars into traps. The final game mode is called Stunt and offers classic gameplay from the series where the driver has to be ejected through the windshield at the right angle to reach targets.</p>\n<p>The cars are controlled by holding the Wii Remote horizontally and tilting it to steer. The game can be played locally in multiplayer through a split-screen.</p>",

The game is set in a secret training facility with different levels and there are over 25 different nerf weapons to unlock. The selection of guns includes real and fictional ones. Each guns has a different handling and ammo includes balls, darts and bullets. As with a real nerf gun, bullets do not travel into a straight line and the player has to compensate the floating by aiming a little higher for enemies in the distance.</p>\n<p>The opponents are generally robots and the player only needs to shoot, the camera and general movement is done automatically. In most of the sequences the gun is visible but at specific moments a scope-like zoomed in view appears. In the main mission mode the goal is to beat the score of a challenger. There are also mini-games and smaller challenges that involve painting rolling spheres to make them explode and nailing a target cube through a stack of blocks. It is possible to team up with up to three other players to defeat the N-Strike Elite rivals and B.O.B. the cybernetic training bot.</p>\n<p>The game is bundled with the Nerf Switch Shot EXE-3 gun. The game is also compatible with regular N-Strike guns as the pneumatic pod can be removed to introduce the Wii Remote and to turn it into a light gun. The bundled gun can also be used to shoot regular darts.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Grand Slam Tennis</em> is a tennis game that features venues from all four Grand Slam tournaments; the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open. It includes 14 of the top players at the time of release (e.g. Federer, Nadal and the Williams sisters) and 9 retired tennis legends (e.g. Sampras, McEnroe, Navratilova). The game is played with the Wii Remote and Nunchuck and also has full support for Wii MotionPlus where the timing of the swings is measured. Despite the cartoonish character models it aims to be a tennis simulation game with a learning curve, especially when played with the Wii MotionPlus.</p>\n<p>There are four game modes:* The main career mode allows the player to customize their own character then travel to each of the 4 tournaments and attempt to win the Grand Slam.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Party mode is a collection of mini-games for one to four players. Each features a variation on the rules of tennis.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Play Now allows one to four players to choose their characters, venues and game length and settings for a quick game.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Online mode has players competing against each other in ranked or unranked matches. Winning ranked matches earns the player ranking points and leaderboards display the overall ranking of each player.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

Those are also the only projectiles the enemies will fire. The gist of the game is the variety of weapons: over 25 guns can be of avail to the dauntless agents, some of them being purchasable, some having to be unlocked in different ways; moreover, they all are capable of being customized, and enhanced by power-ups.</p>\n<p>In addition to Story Mode, there is Blasting Range, a score attack mode played on a brief course. Some areas are only available through playing the cooperative mode for two players; up to four players can join the adventure.</p>\n<p>Controls are given by the Wii Remote or by a bundled blaster, the Nerf Switch Shot Ex-3 which houses the Wii Remote. It is an enhanced version of the blaster that came with the preceeding iteration in the series: a red decoder lens attached to it will reveal otherwise-invisible game items such as hidden passages and enemies' weak points.</p>",

The fighting interface offers varied possibilities as regards dodging and blocking attacks, as well as attacking. Offensive options include standard punches, uppercuts, roundhouses and power moves, each tied with a gesture of the player: everything is in fact done uniquely by the Nunchuk and waggling the Wii Remote. Performing the right actions \ntimely is rewarded by the game adding a star to a meter: when it is full, Rumble Mode is entered, getting herculean strength.</p>\n<p>Boxers skills are defined by three parameters: power, speed and defense. They develop following from how well the player does in some training minigames. Game modes are Arcade, Quick Fight (versus the CPU or another player), Championship, Team Fight, Tournament, Create a Boxer (items are unlocked gradually by reaching achievements) and Mini Game (to develop one's boxer's skills). A tutorial and a register of records are also available. Options allow choice regarding the number of rounds (from 1 up to 12), round duration (from a minimum of 30 seconds to 3 minutes), maximum number of knockdowns (from 1 to 6), level of difficulty (there are five) and handicaps for either player.</p>\n<p>Boxers are imitations of renowned people from the show in facial features, while their names (Syphon Cruel, Kaiser Hong, Stoney Rigatoni \u2014 of obvious Italian descent \u2014, Dragon Chew, et alii) are suggestive of their origin or related to their body shape. Secret fighters are unlockable by completing the Championship Mode.</p>",

The Great Elder governs over his happy people, wielding his wisdom: repose reigns. One day, their gleeful lives changes all of a sudden:\na mysterious fleet of extraterrestrial spaceships surrounds the islands,\ntaking over the Legendary Orbs. The aliens in the UFOs are able to avail themselves\nof the awesome energy from the Orbs, acquiring unbelievable power and beginning their descent on Star Ving. It is a dreadful army: treacherous-looking,\nfear-inspiring alive strawberries, peaches, eggplants, watermelons, apples, rice balls,\nmagic mushrooms and more many other ones than it could be believed, all captained by Don Onion, known in the whole universe for the utmost mercilessness of his.\n\u00abWhat will we do?\u00bb, wonders the Elder in dismay, when... unexpectedly he is told\nthat the invaders are tasty, and a flash of genius makes dismay hope: if\nenemies are tasty, they should be eatable! Now the Munchables know what to do.</p>\n<p>In <em>The Munchables</em> the player is given control over one of the two Munchables summoned by the Great Elder \u2014 the belligerant Chomper, a male one, and the pinkish Munchy, a female \u2014, and has to go around and through levels devouring the hostile legions of \nfruits and vegetables.\nThe playing character in the game has a level: trying to swallow enemies of a level higher than Chomper's or Munchy's will end with them being repelled and stroke,\nyet it is possible to perform a dash attack that will split them into creatures\nof a lower level, therefore edible. As they eat, Munchables obviously grow and level up, getting able to gorge bigger enemies.\nOn the completion of a level, the player's performance will \nbe subjected to evaluation: a bonus item is the reward for high enough grades,\nmost of the times consisting in an accessory to embellish Chomper or Munchy.</p>\n<p>Controls depend upon the Remote and the Nunchuk: the player uses the analog stick to move the character; moves\nthe Remote upwards to jump -tilting the stick to make the jump\na forward or an on-a-side one; to eat a space invader, moves in the direction \nof it and presses the A button when in the vicinity of it; \nholds Z on the Nunchuk to lock on an enemy as their target; holds down A and, \nwhen having charged it enough, unleashes the Turbo Eat power to gourmandise all the unlucky enemies in a row realizing a combo; presses B to strike it by the dash attack parting it, when coming into an enemy of a level superior than theirs. It is possible for two players to join forces in a co-operative mode, as well as to play Mirror mode, in which stages are changed in the manner of an image reflected by a mirror and a stringent time limit compels the player to haste.</p>",

The in-ball characters are made roll to the goal by inclining the stage in any direction by less or more degrees. New from the preceding instalments of the series is the possibility to use\nthe Wii Balance Board to perform in-game jumps, while the inclination of the playfield is still given moving the Wii Remote however; it is possible to make no use of the balance board at all. More or fewer obstacles are scattered through the courses depending upon the control method chosen, since using the balance board makes it more demanding to play per se.</p>\n<p>The single-player mode consists of levels bracketed in the number of ten in a quantity of themed worlds; each world is regarded as unrelated with the others, and, since that, the completion of it will lead to the game's credits (that are not capable of being skipped). Levels can be played in co-operative mode: one will use the Wii Remote, one the balance board. More obstacles are placed into levels if two players co-operate. Multi-player mode can be joined by up to four players and makes use of split-screen view to display the action. Marathon mode demands to live without dying even once through the first half of game's levels, the second half of them, or all of them one after the other. There are minigames designed for one, two, and up to four players (to play each with a Wii Remore, or a player using the Wii Balance Board and the others up to three Wii Remote) to battle against each other.</p>\n<p>Indicators shown (not optionally) on screen during the game play are: the speed meter on the bottom left, the number of lives and bananas gathered (an extra life is awarded for each 20 bananas gathered, unlike for 100 as in the series' origins) and the current score on the top right, the timer on the top left (1 minute is the time given to complete a stage). Stages are named and not merely numbered. The fifth level in each world is a bonus stage with fifty bananas to take. The score on levels' end results from Time Score (a hundred points per each second left) added to Stage Score (a hundred multiplied by the stage number points) and Clear Score (equal to Stage Score diminished by a hundred points and a hundred points for each bonus stage played in that world world), thus valuing swiftness.</p>",

In single player the goal is to last a long as possible. In multi-player the goal is to score more points than your opponent within a 90 second round. The motion is simulated through a combination of the Wii Remote and the Nunchuk. They are aimed forward and then inwards simultaneously to mimic the motion.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is very similar to <em>Game and Watch</em> games in that the goal is to get a high score, all the while having the difficulty ramp up during gameplay. The game is only available to Club Nintendo members.</p>",

Unlike the previous games, which were mini-game compilations, <em>Rabbids Go Home</em> is an action-adventure game with platforming and racing elements. The Rabbids, now living in \"our\" world, surmise that their home is the Moon. They decide to travel there by the only way they know how: building a large pile of junk so high that they will be able to climb up to the giant orb in the sky. In order to get the junk, the Rabbids travel through various urban environments in a shopping cart, collecting as much random stuff as they possibly can while avoiding an increasingly hostile human populace.</p>\n<p>The player controls the shopping cart as the Rabbids move through each level. While holding down A, the cart picks up speed, but at the cost of losing control. When blue sparks appear under the cart, the player can press the B button to perform a boost, which allows the cart to jump over across gaps and other obstacles using ramps, or smash larger items into more grab-able pieces. The player can also yell at enemies, which either destroys them completely or knocks much of their clothes off. The player uses these and other moves to navigate through cities, shopping malls, office buildings, hospitals, and many more environments. The game includes a very eclectic licensed pop soundtrack as well as multiple ways to customize the Rabbids.</p>",

While gathering resources to survive, day by day they will discover new areas of the island by exploring it and have to think over how to advance, that will be similar to read puzzles. Activities and actions necessary to survive, typical to the <em>Lost in Blue</em> franchise, such as making fires and fishing, can now for the first time in the series be performed by moving the Wii Remote in a way that imitates what the moves would be in reality. This time however, the protagonists have pet animals as companions in adventure to help them with their skills: for instance, they play music, dance, collect items that the human characters could not.</p>\n<p>Like in previous instalments, there is an offer of mini-games (more than thirteen, this time); new is the possibility to play a selection of these cooperatively. The game is provided with more than one unique ending, and more than one single plot-line, in consequence of the character chosen as the main one.</p>",

A magic book has been infected with a bottle of ink known as the Influence. In order to save the book from corruption, you must pick up the book in your hands and tilt it to move a source of water around its colorful pages. </p>\n<p>You'll use this water to hit switches, collect gears and fish to open up new areas, and defeat the Influence's minions. In addition, tilting the book also controls various machinery, including a crane, a pinball machine, and a monorail.</p>\n<p>The player uses the water to collect Rainbow Drops, which act as the main means of progression in the game. As more drops are collected, new areas of the book open up for the player to explore. The player also receives various powers along the way, such as the ability to change into solid and gas forms. Many of the raindrops can only be collected after the player has received these forms and their powers.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>WarioWare: D.I.Y. Showcase</em> is a WiiWare game, the first <em>WarioWare</em> title for the format. It is designed as a showcase for all the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=WarioWare+D.I.Y.\">WarioWare: D.I.Y.</a> products, such as microgames, music and comics. The game features connectivity with the Nintendo DS game <em>WarioWare: D.I.Y.</em> New microgames, different from the ones seen in <em>WarioWare: D.I.Y.</em>, come pre-loaded on this game, but additional games can be obtained from the DS, other Wii consoles, or from Nintendo via Nintendo WFC. The player can also send microgames to others from Wii to Wii, or from Wii to DS.</p>\n<p>Microgames are organized by character: Wario-Man, Dribble &amp; Spitz, Kat &amp; Ana, and 18-Volt. Wario-Man microgames feature Wario himself, Dribble and Spitz microgames involve science fiction, Kat and Ana microgames involve animals, and 18-Volt microgames feature Nintendo products. This makes for a total of 72 microgames which differ from the the 90 microgames seen in <em>WarioWare: D.I.Y.</em>.</p>\n<p>After all microgames are accounted for, Shuffle Stages are unlocked. These stages feature all the microgames in the game. Upon completing five microgames, the speed gets higher.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Rune Factory Frontier's story begins with the hero Raguna traveling to the village of Trampoli in search of his missing friend Mist. However, once he finds her, she reveals that she has been hearing the calls of someone in her dreams. Raguna investigates for her and discovers that the mysterious whale shaped island over the village not only can speak but is in danger of falling and destroying Trampoli. Now Raguna must solve the mysteries of Whale Island as well as explore Trampoli's dungeons to find a solution to the danger that plagues the village.</p>\n<p>Rune Factory Frontier was the first of the series to be released on the Wii. Much like its Nintendo DS counterparts, you own a farm, can grow crops, befriend villagers, get married and fight in dungeons. One major difference in Frontier compared to the previous games is the introduction of the Runey system, a mini-ecosystem you must manage that can either help or hurt crop growth. This particular game reprises many familiar faces from the first game on the DS, including Mist, Rosetta, Melody, and Lara. However, there are also many new bachelorettes for you to choose from. Another feature added with this game are the animated cutscenes for events and first meetings with the girls. While there is voice acting in this game, not every line of dialogue is done.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Red Steel 2</em> is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/25102/red-steel/\">Red Steel</a> and just like the original game it is a brawler played from a first-person perspective. The game trades the modern day urban setting for an Old West environment mixed with Eastern influences and even some science-fiction elements. It also introduces a new story not related to the first game. The visual design has been changed from a realistic style to a looser cel shaded design. The unnamed male protagonist is the last member of the Kusagari clan. After a period of exile, he returns to his desert home city Caldera, where he finds out that his clan has been exterminated and the city taken over by the Jackals gang. As they hunt him down, he barely escapes but loses his treasured Sora katana to them. Freeing his old swordsmaster Jian, he borrows his sword to take on the task of retrieving the katana and vanquishing the gang of bandits led by their leader Payne who conspires with Shinjiro, the main antagonist and a former member of the Kusagari who killed almost everyone to reveal the mysterious katana's powers.</p>\n<p>The main story consists of different missions that are listed on a blackboard in a safe house. The hero does not have to work alone, he is assisted by the young Asian girl Tamiko, Jian and the drunk sheriff Judd who contribute to the story. Once the safe house is left, various Jackals can be engaged alternating between sword fighting and shooting. Up to six enemies on-screen can be fought at once and enemy packs can go up to twenty. Next to attacking, the sword can also be used to deflect bullets. New weapons, techniques and armors can be earned and upgraded by progressing through the game in exchange for money. Cash can be found in every level hidden in bags, safes, boxes, but Jian also provides it after successful moves and combos. Additional money can be earned through optional side missions. Judd's shop offers a rifle and a machine gun in addition to the regular pistol. The focus is however largely on the swordfighting. The visited scenery eventually moves on from the dusty town to lush gardens and train sequences. Often there are bosses at the end of levels that are much harder to defeat. The direction for quests is marked on a mini-map through a green arrow and after completion the hero need to travel back to the home base. Later levels also introduce small puzzle elements.</p>\n<p>As the first game to support the Wii MotionPlus add-on peripheral, the control detection is more refined than in games with a regular controller. Optionally a Relaxed configuration can be enabled to increase the sensitivity so as to make a smaller and less-fatiguing arm reach possible.</p>",

Like the <em>Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon</em> games before them, they are very similar, yet have key differences. In this case, the differences are names and layouts of dungeons, playable Pok\u00e9mon, and Pok\u00e9mon available as recruits. Playable Pok\u00e9mon and partners are chosen rather than taking a quiz. Mezase! Hikari no B\u014dkendan has the following playable Pok\u00e9mon: Pikachu, Meowth, Psyduck, Pichu, Togepi, Mareep, Elekid, Shinx, and Pachirisu. These games are not as plot-based as previous games in the series.</p>",

The player can match one of the four poses using the Wiimote and Nunchuk.</p>\n<p>One by one, all the other bodybuilders slip on banana peels and fall graciously out of the race, while the thief gets gradually faster. Eventually, the player will remain the last one standing and will have to perform a takedown on the culprit by furiously shaking both the Wiimote and the Nunchuk. If this fails, the race continues until another opportunity arises. Hitting a wall removes one of five stamina points. Once all the stamina is lost, it's game over, but the same stage can then be replayed with maximum stamina. The single-player mode features three levels (City, Village and Space Station) with three stages each. The multiplayer mode (Endless Rush) is an endless rainbow level where the speed increases by 5 or 1 MPH after every five walls. Up to four players take turns to see who can survive the longest.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A prequel to <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/driver\">Driver</a>, the second Wii <em>Driver</em> game (developed specifically for this platform) is similarly based in San Francisco, but contains a specifically separate storyline to <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/driver-san-francisco\">Driver: San Francisco</a>. Featuring Detective John Tanner, the game follows his early years (1970s to 1980s) on the force. While still a uniformed police officer his partner is murdered in an unexpected drive-by shooting by Solomon Caine, an ambitious criminal who aims to disturb the fragile peace between the city's other gangs. With Tanner still a little green when it comes to undercover work, he's assigned back-up in the form of Tobias Jones, a more experienced cop. Tanner hits the streets as a gifted rookie and attempts to take down a crime syndicate controlling San Francisco\u2019s underworld.</p>\n<p>The game's story mode (built as a classic crime tale) has the player alternating between all three characters (thus told from the 3 perspectives): Tanner on his first undercover assignment is trying to find out who killed his partner; Tobias Jones (his partner) on the street gives back-up and chases leads; and Solomon Caine has a plan, but no one knows what it is.</p>\n<p>The Wii version is a free-roaming action racing game in the vein of the original, does not include the other version's \"Shift\" mechanic, and allows players to use guns while driving. The player can drive numerous licensed cars across the open city of San Francisco, undertake various challenges and partake in an unlimited number of random chases, thanks to a consistent felony system. There is a total of 11 chapters that gives access to 30 story missions (race, chase or escape enemies, etc), 10 larger critical missions, 30 optional side missions and 58 unique awards linked to in-game activities. During the races, the opponents can either be taken down with melee attacks and in-car shoot-outs using a variety of weapons, or left behind with shunts and nitro boosts. Performing tricks and scoring awards are rewarded with points that, in turn, are used to upgrade weapons in various categories.</p>\n<p>Multiplayer modes in offline split-screen allow up to 4 players, with game variants like Capture The Flag, Pass The Bomb, Gold Rush and Elimination, and a cops and robbers split-screen mode. At the same time, the drop in/out multiplayer co-op in story mode allows a buddy to help by taking control of a weapon.</p>\n<p>This version of <em>Driver: San Francisco</em> also features Nintendo DS/DSi/3DS connectivity through download play, that can be used as a guide, weapon, make road blocks, look for police, or buy player 1 some more time through various mini games.</p>",

It shares the story (Spider-Man has to rescue Manhattan from the Virus which made Curt Connors to Lizard), voice-overs and level set-pieces. However, there is one very important difference: the absence of all open-world elements. Peter Parker's apartment serves as hub from where the player chooses the next destination. This is usually the next level or a boss fight, but there are also challenge maps (either defeating a number of enemies within a given time frame or stealthily knocking out enemies) available. Solving missions rewards experience points which are used to improve Spider-Man's abilities.</p>\n<p>Combat is similar to the main version and still takes many cues from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/42258/batman-arkham-asylum/\">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a>: Spider-Man quickly switches between enemies and punches them; when the spider-sense is activated he can dodge and perform a counter-attack. A not disrupted flow builds up a counter which, when high enough, is used to perform a powerful attack. The web rush ability slows down time and allows Spider-Man to pick a destination to swing to. This can be used for surprise attacks or quick retreats.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Young brothers Asbel and Hubert Lhant are exploring the forbidden Lhant Hill when they stumble across a purple-haired girl, lying in a meadow of flowers. She doesn't remember anything about herself, so the boys decide to give her a name: Sophie. Along with their friend Cheria, the children quickly befriend her and a boy named Richard, the prince of Windor. But when the children are attacked by a strange monster, Sophie sacrifices herself for their sake and the group quickly separates. Asbel leaves to become a knight, beginning his training at the Knight Academy. Years later, Asbel is just about ready for knighthood. At the same time, strange otherworldly monsters begin to make appearances all over the planet, and the Sophie who was presumed dead years ago returns once again.</p>\n<p><em>Tales of Graces</em> is the twelfth game in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/1717/tales-series/\">Tales series</a>, following a format similar to its predecessors. Exploration takes place on a field where items can be collected or side-quests can be initiated; coming into contact with an enemy begins a battle. Battles follow the Style Shift Linear Motion Battle System, in which simple attacks and special skills are executed in real-time. Skills are performed through button combinations which may be mapped in menus beforehand, and are split into two categories: Assault Artes are special attacks done on the spot while Burst Artes are actions which must be charged, such as healing spells. The amount of attacks that can be performed in one combo is regulated by Chain Capacity, more frequently referred to in-game as CC. When CC is used up, it can be replenished by blocking, walking, or simply waiting. The number of CC available for each combo increases as characters level up, allowing for more powerful and intricate combos as more attacks are learned.</p>\n<p>New to <em>Graces</em> is the Eleth Mixer. Obtained during adulthood, the Eleth Mixer serves three primary purposes based on the items which can be assigned to it: placing food in the Mixer gives that dish the opportunity to cook during battle, providing the party with its effects. Materials can be placed and duplicated in the Mixer, useful for farming rare materials. Lastly, books assigned to the Mixer give special bonuses to the party in and out of battle. Obtaining the Eleth Mixer also grants the party an Eleth Gauge during battle. Maxing out the gauge gives the party the chance to perform Mystic Artes, special attacks that are learned by each character through story events which deal damage based on how high the party's current hit count is.</p>",

Although the graphics have a comic-style the cars are licenced.</p>\n<p>The races include classical circuit races, K.O. races, time trials, and races where you have to pass a certain point at the highest speed possible. Also the Drag- and Driftraces introduced in The Need for Speed Underground series are here as well. In this part the police is present again providing high speed chases with the player with the possibility to take their side too.</p>\n<p>New to the series are Power Ups which repair your car during an event for example since cars can get damaged even to the point that the performance is affected.</p>\n<p>The action takes place on public roads which can be found in Singapore, Madrid, Cairo, Rio de Janeiro and Dubai.</p>",

The game is separated in a number of missions leading to a boss fight. A number of foes, displayed in the lower-right corner, must be found and defeated in each stage. While exploring, the Weapon follows the Meister in human form, and changes into a weapon when enemies are encountered. Health is replenished by sun icons found by breaking crates lying around during exploration phases. Once the target number of defeated foes is reached, the level is cleared, and the player is rated on clear time, damage taken, number of hits and level bonus. The next mission can then be selected.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Unique to the Wii, this installment of <em>Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands</em> tells a new chapter in the adventures of the titular Prince. </p>\n<p>This story begins with a small marketplace, where the Prince acquires a small fairy-like genie, Zhara, for a ridiculous price. His wishes are predictable: a kingdom of his own to prove his worth to his father, and a princess to marry. Zhara guides the Prince to the lost kingdom of Izdihar, where it does not take long for the Prince to realize the treachery: Izdihar is in ruins, overrun by mutant vegetation, and all its inhabitants have been corrupted by a master-plant known as the Haoma. Zhara states that the Prince will have to prove his worth in order to earn his kingdom.</p>\n<p>In <em>Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands</em>, the player controls the Prince as he runs on walls, climbs, fights enemies, uses magical powers, and generally parkours his way around obstacles and traps. He is accompanied by the genie Zhara, a fairy-like djinn that can be controlled by a second player. Zhara helps the Prince in his adventures, offering advice, riddles and history lessons about the kingdom of Izdihar. If controlled by a player, the genie can freeze enemies in combat, slow down traps, and do magic to help the Prince in his acrobatics. Non-playable characters include people from the kingdom of Izdihar. A corrupted king, his daughter Nasreen, and multiple minions that once were human but now wear masks in a useless effort to hide their mutations caused by the evil plant Haoma.</p>\n<p>The game uses the Wii motion controls extensively in all sorts of ways. Movement is generally achieved with the thumbstick located on the Nunchuk, with options to roll, jump, and use magical powers located on the Wiimote. The pointing ability of the Wiimote is also used to solve puzzles, activate gameplay elements and attack enemies. In combat, the motion-sensing abilities of the Wiimote and Nunchuk are put to use, using simple arm gestures to make the Prince do a variety of attacks.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Academy of Champions: Soccer</em> is a soccer game which focuses on arcade action. The player takes the role of a new initiate at the Brightfield Academy which teaches soccer. Depending on the chosen gender of the playing character, the mentor is either <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pel%C3%A9\">Pel\u00e8</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/1354054/mia-hamm/\">Mia Hamm</a> which are both retired soccer athletes. Here the player advances the career by participating in training mini games and matches, talking to other people, choosing teammates, buying stat-boosting equipment or using earned experience points to improve four ability scores. This mode is the heart of the game and otherwise there are only the options to play mini games or a quick match.</p>\n<p>The arcade approach is most obvious on the field itself: each team consists of only five athletes and each player has a special talent which is a over-the-top super move. It can only be activated when the associated bar is filled with successful actions. However, it is also drained by performing small moves like dodging or sprinting. During matches there are also frequent mini games (mostly hammering buttons) to decide duels between two athletes. The whole game is presented in a comic look and there are cameos of characters from other Ubisoft franchises. The controls are either simplified (only Remote) or standard (Remote and Nunchuk); the MotionPlus and Balance Board support is only for specific mini games.</p>",

The game now contains three difficulty levels, each with their own version of the character. On easy Quote takes less damage and enemies die quicker.

        "description": "<p>In <em>Ant Nation</em>, the player controls an ant hive and has to keep them save by expanding. There is no story, but it is implied that the player takes the role of a scientist who experiments with the hive: all interactions with the ants takes place through tools, e.g. a pipette to quickly move them to one place to another, a magnifying glass to inspect the environment or a pointer to select a single ant.</p>\n<p>The basic game structure is that the ants have to collect food and bring it to the hive in order to expand the population and grow stronger. The food is purchased (and then dropped in the playing field) with gold which is earned by completing missions (solving tasks - usually killing invaders - within a time frame). Outside the (finite) missions, gold can be found by searching the environment with the magnifying glass and food by killing invaders which sometime show up. While sheer numbers play an important role, each ant also has statistics which influence the outcome. These can be improved by squeezing them enough to come seriously hurt, but not enough to die. Later in the game, more torturing tools (e.g. a Bunsen burner) are unlocked.</p>\n<p>In addition to the main playing mode, there is a bonus game with 20 levels in which the player uses weapons (e.g. a hammer or rocket launcher) to kill as many ants as possible within a time limit.</p>",

This time you are contacted by Winston Malgrave who claims to be the last of the wealthy Malgrave line. He needs your help on a rather remote tropical island that his family acquired long ago. The island was known as a type of Shangri-La with legendary water sources that could restore youth and vigor. Some sort of incident has occurred and driven many of the island's inhabitants away. Malgrave needs you to return to the island and avoid its many dangers. He has promised to help guide you through by way of remote communication. He mentions some lofty medical discovery on the island that the world could greatly benefit from. It comes in the form of a mysterious powder with amazing healing properties. Currently the world will have to wait for this miracle substance, but Winston Malgrave desperately needs the player to collect it quickly from around the island in order to revive his beloved wife Sara before it\u2019s too late.</p>\n<p>The game style is graphic adventure with hidden object scenes. At the bottom of the screen are words indicating the objects that need to be found. The objects will require you to use the Wii remote to pan back and forth to find objects in the scene. The panning function also has a 3D perspective view that when fully left or right in the scene can obscure or reveal other objects from view. Items collected into your inventory are used in solving other puzzle elements of the plot/story. These objects are scattered throughout the game and sometimes are used in combination with other items to solve puzzles and advance overall gameplay. The Wii remote is also used for general movement through the game environment. The game also has 3 additional modes of play for up to 4 players. These allow others to assist in finding objects with additional Wii remotes at anytime. You can also play challenge modes of who can find objects the quickest or by countdown timer.</p>",

A spinning wheel (with items such as 'swap cash total with another player', additional cash or losing an amount) is used to mix up things between rounds, but this can also be disabled. There are 24 types of podiums available for the contestants, unlocked gradually. There are different types of quiz modes (Classic Quiz, Face Off, Last One Standing, Hot Seat), difficulty levels and the number of rounds can be determined.

        "description": "<p><em>M&amp;M's Beach Party</em> is a game based on the <em>M&amp;M's</em> chocolate brand with a beach party theme. Players select an M&amp;M's character based on five colours (red, orange, green, yellow or blue) and then get to explore a beach environment that offers six mini-games for up to four players. Open spots can be filled in with computer-controlled players, so the game can also be played alone. The mini-games are Kayak Racing, Mr. Runch Slam, Ring Toss, Skee Ball, Target Shooting and Volleyball. They are however locked at the start and only become available after collecting a number of items such as shells. Additional game variants, such as faster moving lily pads in the Mr. Runch Slam game, are also unlocked in the same way. Each game shows some instructions before it is played.</p>\n<p>In Ring Toss the characters stand on a pier and need to throw ring discs onto buoys in the ocean. The A button is used to switch between angling and strafing and the B button is used to pull back and throw. Skee Ball has similar controls. First the character needs to move to line up the shot and then the B button is used to swing. Volleyball is played from a side-view with up to two players per team serving, receiving, passing and smashing the ball. Timing is important so as not to drop the ball. Target Shooting plays like a shooting gallery game where players move the cross-hairs against a static background to sling paint at characters and objects. The Wii Remote needs to be shaken to refill the can of paint. Mr. Runch Slam shows a chocolate pond with floating M&amp;M's lily pads. The player has to time launching an object by smashing a hammer to hit the pads to score. It is also possible to rotate to change the angle. Kayak Racing is a fast race in the ocean with kayaks to reach the finish line first. Games have multiple difficulty levels.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Monkey Mischief!: Party Time</em> is a collection of 20 mini-games for up to four players. Four monkeys have escaped from their prison, using a banana to unlock their cell door, and now they cause mischief in a village. Each game only lasts one minute, so different games can be played quickly in succession. The titles are divided into four groups and have to be unlocked gradually. Many games and assets are very identical to the earlier <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/90661/block-party/\">Block Party</a> by the same developer, but now with a monkey theme.</p>\n<p>In Crowd Control the monkey needs to pump the nunchuck like a water pump to spray water at bird that appears from the back of the screen. In Crazy Bucket Rhino the monkeys descend from a swing and can hop down to collect food and goodies. They need to collect as much as possible and then head back up, but when they leave the swing they are exposed to a rampaging rhino that can cause the monkey to lose everything that was collected. In another game players swing a rhino by its tail like in the hammer throw sport to launch the rhino over water in a specific direction that needs to be timed to collect items. In Monkey Masterpiece players need to trace a shape with the Wii Remote. If they fail to follow the shape a monkey sitting in the back will scream.</p>\n<p>Monkey Dodgeball is a game of dodgeball played in teams of two monkeys with multiple balls thrown at once. In another game players shoot toilet rolls from a first-person perspective towards monkeys appearing from and dancing on toilets. There is also a mini-game called Monkey Memory based on the cups and balls magic routine where players have to guess where a ball is, moving quickly between and under three cups. If they guess wrong, a monkey in the back is electrocuted. In a pogo game the monkeys bounce in a small circle and need to knock each other out. In Salmon Slap players use the nunchuck's analog stick to move around a circular arena. They then swing the Wii Remote to hit an opponent with a fish.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Hello Kitty: Seasons</em> the players gets to design a character that is appointed deputy mayor of Sanrio Town, under the guidance of Hello Kitty, in the game's Adventure mode. The character can freely move around the town and gets to talk to different characters to receive quests and help out, similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Harvest+Moon\">Harvest Moon</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/4468/animal-crossing-series/\">Animal Crossing</a> series. The game uses the cycle of four seasons and each season takes ten in-game days, except for the first year that acts largely as a tutorial with three-day seasons. To move on to a new season, a number of mini-games have to be completed as they advance time by one day each. Walking around town and completing regular tasks does not advance time. The look of the town and the environment, the characters and the tasks change based on the season. The game is shown from a third-person, almost-top down view with a fixed, isometric-like camera view and movement.</p>\n<p>Quests are often based on different types of items that can be collected. Characters can often turn items into something different, for instance turning fruit into jam, and resources can eventually be used to upgrade the town. Competing in the mini-games is rewarded with coins as a currency. Money can be spent at shops to buy and wear new clothing items. Later on blueprints can be used to improve stores and earn new types of rewards. Activities and mini-games include chopping wood to collect it as a resource, planting seeds and then watching trees and plants grow in later seasons, catching butterflies, fishing, snowball and water fights, collecting and handing out presents, collecting cards, a curling-like game, playing basketball, using a claw machine, making ice-cream, cleaning the school by vacuuming all the dust etc. Some mini-games are tied to specific seasons and these often take place in a separate screen or using a different viewpoint. For instance during spring cleaning in the elementary school you toss toys at helpers from a first-person perspective.</p>\n<p>The game supports multiplayer for up to four players in a separate game mode based on the different mini-games. Players can create a playlist of specific mini-games. A third option in the main menu called My House stores all collected items. The game is entirely controlled using the Wii Remote and the cursor is represented by a magic wand.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Babysitting Mama</em> is an entry in the <em>Mama</em> series where the player has to take care of a baby through different mini-games. The game comes optionally with a plush baby doll (also available separately) with a gap in the back where the Wii Remote can be inserted. The Wii Remote is then connected to the Nunchuck so the game recognizes movement of the doll combined with the analog stick and buttons of the Nunchuk for the main controls. It is also possible to play without the doll.</p>\n<p>The game progresses through many different mini-games such as taking pictures of the baby, feeding, washing, burping, rocking it to sleep, changing diapers, playing with a seesaw or a mobile, stopping it from crying etc. Each mini-game has a different lay-out and controls, often based on timing correctly with room for a few mistakes. Based on the final result a bronze, silver or gold medal is awarded. If the movement of the plush doll is too violent, the game pauses briefly and displays a warning. There are multiple environment such as inside the house or outside in the park. There are six babies to choose from, unlocked gradually: Daniel, Emma, Koyuki, Lucy, William and Yuto, each with their own baby book with six pages to unlock.</p>\n<p>Other types of mini-games include feeding multiple babies at once, a crawling race, pushing a swing, a simplified tug-of-war or collecting bottles. The mini-games can be practiced in a training mode and by completing them in the story mode various unlockables are opened up. The game is split up into several levels (pages) with four to five mini-games each. Some of the mini-games are based around mama when she has to swat flies or climb a tree to retrieve her hat. The game has a versus mode for two players simultaneously, each controlling their own doll. After completing the game it is possible to view an album with pictures of all of the baby's activities.</p>",

Players can choose between six pigs: Brutus, Ginger, Maximus, Norris, Randy and Rasher, only providing an aesthetic difference that does not affect abilities. There are three difficulty levels and the game is set in a farm environment.</p>\n<p>All events use a combination of the Wii Remote and sometimes the Nunchuk based on speed, stamina and timing to do well, for instance by moving the controller quickly or according to a certain rhythm to run, flicking it for a jump, or moving the Wii Remote in a circular motion for the hammer toss for instance. Next to single-player games against AI-controlled opponents, local multiplayer is supported for up to four players. In addition to single events there are group games and special games where more content can be unlocked, such as additional games or a development gallery.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon</em> is a game in the <em>Ghost Recon</em> series with gameplay very different from the other entries. Most of the other games are tactical shooters, while this one is a rail shooter where most of the movement is done automatically, so the player only has to point and shoot. After completing a section the soldiers generally move to a next position automatically and the camera, always showing the soldiers from a third-person perspective, cannot be controlled. The story describes how an ultranationalist faction within the Russian army staged a coup in Moscow and other major cities to take over the country. Since then they have expanded their control into Norway. Eighteen months later the Allied side starts a beach landing in Norway and attempts to move into Russia, which take up the game's 30 missions of the Campaign mode.</p>\n<p>Next to support for the Wii Zapper, the game is typically controlled with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. The Nunchuk is used to switch between aim and cover, and to change weapons. The Wii Remote is used to aim and shoot, and two buttons to change weapons and to switch between cover. Reloading is done by pointing off the screen and shooting. While running the Wii Remote can be shaken to slide into cover. While in a cover position the soldier cannot be hit, but cover fire also does not harm enemies. Effective fire can only be done while aiming and moving between covers, but at these moments the soldier is also vulnerable, making quick switching mandatory.</p>\n<p>There are three difficulty levels and the game is always played with two soldiers, Hibbard and Booth, working cooperatively. When not controlled by another player using the same screen, the computer's AI controls the second soldier and it is possible to leave or join at any moment. Next to the main Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 weapon they also have a limited amount of grenades and other weapons such as a pistol, an M50 or a bazooka can be found later on. Sometimes there are sections controlling a machine gun as a turret or a vehicle mounted gun. There are power-ups in the environment to restore health and also to activate slowed down bullet time for a short moment, making it easier to target and shoot.</p>\n<p>Next to the main campaign mode there is a competitive Arcade mode to get a highscore.</p>",

        "description": "<p>EA's FIFA Soccer series makes its debut on the Wii with <em>FIFA Soccer 08</em>. With graphics technology based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/79584/fifa-soccer-08/\">PS2/PC version</a>, the Wii version offers a unique control scheme, its own selection of modes, and several unique mini-games.</p>\n<p>The game includes the same licensed teams and players as other versions, with more than 570 teams and more than 14000 players available. Game modes include single matches, tournaments and challenges (asking players to recreate 61 feats from real matches). There is also online play and the interactive leagues mode known from other versions, in which players play their favorite team against other players online according to the real-life schedule. Manager mode and the new Be-A-Pro mode have not made it to the Wii version.</p>\n<p>Two different control options are available: the Family Play option (intended for beginners and families) uses only the Wiimote. The athletes move along the pitch automatically and the player's only task is to pass and shoot. The advanced controls use the Nunchuk for movement and the Wiimote for basic actions. Advanced moves require the combined use of both controllers, with much of the same depth as other versions: crosses, through passes and distance shots are possible. To learn the complexities of the advanced controls, a football academy mode is available from the main menu or, optionally, during a game, with new lessons appearing whenever they are needed.</p>\n<p>Footii Party mode is an exclusive mini-game mode hosted by a Mii avatar of Brazilian superstar Ronaldinho and played using players' Miis. The three available games are Juggling, Boot It and Table Football. Juggling is a rhythm game where buttons must be pressed or motions be made when indicated on the screen to keep the ball in the air. Boot It asks players to shoot at indicated points of the goal by swinging the remote in the proper direction. Table Football is a rendition of the popular real-life game, with the Wiimote used to simulate the table handles. The games can be played by up to four players, and a counter indicates the amount of calories burned during a session.</p>",

This makes the player go on a journey through five different worlds, each with its own distinct boss, while also featuring tons of different enemies. In addition, there is also a \"Bomberman for Beginners\" mode that welcomes newcomers to the series with basic tutorials to teach the traditional Bomberman mechanics.</p>\n<p>There are several new items relative to the Bomberman series, with some of them being activated through use of the Wii Remote\u2019s shaking feature, introducing a new element in the series. Players can also buy upgrades and power-ups, as well as use their Miis during gameplay.</p>\n<p>There is a WiiWare digital version that does not contain the story mode nor the beginner mode, as well as not allowing the player to purchase the extra items.</p>",

The four kids can with the help of special orbs and crystals transform into magical creatures called the Lords of Nature when stepping through a portal to the island of Gorm. Here they battle the evil lord Magmion and his fire Gormiti. While watching TV Razzle warns them about missing forest Gormiti on the island of Gorm. Without them the rivers stopped and the forest keeps burning. So the team is off to investigate.</p>\n<p>In the game you take control of either Jessica, the lord of air who has the ability to fly, Lucas, the lord of forest who controls the plants and trees, Nick, the lord of earth and able to smash rocks or Toby, the lord of sea that can bread underwater. You can switch freely between the four Lords of Nature during play. Along the way crystals and action points (used to cross obstacles) can be collected. As you try to solve the mystery you solve puzzles and battle the fire Gormiti. The game can be played solo or with a friend.</p>",

The kingdom's Wandoliers, which kept the kingdom in order, have all left or retired. It is up to you, the player, to rebuild buildings and structures all throughout the kingdom using scrolls that the characters give you. </p>\n<p>At the beginning of the game, you have the option to create and customize your own character. The player then must go to different islands and restore the buildings and structures there using essences. Each island has a different theme, and different tasks to accomplish. </p>\n<p>Once you finish a task, you earn King Points, which helps you unlock more islands. Once you reach King Points Level 5, you unlock Reward Island, where you can build as you please.</p>",

The game takes place in the world of Ecoia where everyone worships the Crystal Sun which shines its protecting light and energy over the kingdom of light. One day the kingdom is attacked by an evil queen of darkness that shatters the Crystal and fatally wounds the king. The adoptive son of the king (Ray) receives the magical crown of the kingdom from his dying father. His father tells Ray that he needs to gather the scattered pieces of the Crystal and restore it to its former glory. The crown grants Ray the help of the spirits Liad and Gush.</p>\n<p>The spirits Liad and Gush give the player the ability to spray several kinds of fluids like slime, water, vomit, and ice. These fluids can be used to kill enemies or get past obstacles. For example to get past fire the player has to spray water. Aside from the regular enemies there are also bosses.</p>",

They are first attacked by maintenance robots and become separated on the ship. The Doctor makes his way to the control room where a Cyber Leader has connected to the ship's A.I. and is threatening to kill the crew. Also, Cybermen attack Amy and chase her into outer space.  They also find Daleks who are after a Time Axis. </p>\n<p>Controlling the Doctor and Amy in turn, there are different colored crystals to collect from robot dispensers. But you must use stealth by crouching behind objects and sneak up on them to avoid their cone of view.  The crystals have different purposes: red ones are used to avoid hazards, purple ones can fix things, and green ones open doors. A floating colored icon must be shot in first-person view with the same colored crystal to get by it. At the end of most sections, there's a mini-game where you roll a photonic ball of energy through a circuit without hitting obstacles or touching the sides. The game came with a Sonic Screwdriver Wii remote cover.</p>",

Collect slices of pie and pic-a-nic baskets for points and bonuses. </p>\n<p>Ranger Smith is on the lookout, so don't disturb animals and visitors in the park. Yogi is helped by his sidekick Boo Boo, to get through difficult areas. He'll also take photos of endangered animals to help save the park.

They must complete a series of challenges while the Grandmaster moves them around his board game. </p>\n<p>Up to four players can fight against the Grandmaster and his band of villains: Dr. Doom, Juggernaut, Lizardman, and Red Skull. Make your way through the level to destroy a large blue orb at the center to break the dome that entraps them and gain their freedom. Collect orbs along the way to move further forward and increase your damage power. Landing on a blue block on the board will send you to one of three locations and you must perform different attack or dodge moves on the way. A villain challenge block will have you fight a villain and if you are defeated you will go to a jail and can only be freed if your fellow players attack it. A yellow block controls a wall around the map that can knock a hero off the map. The Grandmaster can teleport you to another part of the board.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Tiki Towers</em> for the Wii is based on the same concept as the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tiki+Towers\">mobile game</a> with the same name but has several differences. Most notable is that the game uses three dimensional graphics and it has different levels which generally are larger than in the mobile version. There are also some differences in the game mechanics. Here the monkeys are actively constructing the tower and not just climbing across it when it's finished. Other differences include spells that can be cast and special levels against enemy chiefs. To cast spells the player needs BananaMana which monkeys have to chant or collect bananas for. Enemy chiefs have their own spells that they use to thwart the player's progress.</p>\n<p>The Wii version also features a local multiplayer mode where two players cooperate.</p>",

A quick game for in-between is offered by the second mode where songs that have been unlocked by overcoming the career mode are offered even for a multiplayer match against or in cooperation with a friend.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>ExerBeat</em> is a rhythm-based fitness game in which the player must mirror the moves of the in-game instructors. There is a total of 155 exercises, covering 8 categories: Aerobics, Hip Hop, Latin Dance, Boxercising, Karate, Karate Forms, Yoga/Pilates, and Stretching. </p>\n<p>During the exercises, the arrows that appear on screen represent the workout moves to make. The player's accuracy in reproducing the moves is rated as OK, Close, or Miss, with Rhythm Points only awarded for the first one. At the end of an exercise, the results screen will list the Rhythm Points, Longest Combo, Success Rate, Ranking, and will potentially award a Bronze, Silver or Gold medal.</p>\n<p>The player is also given the option to create their own personal program based on their workout goals, trouble areas, and workout time.</p>\n<p>On top of the exercises themselves, the game provides an \"Around The World\" mode where the time and Rhythm Points of the workouts are translated into miles. Those miles allow the player's Mii to travel across the world and visit successive cities and landmarks. </p>\n<p>The game also includes a set of mini-games that are not strictly related to fitness training: Swimming, Dance Fever, Pizza Toss, Wall Smasher, and Pirate Attack.</p>\n<p>Up to two players can exercise alongside each other, each using either a single or two Wii Remotes. The Pirate Attack game requires a Wii Remote Plus or Wii MotionPlus accessory. The Latin Dance exercises support an optional Wii Balance Board.</p>",

Tutorial mode is a target practice mode, where players shoot barrels, crates, jars, pots and other objects. Story mode is the main game. Wanted is a boss rush mode and Two Player is two player mode.</p>\n<p>Story mode contains four chapters each broken up in three parts, the chapters are Ranch, Indian Village, Canyon and Western Town. The levels contain typical wild west settings: a barn, a bank, a railroad station, gold mines. In some levels the player is riding on horseback or in a mine cart on rails. There is a double barrel power-up and in some levels the player gets a gatling gun. Throughout the levels there are cows and horses confined by a small wooden fence, shoot the fence to free the animals for bonus points. At certain points in the level, two or more arrows will appear on screen and the player can choose a path by shooting an arrow.</p>\n<p>The game had a cartoonish wild west theme and it is generally aimed at children. When enemies are shot they just disappear with a dust cloud and leave a white surrender flag. There are some culturally insensitive depictions of native Americans, featuring cartoonishly big noses and war cries.</p>",

Players take the role of Pole the cowboy as he sets out through different 2D platformer stereotype levels to rescue his kidnapped girlfriend, armed with his trusty pistol to shoot enemies from a distance. Each level is littered with weird and surprising gags for players to discover, narrated out loud by a tsukkomi comedian, making the gameplay at least as much about discovering all of the weird things there are to be found as about the actual platforming.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Evasive Space</em> is a 3D action game where the female character Konki's ship needs to be guided through cramped, maze-like environments to fulfil objectives. She is a Stellar Guardian and must regain the Constellation Stones from Dr. Dark Matter and his band of space thieves. Shown using a side view, the game uses an unusual control mechanic: a single button is used to fire the thrusters, while the Wii Remote infrared pointer steers the ship by moving a cursor across the screen. That way the controls are not very precise and a quick succession of thrust and moving the cursor is needed to avoid obstacles. Risks are also encourages as the farther the cursor is removed from the ship, the faster it will travel. The speed of control is also encouraged through the time limit imposed in most missions.</p>\n<p>When the ship hits an obstacle or a wall it is stunned briefly and some energy is removed. The ship needs to collect energy cells to restore power and this can be used to charge a system of up three panels of power. Picking up chronosphere items briefly rewinds time to win a few seconds. There are also diodes that can be collected fill and upgrade meter and unlock six different ship upgrades, including an energy shield that protects against damage. Obstacles include crystalline shards, enemy missiles, turrets, black holes and more. There are twenty missions set across four worlds.</p>\n<p>Offline multiplayer is supported for up to four people through six game modes. Through the WiFi connection players can compete for the fastest times on the online leaderboards.</p>",

Players have a playfield with space for seven hands of poker, three of which start with cards in them. Using the gamepad or a Wii remote, players can swap cards on the playfield with each other. Players can point at cards containing scoring sets of cards via standard poker rules, and those cards will be eliminated. Over time, new hands appear from the bottom of the screen, and the player loses if the screen overflows. In the multiplayer mode, two players compete head to head to see who can last the longest.</p>",
