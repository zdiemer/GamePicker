You are armed with 5 anti-atherosclerosis projectiles and must clear a total of 27 arterial blockages. Power-ups are available to aid your progress and you will also encounter viruses, out to hinder you.</p>\n<p><em>Nextoid!</em> is a homage to the 80's arcade classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Arkanoid\">Arkanoid</a>. It is a bat-and-ball game, designed to test your reflexes. You must move your bat along a horizontal plain at the bottom of the screen and deflect a bouncing ball onto the coloured blocks above, destroying them one by one until the level is cleared. If you miss the ball, your ship will be destroyed and you lose a life. Some blocks will release collectible power-ups, which may or may not be useful. Helpful power-ups include giving your bat additional laser fire, extending it, slowing down the ball, etc. Unhelpful power-ups include shrinking the bat, speeding-up the ball etc. You will also be hindered by 'viruses' that aim to get in the way of the ball's path and deflect it back at you.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>DeltaStar: Earth Defence</em> the player gets to pilot the top-secret starfighter 'Project DeltaStar' and fight the invading insect-like aliens. This game is a derivative of classic 80's single-screen vertical shooters such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Galaxians\">Galaxians</a>. The gameplay is set in a single screen, with your ship's movement limited to a fixed horizontal plane at the bottom of the screen. The banks of enemies above you move in a grouped horizontal formation, firing down at you. Some ships will split from the flock and dive bomb you whilst firing at ever closer range, forcing you to avoid a collision as well as the bullets. </p>\n<p>The game is divided into 'systems', with each containing several attack waves, including dodging asteroids and an end of level boss. Each wave must be cleared before the next appears. You start with a basic single shot weapon, which can be upgraded to more powerful weapons such as double shot, fireballs, and deflector shield, by collecting the descending power-up tokens. Shooting at the token changes which weapon will be collected.</p>\n<p>The game ends when you have cleared all 9 systems.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Angry Bloaters</em> you play as Old John, who must destroy the deadly Bloaters with his infinite supply of bombs.</p>\n<p>This game is a homage of the 1983 <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Hudson+Soft\">Hudson Soft</a> title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/72718/eric-and-the-floaters/\">Eric and the Floaters</a> with additional power-ups more commonly found in later versions of the game.</p>\n<p>To complete each stage, all enemies must be destroyed by blowing them up with a timed bomb. The Bloaters tend to roam the maze but will change colour from green to red at certain intervals and pursue you around the maze. You can either try to destroy them for additional points or hide until they return to their more placid state. Like the original version, your bombs cannot trap either yourself or the enemies. You can blow up walls to collect treasure (to boost score) and gain power-ups such as shoes (to increase speed) and bombs with extra range.</p>\n<p>On every fourth stage, auto-bombing is enabled, forcing you to keep moving or risk being blown up where you stand. On some stages, you can wrap around to the other side of the screen,<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a>-style.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dweebs Drop</em> is a match-three arcade puzzle game, whereby coloured 'Dweebs' fall from the top of the screen and must be matched with three or more of the same colour in order to clear that line. Matching four in a square pattern will create a 'super Dweeb' which will gain extra points when destroyed by a fifth. Hitting black a black Dweeb will add a line to your opponent and hitting a coloured egg will destroy clear everything of that colour. There are three game modes - 1P against Schnoodle the dog (CPU), 2P, and alternatively playing as gems instead of Dweebs. The game has only one screen and one level, so once you have defeated an opponent, the game carries on for you until lose your own life.</p>",

Two holes will appear horizontally and vertically either side of the orb seed and walking into a hole will end the game. Going back to an orb seed, however, will generate four power orbs and fill in the void holes. Collecting power orbs will increase your score but if you get stuck, you must spend four of those points to remove the surrounding void. The game is designed to be unwinnable and to challenge yourself at a high score.</p>\n<p>The author cites the inspiration for this game to be the 1982 magazine type-in game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Magic+Dollar+Seeds\">Magic Dollar Seeds</a> for the Sinclair ZX81 and it was submitted to the 2018 ToeJam competition.</p>",

Your task is to fit falling tetrominoes together to form a complete line which will then destroy that line. If complete lines are not formed, the tetromino pieces will stack up and reach the top of the playing area, ending the game.</p>\n<p>This version features three game modes (world tour, endless, and challenge). In World Tour, the player must navigate 20 consecutive levels with a city-themed background, as opposed to Endless mode which allows you to choose your start level and isn't location themed. In challenge mode, solid blocks are placed in the playing area and the player must navigate around them and try to destroy them by including them in a complete tetromino line.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The intrepid explorer 'Baggers' is searching for valuable planetary assets but he, unfortunately, keeps crash-landing onto the planets he is visiting. Help him to rebuild his rocket so he can continue his journey.</p>\n<p><em>Baggers in Space</em> is a 2D platform adventure game that is heavily influenced by the 1983 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Jetpac\">Jetpac</a> as well as elements from the 1984 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=H.E.R.O.\">H.E.R.O.</a> You must fly around on your jetpack, collecting three parts of your rocket, whilst defending yourself from enemies with your laser. Once the rocket is reassembled, you are then given dynamite, which you must use to open up the caverns below and to blast through walls in order to search for the rocket's three fuel cells. Some inaccessible areas can only be unlocked with a key. As well as a health meter, you also have an air meter which steadily declines as time progresses but both can be replenished by pick-ups underground. The quicker you finish the level, the more bonus points will be awarded. There are also idols to collect which grant you a bonus or power-up which is unique to that planet. There are 16 themed worlds to explore, each with their own inhabitants and traps.</p>",

This is a maze/arena game where you have to collect all the crystals before the countdown timer runs out whilst avoiding contact with the enemies. Some enemies can be temporarily stunned with your laser, whilst others are impervious. Some enemies will chase you if you get too close. You can use your boost to move around the screen quicker but at the cost of some control, so use wisely. There are eight different ship designs to choose from. The best way to play the game is to figure out the pattern of the enemies and plot the most efficient route, as bonus points are awarded depending on how quickly you complete each arena.</p>",

Like the original, it is a scrolling vertical shooter, whereby you fight waves of enemy ships whilst dodging indestructible asteroids. Bonus points are rewarded at the end of the level for destroying all parts of the ground base. This version also retains the depleting damage meter and power-ups that increase speed and firepower. Unlike the original, there are now end-of-level mini-bosses to defeat, additional enemy types and patterns, and 20 levels instead of 10.

Unlike the previous platform and shooting games, this is described as a digital comic, which is designed more like a graphical text adventure. However, rather than typing a verb-noun command into a text parser, you are presented with a HUD which shows the available actions for that screen and you just press the corresponding letter key. The keys are N (North), S (south), E (east), W (West), L (Look), I (Item) and T (Talk). Actions will be greyed out if unavailable for that location. </p>\n<p>The gameplay involves you travelling around the map and conversing with the characters in each location. They all require you do them a fetch them items in exchange for information that will lead you to Lady Mandrill. The dialogue style is comedic and mildly adult in places.</p>",

This is a puzzle platform game. Each of the 100 levels is presented as a single screen, whereby you must collect all the flowers on that screen before advancing to the next level. You must plan your route around the screen as it is easy to get trapped and you can't reverse your steps. There are stone blocks that can either be pushed out of the way (as long there are no blocks on either side or below), or broken up via your 'plasma slicer', although you can only destroy the stone below you and this action can't be undone. There are also spiked blocks that will kill you if touched. Some levels require switches to be activated to open doors and close floor traps. The enemies can kill you with one touch and can't be destroyed themselves. You are given one life and no energy bar.</p>",

You must keep jumping on the cubes to change them to the target colour. Every block in the pyramid must be changed in order to complete the level. Each level requires a different strategy, for example, you may have to jump on the cubes twice to change them to the desired colour or the block may revert back to its original colour if you jump on it a second time. The enemies will kill you with one touch but you can avoid them either by jumping on the warp discs (which returns you back to the top of the screen) or by using a limited supply of smart bombs which kills all enemies on screen. Some enemies will follow their own pattern whereas others will chase after you. Some enemies will reverse the changes you've made, although you will be awarded points if you chase and catch them. There are 36 stages divided into 9 Levels of 4 rounds each.</p>",

As the game progresses, the terrain graphics change to indicate a new level - each level also has a variety of attacking aliens (from horizontal missile attacks, zig-zagging saucers and bouncing aliens) and the frequency of various elements on the terrain change (i.e. less fuel tanks, more missiles, etc) to make it harder.</p>\n<p>The program is free, and its code and graphics can be edited/modified or just used to learn from.</p>",

All the pictures are of well known recent political leaders. You start with a blank play area and must bring new pieces into play. They will continue to slide across the area until they hit another piece, so you must push other blocks in their path to stop them where you want them. There are doors along the edge of the play area where you can eject pieces (deliberately or accidentally) and repellents which will send the tile back from where it came from. Not all tiles are related to the picture (rockets, diamonds, bombs, etc. ) and these items can be matched for bonus points or ejected. The bomb will explode and you will lose a life if not ejected quickly or doused with a water tile if available. Each puzzle must be completed within a set time limit and you are given three lives.</p>",

The aim of the game is to use your digger to plough through the dirt of the caverns, collecting treasures such as gems, flowers etc., whilst avoiding the monsters that guard them. The enemies can only move within the cleared areas, for which you have to be careful not to clear a path to you. </p>\n<p>Unlike <em>Digger</em> (and more like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Boulder+Dash\">Boulder Dash)</a>, this remake removes the ability to use weapons to defend yourself and you must rely on either avoidance or clearing dirt under an object (such as a boulder) that can be used to crush enemies if they are directly below you. However, unlike Boulder Dash (and similar games), you can't indefinitely stay underneath a boulder (or other gravity affected object) until you move, and you will be killed by it yourself if you don't move straight away. You also can't push an object into the path of an enemy. This remake also introduces additional features as the levels progress, such as doors to unlock, force fields, booby traps and tunnels.</p>\n<p>A level is cleared once all items on the screen are collected. There are 100 levels for you to navigate, with the ultimate goal to hunt down the 'golden idol'. You are given three lives per game and can restart from where you died.</p>",
