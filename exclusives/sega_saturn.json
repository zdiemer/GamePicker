        "description": "<p>Edge is one of the soldiers in the service of the mighty Empire. The Empire has recently ordered some excavations at ancient ruins, trying to discover the secret of an old technology that is much superior to that of present time. During the excavation works, Edge encounters a mysterious young girl. He then witnesses the murder of his captain and other soldiers by Crayden, one of the Empire's officers. Coming into contact with an ancient dragon, Edge begins to roam the world, determined to find Crayden and avenge the death of his comrades. Nobody helps him but his faithful dragon. But the Empire is also after Crayden, so there appear to be at least three sides in the conflict - or are there more?</p>\n<p><em>Panzer Dragoon Saga</em> is set in the same universe as the other <em>Panzer Dragoon</em> games, but differs from the rest of the series by being a role-playing game with elements of a shooter. There is no party in the game: the player only controls Edge on the back of his dragon, who is in fact the playable character in battles. Edge moves around through the game's fully 3D world by riding the dragon. In towns and some dungeons Edge can also move on foot. During battles, the player can either choose to shoot with Edge's gun, or use one of the many special attacks of the dragons. </p>\n<p>The battles do not work exactly like in an action game, but occur in real time: the player has to quickly choose an ability to use, and also move around to attack enemies from the sides or from the back, at the same time trying to avoid their attacks. The dragon receives experience points for fighting and also gains levels. The player is able to customize the dragon by assigning to him one of the four available dragon classes, that will determine his attack power, speed, etc.</p>",

Then there is Claris Sinclair, she loves to sing, but when she step on the stage, she felt so nervous that she ran out to the exit like a coward.  </p>\n<p>NiGHTS was a first class Maren together with Reala.  They were both created by Wizeman.  As day pass by, NiGHTS notice how his master becoming so evil.  So when he started to refuse on obeying his master's evil deeds, Wizeman punished him by locking him up into an Ideya Palaces.</p>\n<p>But NiGHTS found out that he has a chance to escape his prison by combining his body to a human dreamer.  Those dreamers were Elliot and Claris.  He also found out that those two have a Red Ideya within them.  As he finally free himself out of the Ideya Palace, he will find Wizeman and destroy him with the help of Elliot and Claris. </p>\n<p>Here you basically control Elliot, Claris and Nights. You start a level by choosing Elliot and Claris. Gameplay is similar to Sonic but unique in a way that it is best to use the special D-pad. As you fly through the levels you should pass through a certain number of loop rings to finish each level. You gain bonuses by dancing which can be easily achieved by using a D-pad.</p>",

You play the role of a young swordsman Arthur, who decided to work as a mercenary for various people needing his services. On his first mission, the King of Enrich sends him to a mine, in order to find and punish a renegade ninja who has escaped from him. However, an accident occurs that makes Arthur realize that he'll have to do much more than his usual mercenary assignment, and that there is a true evil in the world that must be defeated at all costs.</p>\n<p>The game features 3D graphics and utilizes first-person perspective for dungeons and battles. The turn-based battles are of a traditional Japanese RPG kind, except the addition of \"Pixie System\". In various places in the game you can find pixies who can later be used as allies in battles.</p>",

These additions also hint at some of the plot twists in the game's sequel <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/2962/battle-arena-toshinden-2/\">Battle Arena Toshinden 2</a>.</p>\n<p>The games graphics took a huge hit in the port; the Playstation version really does look considerably better. Though the character model and arena for the afore mentioned port exclusive character looks notably better than the ported graphics.</p>\n<p>Toshinden Remix also redubs all the games voice samples with more light-hearted samples with over the top and arguably outrageous accents.</p>\n<p>Like the graphics, the game speed also takes a huge hit in this port running considerably slower than the Playstation original.</p>",

It abandons the plot of the original <em>Toshinden</em>/<em>Toshinden Remix</em> and tells a new standalone tale revolving around the assassination of renowned warriors all over the world.</p>\n<p>The game adds three new fighters compared to its predecessor; RonRon, Ripper and Tracy and three new bosses and secret characters bringing the total number of fighters to 15. The original <em>Toshinden</em>\u2019s final boss and also <em>Remix</em>\u2019s exclusive character have been removed. The gameplay could be described as a hybrid of the Playstation\u2019s <em>Toshinden</em> and <em>Toshinden 2</em> with movement like the former but the latter\u2019s combo system.</p>",

In order to gain the power of the six Spirits, Leon must descend into the Spirits' dungeons. </p>\n<p><em>The Legend of Oasis</em> is the prequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6877/beyond-oasis/\"> Beyond Oasis</a>, also known as <em>The Story of Thor</em>. Like its predecessor, it is an action game with role-playing elements. The gameplay is quite similar to that of <em>Beyond Oasis</em>. Leon can attack with melee weapons or use a bow for long-ranged attack. His armlet also allows him to summon spirits, who would damage the enemy or heal Leon. Instead of the usual experience points system the game features \"ranks\" (equivalent to levels); higher ranks increase the protagonist's hit points and can be gained by recovering his health multiple times.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Set in a world of fantasy and magic, Shining Force III places you in the boots of a young general, fighting to preserve the peace in your world. The story starts out as the Emperor is abducted from within the city of Saraband, and you must go on the run with your king, who is suspected of being the mastermind behind the abduction. Of course, things are not as they seem, and you will be taken through a web of lies and deceit in your quest to prove the King innocent.</p>\n<p>The game is very similar in style to the earlier Shining Force titles, so anyone who's played them will be comfortable with the game, though likely they'll also be happy to find the game graphically overhauled, with a 3-D landscape and 3D characters during the battle animations. As ever the main game is controlled like a traditional RPG, with you controlling the main character, talking to NPC's and searching various items. However, the main selling point of the Shining Force series has always been its battle sequences. </p>\n<p>The combat system is amended from the earlier titles, with a new and unique \"friendship\" system, whereby the more two characters work together (helping each other out, healing each other etc.) the closer they bond, and they will start to give each other bonuses on the battlefield. Other traditional features, such as the rock-paper-scissors nature of the weapons (sword beats axe, axe beats spear, spear beats sword etc.) and the terrain effects (someone hiding in a forest is going to get better protection than someone on an open road) remain fully intact, and anyone who's played the earlier titles in the series will likely be very comfortable with the combat system.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that this is actually the western conversion of Shining Force III: Episode I, and was therefore only the first episode in an intended series of three. Unfortunately the other two titles were never released outside of Japan, so most western gamers were only able to experience a third of the storyline.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Iron Storm</em> is a traditional turn-based strategy game. The original Japanese release was the second entry in Sega's Advanced Daisenryaku series, with gameplay very similar to that of it's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/44860/advanced-daisenryaku-doitsu-dengeki-sakusen/\">16-bit predecessor</a>, changing some details and using 3D animations for the combat cutscenes. The game uses a hex-based map and features fog-of-war, weather, unit experience, unit upgrading, supply, and other common strategy wargame features.</p>\n<p>Unlike the previous game, three campaigns are available instead of one. Japanese, as well as United States forces can be commanded now in addition to German units. The scenarios that are played during a campaign can change depending on the battle results - a successful player may invade North America for example. There are also ten scenarios with pre-set forces separately available for selection in Standard Mode, during which the control of all involved armies can be switched to a human player.</p>",

            }
        ],
        "description": "<p>The Legend of Eldean tells of a trio of powerful magic-wielding siblings from the ancient kingdom of Fargasta: Radoria, Estan and their sister Cirrus. As they and their powers grew, the Black Dragon Vlag, hungry to devour this power and make it his own, began a campaign of assault against the siblings and their kingdom. Together, the Eldean clan was able to defeat Vlag, and with the killing strike were showered in his vile blood and imbibed with immortality. Fargasta ascended into a prosperous age under the leadership of their fabled heroes, but this period of revelry was soon cut short as Radoria began to descend into a madness that stemmed from his claiming of the foul sword Madriker, crafted from the soul of the vanquished Black Dragon. As his madness, and power, grew, he claimed the title of \"Immortal Emperor\" and set about imposing his will upon the lands, destroying all that was pure and crushing any who opposed him and his fiend-sword Madriker. The black tide that had swallowed his soul soon threatened to swallow everything. In a final act of desperation, Cirrus called upon the one power she had hidden from her brothers and transformed herself into the Holy Sword of Eldean, equipping to Estan and allowing him to cast a mighty blow towards Radoria, causing a blast that sent tremors throughout the lands entire. As the dust settled on the battleground, there was to be no trace of any of the Eldean clan; all had vanished, and all the people believed the Legend of Eldean had come to its tragic conclusion.</p>\n<p>Generations of relative peace passed following the fateful battle between the Eldean siblings, but with time the ancient truces that united the land during Radoria's scourge began to unravel. War and unrest began to take root, new agents of evil began to take power and the violence spread out to all corners of the world. Pike, a young boy whose parents were murdered at the outset of this new unrest, while he was still just an infant, awakes one morning in his home in the Harpy Village, where he was taken by Laia, the harpy that found him after his parents' demise. The Harpy Village had managed to remain isolated from the troubles brewing elsewhere until this morning, when it is attacked by a dark, dragon-mounted warrior named Belnard on a ruinous quest to collect all the Power Crystals in the land, one of which is housed in the Harpy Village. During the attack, Laia is petrified by Belnard, forcing Pike to gather his courage and venture forth from the Village. Armed with his father's old magical, talking sword, Cirrus, Pike sets out on a quest to save Laia and all that he holds dear; soon taking up allies that join him on his quest to stop the evil Belnard and the dark forces he works for from conquering the world.</p>\n<p>Players assume the role of Pike as he travels the land, gaining 4 comrades to help in his quest, fighting menu-driven battles and exploring towns and dungeons. The player controls their inventory and party by use of items and magic, equipping of weapons and armor and monitoring the status of party characters. While traveling from town to town or exploring dungeons, the player will be engaged in random encounters by enemies unseen on the screen or overworld. Each character's agility skill determines the order of turns during combat. Battles reach their conclusion when either all of the enemies or all of Pike's party have been depleted of their hit points. Winning a battle nets the player experience points, gold and occasionally an item. Running from a battle is also an option, though this results in nothing gained. If all of the player's party is slain during the battle, the game will be over. The player will come across shops selling items and equipment in each town they come across, at which the player can use gold earned from winning battles or selling outdated equipment to purchase new wares. Magic and skills play a large role in battles, with characters calling upon their stores of MP to utilize them in lieu of standard attacks during battle.</p>\n<p>Albert Odyssey: Legend of Eldean is a standard Japanese-style Turn-Based RPG. Though released on the 32-bit Sega Saturn, it is visually reminiscent of other classic top-down 16-bit SNES RPGs. The extra graphical horsepower is used to make things just a bit crisper, clearer and more vibrant than its predecessors. It also utilizes its fifth-generation capabilities in the form of CD-quality audio for the thoroughly composed soundtrack, and the occasional voiceover, most prominently in the opening intro. Players will take their party of 5 characters through several cities and dungeons, traversing to and from each on a minimal overworld map rife with random encounters. Each character gains experience and levels up independently, with stats gained and spells learned automatically with progression. Combat occurs in typical Turn-Based fashion, with options for each character to attack, use magic, use an item, defend or run. Though power-leveling is easy due to the frequent random encounters, it is not greatly needed thanks to the abundance of boss battles and the high amount of experience gained from winning each one. Through the majority of the game, the highest-caliber weapons and armor are bought from the cities' shops, but the most powerful of these items are found in longer, more complex endgame dungeons. The game is split into 2 chapters, the 2nd taking place a few years after the 1st and building upon a plot thread started in it. </p>\n<p>Legend of Eldean is part of the Albert Odyssey series, with 2 previous Japan-only releases on SNES, although there is no continuation of storyline established in the first 2 Albert Odyssey's in Legend of Eldean, save for a few reference to Albert, the main character of the original, and some of his exploits. Legend of Eldean also differs from the previous entries through its Turn-Based combat, where the first 2 employed a Tactical style. It is not fully known to what extent the translation team at Working Designs stuck to the original Japanese script. Their conversion brings with it many pop-culture references (some timeless, some definitely rooted in the time of release), 4th wall-breaking allusions and humorous punchlines and non-sequiturs; mostly through the brief interactions the player can engage in with NPC townsfolk, but even interjected into the more plot-crucial conversations and events taking place with the fairly large cast of important characters involved, breaking mold with what would have been an otherwise standard fantasy-fare storyline and setting.</p>",

In order to defeat Madruk, Astea created a powerful dragon, who eventually emerged victorious and was able to seal Madruk away.</p>\n<p>Years have passed. Legendra is now divided into eight kingdoms. One of them, Fandaria, is ruled by a monarch named Goldark. The other kings have heard rumors that Goldark is planning to take over Legendra by conquering all the other kingdoms. Everyone is preparing for the war, without realizing that the ancient evil is about to raise its head once again...</p>\n<p><em>Dragon Force</em> is a real-time strategy game (RTS). The player can choose one of the six monarchs (plus two additional ones that become available once the game is completed) with their unique scenarios. The gameplay is divided into three modes: management, overworld movement, and battle. Management mode allows the player to assign generals, decide the fate of prisoners, prepare the army for battles, etc. Navigation on the map is done in real time; once two warring armies have reached the same spot, the player is taken to a separate battle screen. The battles also evolve in real time, the goal usually being killing or capturing enemy general. If all the soldiers are killed, the two generals can opt for a duel that will decide the outcome of the battle.</p>\n<p>Each kingdom has unique \"strong\" fighter types, which the player should use to target the weaknesses of the opposing armies. Each fighter type also has his own special techniques and abilities.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The second <em>Panzer Dragoon</em> game is not a sequel, but a prequel to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/2897/panzer-dragoon/\">first</a>, and is also set in a post-apocalyptic world where mankind struggles against forces of nature, trying to re-build their civilization.</p>\n<p>The game follows the story of a boy named Lundi who lives in a frontier town. The area is populated by mutant animals called \"khourieats\". The town inhabitants see them as bad omens and kill them. One day Lundi finds a small khourieat with wings. Instead of killing it, Lundi decides to hide it and keep it as a pet. After his town was destroyed by an ancient weapon, Lundi sets out on a long journey with his pet, who will soon become a powerful dragon.</p>\n<p>Like the first game, <em>Panzer Dragoon Zwei</em> is a rail-shooter. The player follows a pre-set course and either uses Lundi's gun or the dragon's special abilities to dispose of the enemies. Lagi (that is the name of the dragon) can evolve during the game and gain more powerful attacks, which signifies a step towards a real RPG like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7436/panzer-dragoon-saga/\"> Panzer Dragoon Saga</a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Several years after the events described in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7027/shining-force-ii/\">Shining Force II</a>, an orphan named Mars begins his work as a guard in the Odegon castle. One night, a strange fog descends upon the land, and Mars witnesses a mysterious elf entering the Ancient Shrine. Through a series of events and lies on his part, Mars becomes the elite guard of the princess, and soon has to redeem himself by stopping the dark elf Pazort from destroying the world.</p>\n<p><em>Shining Wisdom</em> is the fourth game in the Shining series, but is completely different from the others. Neither a turn-based dungeon crawl like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7005/shining-in-the-darkness/\">Shining in the Darkness</a>, or a tactical RPG like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6819/shining-force/\">Shining Force</a>, the game plays very similarly to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Zelda\">Zelda</a> with its overhead exploration, action combat and occasional puzzle-solving. RPG elements are very light; the protagonist's health can be increased by finding HP bubbles, but there is no experience system of any kind. The game proceeds by collecting various items found in dungeons and then combining them with magical orbs to create different spell effects that can be used to tackle enemies and solve the riddles that must be bested to beat each labyrinth.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Clockwork Knight</em> is a game that depicts the sometimes friendly, sometimes combative, secret lives of toys. Betsy has a huge number of toys that come to life in the absence of humans and normally play nicely with each other. In the opening introduction, the somewhat inept clockwork knight Pepperouchau is competing with some other knights for the affections of a princess who lives in the clock. Everyone is having a grand time until a rogue toy shows up through the air vent, absconds with the princess, and turns many of the other toys against Pepperouchau.</p>\n<p>The gameplay consists of side scrolling action through various stages constructed of elaborate series of toys, traps, and common household items. The first stage is a quest through Betsy's room with lots of letter blocks, sharp crayons, and dollhouses precariously balanced on robots that tend to fall on you. Pepperouchau is armed with a key sword that has offensive use as well as the ability to open boxes that functions as warps to other areas. The second stage takes place in Betsy's brother's room. Kevin has a lot of engineering skill and has built an impressive network of cranes and trains that Pepperouchau will need to activate in order to clear the area. Watch out for the jet transformer boss at the end of the room.</p>\n<p>Other stages include missions through other areas of the house including the kitchen and the attic. Throughout the game you also collect coins. 20 coins are worth a continue when you run out of lives. Further, you meet other friendly toys between levels who give you the opportunity to gamble with your earned coins.</p>",

A new Angel appears and attacks Unit-01. As a result, Shinji loses his memory. His friends decide he should fight Asuka in Unit-02, hoping his memory will be restored as a result of the battles.</p>\n<p>The game contains many cut-scenes made by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Gainax\">Gainax</a>, the creators of the TV series. Many scenes are taken directly from original <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> episodes. The player gains control when they have to make decisions for Shinji (choose correct answers, etc.), and when fighting Angels. The player should figure out which attack the Angel is using, and press corresponding buttons to defend and to counterattack it.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This is the second <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> \"interactive anim\u00e9\" for Saturn. The events of the game take place just after Episode 14 of the TV series. A new girl called Magumi arrives to the school where the hero of the series Shinji Ikari studies. The two start developing feelings for each other, when a new Angel attacks. The player controls Shinji through series of decisions (there are now three or four choices each time, as opposed to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Shinseiki+Evangelion\">the prior game</a> that had only two, and a branching story line) and through the fights. Much of the movie footage depicting combat is presented in 3D. The player selects moves from time to time; correct selections lead to the continuation of the movie - and hence, the game.</p>",

The game follows the story of an aspiring knight (default name Henry), who is framed for a crime and is about to be executed. However, the beautiful princess of the country feels mercy and stops the execution at the last moment. As the hero tries to uncover the truth about his conviction, fate brings the two together, and they begin a journey to discover distant lands in search for adventure, and perhaps even develop feelings for each other...</p>\n<p>The game's combat is a rather simple version of the traditional Japanese-style RPG system. The player controls a party that contains only Henry and the princess. Whenever enemies are encountered, a separate battle screen appears. Commands are executed via a standard menu, allowing physical attacks, defense, as well as offensive and supporting magic spells. Graphically, <em>Airs Adventure</em> combines pre-rendered character sprites with partially polygonal backgrounds, with an over-the-shoulder view.</p>",

The first Daytona on the Saturn boasted some hefty visuals, great for displaying the Saturn's power to the masses at the console's birth; but for the Saturn to be revered for everything it was, Sega (and AM2) had to make something a little flashier.  All the graphics in the game have been updated...both the cars and tracks have higher polygon count, better texture mapping; the framerate is QUITE noticeably improved, everything is very smooth.</p>",

The missions, set in different weathers and at different times of day, usually have specific objectives, be they search and destroy, protecting allies or killing everything. Four weapons are available: the main cannon; a weak machine gun that overheats with prolonged use; clusters of grenades and limited supplies of homing missiles. Damage repair and extra ammo is available from supply helicopters, but these are vulnerable to attack. Ally mechs can be useful, but it is the player who has to do most of the work by far, battling mechs that are sometimes faster and more agile, therefore a certain amount of strategy and planning is required.</p>",

        "description": "<p>It is the 22nd century. Human beings have long reached outer space and traveled to other planets. But they could not find happiness, and soon their only source of feelings became the \"Cyber Net\", a virtual world where people could experience simple emotions such as love or hatred. One day, a deadly virus was discovered in the Cyber Net. A special unit called Blue Metal was sent to annihilate the virus. But something went wrong, and the members of the unit were killed. Serge Shadix survived, but his brother Leon never came back. This accident made Serge join a force called STAND (Special Team for Alert to Network Destruction), which specialized in cybernetic crimes. Will Serge be able to solve the mystery and discover the secret of the virus?</p>\n<p><em>Virus</em> is an adventure game with elements of a shooter, similar in concept to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7524/snatcher/\">Snatcher</a>, but with much more developed and frequent combat. During the adventure portions of the game, the player views locations and talks to characters from first-person perspective, interacting with the environment by selecting command icons from a bar on the bottom of the screen, and then moving the cursor on the screen to select the object to interact with in a point-and-click fashion. The game has many more puzzles than most other Japanese-style adventures; most of them are logic- or memory-based, though a few require the player to explore the environment and use inventory items.</p>\n<p>The protagonist often enters and explores first-person 3D dungeon-like areas, where he can physically move around and also encounter enemies. Battles take place on a separate screen; the hero fights by aiming at enemies and shooting at them in real time. Each action in combat costs action points (AP); once the main character's AP bar is depleted, he cannot perform actions until it refills gradually or until the player uses an AP-restoring item. It is also possible to use shields and various offensive items during combat. Weapons and items can be bought in stores. Many boss battles require the player to locate the enemy's weakpoint and attack it.</p>",

The Virtua Fighter series has been heralded before as the fighting game with most involving gameplay. </p>\n<p>In Fighters Megamix, another game has been added, a game called <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/12693/fighting-vipers/\">Fighting Vipers</a>. Fighting Vipers has drastically different gameplay than the more popular Virtua Fighter 2. Instead of being sophisticated, Fighting Vipers is simplified to appeal to a wider audience of video gamers and was meant for \"casual\" gamers.</p>\n<p>Mixing a simplistic video game and a sophisticated video game must have been difficult. But Fighters Megamix manages to do so by offering many options. The most important option available is the choice of having Fighters Megamix run under the Fighting Vipers style of gameplay or the Virtua Fighter 2 style of gameplay. Other options are unlockable while playing the game.</p>\n<p>One good thing about mixing two games into one is that the game would include more selectable characters. Not only are there the 22 characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers but there are also 10 other hidden characters that can be unlocked by playing well in the Saturn version, including two from the arcade-only Sonic the Fighters. There are only 4 characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and 4 from Fighting Vipers in the Game.Com version.</p>\n<p>This game was one of the very last games to appear on the Sega Saturn in the United States and was directed by Yu Suzuki.</p>",

        "description": "<p>You play the game as Scud, a \"disposable assassin\", who has been hired to take out a target in the \"Marvin's Manikan\" factory.  Based on the underground comic by Rob Schrab, Scuds are designed to self destruct after they have destroyed their target... Scud has become aware of this fact, and instead only injures his target enough to not self-destruct.  But, being a robot, Scud has no money, and must turn to freelance jobs to pay for his original target's life support.</p>\n<p>The game can be played with either a controller or the Virtua Stunner (or other compatible light gun).  With a controller, the game is a side scrolling shoot-em-up; but with a light gun, it becomes a first person shooter.  You can play with any combination of controllers and guns, but the game is essentially meant to be played with two guns (Scud himself uses two guns).</p>\n<p>The game is fueled by music from \"DJR/IB3 LTD.\" (Darryl J. Reavis &amp; Illuminado Berrios, III), Fidget-X, and Unbelievable Jolly Machine</p>",

When he woke up, he found himself, his classmates (most of whom were girls), and a couple of unknown people in a locked room in a strange mansion. Soon the hero realizes something terrible is going on in the mansion. People are being killed under mysterious circumstances, their corpses hidden; he finds a memo soaked in blood and a photograph. Will he be able to solve the mystery and to protect the people destiny brought him together with?</p>\n<p><em>D\u014dkoku Soshite...</em> is an adventure game that incorporates elements of both Western and Japanese adventure styles. Like most \"digital novels\", there are multiple endings depending on the decisions you make during the game (mostly concerning your relationship with the girls).

For a mysterious reason, Gizarov chooses only one small town, called Gotaal. Immediately after having the town in his possession, Gizarov presses the population with heavy taxes. Landius, the son of Gotaal's mayor, fails to convince Gizarov to stop raising the taxes, and as a result, he has no other choice but to support the people in rebellion...</p>\n<p>The game returns to the traditional gameplay style of the first two <em>Langrisser</em> games. You create your character and choose his class by answering questions in the beginning of the game (similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8812/ultima/\">Ultima</a> games). Before the battles, you should recruit mercenaries, buy weapons and items, etc. Once in battle mode, you command several units led by stronger generals. Each unit has its own \"judgment\" ability; units with high judgment ability will perform more moves during a turn.</p>",

One day, Sigma is awakened from his sleep inside a storage crystal in one of Gizarov's labs by Lambda, a girl who was also created by the scientist. Apparently, a powerful lord named Rainforce has invaded Gizarov's laboratory with the intention of destroying it. Meanwhile, a powerful artificial human called Omega, another \"child\" of Gizarov, distracts Rainforce. The two heroes flee to Regenburg, a country under Gizarov's rule, only to find out that they will soon have to stop a greater evil endangering the world - a new leader of darkness, who is after the powerful evil sword Alhazard...</p>\n<p><em>Langrisser V</em> features classical <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=langrisser\">Langrisser</a>-style gameplay: you prepare your units before a battle, buy items etc., then in battle, you control various types of army units (archers, pikemen, etc.), together with the generals. The \"Judgment System\" from the previous game is back: your units can perform several moves per turn depending on their \"judgment level\". Like in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/15017/langrisser-iii/\">Langrisser III</a>, there is an element of \"love simulation\" in the game - at certain points you'll have to choose between various answers that will determine the further development of your relationship with the female party members.</p>",

The player once again controls Rami Nana-Hikari, a fourteen-year-old girl who is also the keeper of a secret treasure that unlocks valuable treasure. Dr. Pon and a new villain, Himiko Yamatai, are hunting for that treasure, and it is up to Rami to stop them.</p>\n<p>Rami traverses side-scrolling levels, defeating enemies and overcoming obstacles with the three tools: a mallet (basic melee weapon), an umbrella (allows Rami to float and deflect projectiles), and a bow (long-ranged weapon). Rami also collects spheres that award the player with useful information and points. A few stages are vertically scrolling or return to the shoot 'em up roots of the series.</p>",

The game is set in the near future, in Japan. A teenage boy named Asuka and his friends visit a demon museum. Suddenly, one of the demon statues comes to life and kidnaps Asuka's little brother. This is just a beginning of a demon invasion that Asuka and his friends must stop at all costs.</p>\n<p>Like the two previous Majin Tensei games, \"Ronde\" is a strategy RPG. You can control your characters only during battles, which occupy the entire gameplay section of the game. During the turn-based battles, you can move your characters freely on a 3D battlefield. When you come in contact with a demon, you can choose your action (attack, magic, etc.), after which an automatic battle sequence occurs. Like in all other Megaten games, you can communicate with the enemies you meet. In this particular game, the demons will initiate a conversation by themselves, which will allow you to recruit them and make them fight on your side. You can also make contracts with the demons to use their magic spells in battles.</p>",

Modes include Exhibition, World League (either single or double, with 44 matches and a grand final to crown the Grand Champion), S-League (just one round, 11 matches), cup knockout and penalty shootout, the game keeping track of statistical information of each competition. Gameplay is regular arcade, with simplicity being privileged over tactical knowledge or complex controls, with the game offering the possibility to choose between three types of controls. Other options include the ability to choose one of four difficulty levels, length of each half (3, 6 or 15 minutes) and weather conditions (fine, rain or random).</p>",

As they grow up, the oldest boy, Kazuma, becomes obsessed with power and demands to learn the sacred techniques of absolute power. The master refuses, and Kazuma leaves, vowing revenge.</p>\n<p>Many years later, long after the master's death, Kazuma returns with an army. He plots his revenge by kidnapping Aya and thus luring Sho into his hideout. As Sho, you must defeat Kazuma and rescue Aya.</p>\n<p><em>Shinobi Legions</em> is a side-scrolling action game, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=shinobi+III\">Shinobi III</a>. Sho's primary weapons are a sword and a finite number of shurikens, both of which are activated with separate buttons. Sho can learn nearly a dozen sword abilities (spinning slash, downward slash, sword shielding, etc.) by collecting powerups scattered throughout levels. There are also \"Fire Dragon\" powerups that act as single use ninja magic attacks that damage all enemies onscreen, which is the only ninja magic available to Sho. The 9 levels range from fighting in the jungle to climbing Mount Fuji, where Sho will encounter mostly enemy ninjas and a few animal enemies (eagles, snakes, etc.). <em>Shinobi Legions</em> is the only Shinobi game for the Saturn and is notable for its use of live-action cutscenes and its use of blood (the first in the series).</p>",

Something terrible is afoot at the mansion, and you must investigate things and set them right. Along the way you must discover the true purpose of the mansion and it's significance in the universe.</p>\n<p>Much like the Sega CD game, this is an FMV adventure. You move from location to location via video sequences, and solve puzzles to move on in the story.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A philosopher named DaGoulian came up with a dubious doctrine: he believes that the only way to ensure the survival of the good is by making the world more evil. He invented a special set of drums using science and alchemy, allowing him to control a power called \"skeletism\". By using this power, DaGoulian reanimates the dead, raising people's skeletons from their graves and building a fearsome army to fulfill his mad plan. However, one of these skeletons had been a person of a particularly pure heart, and instead of being afflicted with the red (evil) skeletism, he is reanimated with its blue version, allowing him to retain his free will and refuse the madman's orders. DaGoulian orders his minions to get rid of this rebel, who has to fight for his life and eventually figure a way to stop the insanity.</p>\n<p><em>Mr. Bones</em> is an action game that consists of numerous stages. With the exception of a few, each stage has a different goal and introduces unique gameplay style. The stages also vary greatly in length, some being extended platform levels and others consisting of short timed sequences. Many of the stages involve avoiding hazards or enemies, as well as tasks that must be completed within a certain time limit. Mr. Bones, the skeletal protagonist of the game, usually has no offensive arsenal. When damaged, he begins to lose limbs and bones, which affects his manoeuvrability and speed; he may even end up with nothing but a head and a neck hopping on the ground.</p>\n<p>Some of the stages are simple one-screen arcade levels, while others may deviate from the action-oriented gameplay (e.g. a stage during which the player has to combine sentences into jokes to get past guards). A few stages involve music exercises, for example a level that requires Mr. Bones to play blues guitar to impress a skeleton crowd. Another stage is a paddle game variant in which a small Mr. Bones bounces off a giant head of himself, trying to collect his own bones. In another level the hero must protect a village of tiny people against enemy assault.</p>\n<p>The story is advanced by video cutscenes displayed between the levels. Some of these are computer-generated, while others utilize footage of live actors, or a mixture of both.</p>",

The occupants of the underwater facility are ordered to board the submarine and find out what went wrong. On board the vessel, strange things are happening which are taking control of the crew. The crew are mutating due to an alien parasite and members of the search team have to figure out what is happening and how to stop it!</p>\n<p>The game is played via a third person view which is just behind the character and you look over his shoulder. The game is based underwater in a submarine so the developers have added a claustrophobic feeling by giving some areas a limited amount of air so you have to run through to activate the air circulation system. Controls are your typical Resident Evil style which is you pull the Right shoulder button to draw your gun, your d-pad to aim and then a button to shoot. Along your journey of the submarine, you will need to find objects such as keycards to unlock doors and better weapons.</p>",

You start the game as young magician Arle, who sets out to explore the land in order to uncover the mystery of a new breed of plants that have appeared that seem to be affecting the magic realm. As you are joined with other Puyo Puyo characters (friendly ones of course) you explore the land and fight baddies as well as several classic Puyo Puyo baddies.</p>\n<p>The game is played from an isometric world-map in which you explore the land and its dungeons, you can chat with NPCs and barter via screen overlays, and when in combat the game switches to a turn-based sideview in which you select your orders for each character and watch as they are executed against your enemies.</p>",

As usual for a beat 'em up, gameplay consists of you selecting your champion from a group of 14 fighters and clashing against each other using your specific moves and attacks. Additionally, each character fights with his own unique weapon, but depending on how much you block your weapon can break and you must finish the fight barehanded and using a different moveset and generally faster (but less powerful) attacks.</p>\n<p>This enhanced port features three additional speed settings and refined balance between each fighter, two all new characters (plus the main boss as a selectable fighter) a brand new intro and new backgrounds. Features single-player or two-player vs gameplay.</p>",

The story continues directly after the events of the first game: the brave hero has rescued Princess Chelsea, but she doesn't wake up. As the toys try to figure out how to solve this problem, the princess is kidnapped once again, and Pepper embarks on a journey to save her. </p>\n<p>There are some minor additions to the gameplay formula, such as collectible cards scattered through the stages, forced side-scrolling levels in which Pepper rides his horse Barobaro who shoots projectiles from his head, and a mode that allows the player to fight all the bosses from both this game and the previous one.</p>",

However, over time the role of the order is questioned, and the Reformist Faction rebel group sends three pilots in Laocorn assault robots to the WSSS' space station Daedalus in earth's orbit. Two are immediately destroyed, but the player gets to control the remaining robot.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Shinjitsu no Sekai</em> means <em>real world</em> in Japanese - and indeed, the game is set in modern-day Tokyo. The protagonist is an ordinary (at least in the beginning) girl named Marica, who lives together with her parents and her little sister. One day a dog steals a piece of meat she bought in a store. Following the dog, Marica encounters a strange, scary-looking man, who turns out to be a former terrorist on the run from his even scarier comrades, who are involved in supernatural activities. Marica becomes the sole owner of information that is vitally important to the terrorist organization, and has to protect her life with her newly discovered paranormal skills.</p>\n<p>Despite the unusual (for an RPG) setting, the gameplay system of <em>Marica</em> is similar to other Japanese RPGs. There are no random enemies, but initiating contact with a hostile character on screen leads to a turn-based battle, viewed from first-person perspective. Marica and the two other girls who join the party later in the game can attack with equipped weapons or execute their special moves. Those attacks are displayed as anime-style still shots. The story is advanced mostly through extensive dialogue (no subtitles) between characters, with large anime-style portraits super-imposed on the background.</p>",

But in every epoch, the Aragami return to bring death and destruction to Japan. </p>\n<p>Enter Momiji Fujimiya, a regular Japanese teenage girl... until she discovers that she carries the power of the princess Kushinada within her. She joins a secret government organization that specializes in fighting Aragami, receiving missions from her boss, Daitetsu Kunikida.</p>\n<p>The structure of the game is mission-based: upon receiving a mission, Momiji and the other agents (mostly young women) explore various locations in Japan, talking to people and locating the supernatural source of danger. </p>\n<p>The game has dungeon navigation, turn-based combat, and party management, but in other aspects it differs from typical Japanese RPGs. There are no random enemies, and generally not many battles. There are also no levels or experience points of any kinds. The battles utilize a card system. Depending on the character's agility (which can be increased with items), she/he can execute a number of offensive, supporting, or defensive moves by choosing a card from the available deck. Battles are won by planning and learning the enemy's strategy rather than by leveling up.</p>\n<p>Each character also has special abilities that must be used to solve puzzles. For example, one of the characters can use dynamite to blow up walls and discover hidden passages.</p>",

Aided by her lovely companions Ao, Aka, and Ki (which means blue, red, and yellow in Japanese), Silk must deal withe the evil Prince and his minions.</p>\n<p><em>Dragon Master Silk</em> is a dungeon crawler with Japanese-style turn-based combat. The entire game is viewed from first person perspective. The largest bulk of the game is navigating 3D dungeons, fighting regular enemies and bosses. The game maintains a distinct comical style, evident in graphics and character design.</p>",

Character sprites are larger in comparison to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/38034/asuka-120-excellent-burning-fest/\">the previous PlayStation entry</a>, but like most SEGA Saturn games true transparencies were removed. The story mode is a standard linear fight to fight affair with text dialog in between matches. Versus mode includes options for Player vs CPU, Player vs Player, and exhibition CPU vs CPU. The final game mode is a survival mode where the player fights each character in turn, and health is restored based upon their score during the fight.</p>",

When the evil Sage Master imprisoned her, the existence of the entire world was endangered. Using her spiritual powers, the princess contacted three Japanese high-school girls, Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu, turned them into Magic Knights, and summoned them to Cefiro, where their goal is to save her and to restore the balance.</p>\n<p>This adaptation of the eponymous manga and anime series is an action game with light role-playing elements, somewhat similar in style to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Zelda\"> Zelda</a> games. The protagonists are all the three girls, but the player can controls only one of them at a time. Each one has advantages and disadvantages, as well as different fighting styles: Hikaru uses swords, Umi a rapier, and Fuu a bow. The player advances through the game by exploring the world, talking to non-playable characters, and fighting enemies in real-time combat. There is no experience system; new abilities (among them swimming and jumping) are gained as dictated by the story, and must be used in certain points in order to advance.</p>",

However, the Saturn version comes with a few extras, in-game as well as in the packaging.</p>\n<p>In addition to the new difficulty levels and mission objectives introduced in the Playstation remake, there are more statistics and battle objectives, which can be selected directly from the main menu and then set on the difficulty/mission selection screen. The game then keeps track of these battle records, similarly to the way it registers the amount of captured animals and other mission objectives.</p>\n<p>Packaging-wise, the game comes with an additional CD which contains the game's soundtrack. A mini artwork book with level designs and character sketches is also included.</p>",

This game, at first, could be just brought from Sega directly, but nowadays it can be found in several specialized shops, plus the second hand market. It included two manuals, one in colour (the original from Daytona USA: CCE), which also served as a cover, and another in black and white, where it explained how to play online. Besides online gaming, you could also play offline. Nowadays it's still possible to play online with a direct call modem-to-modem, but not anymore through the more handy NetLink Zone, since the servers were shut down in 2001.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Tryrush Deppy</em> is a 2D platformer which plays similarly to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Sonic\">Sonic</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7298/super-mario-bros/\">Mario</a> games. The player controls a cartoony-looking taxi cab and has to get past various levels mostly set in urban environments. Some enemies can be defeated by simply jumping on them, but others have spikes and fire on their body, so in order to defeat them the player must use the Super Dash move, which grants an increased speed for a short amount of time. The super dash meter takes away gas, but it is possible to charge it up as much as one wants until it maxes out. In addition to killing enemies and bosses, super dashing can also break down certain walls that lead to secret items. Bosses each have a weak point somewhere on their body that is seen just before the battle begins.</p>",

The game expands on the first one adding more details and additional content. Game contains only three courses consisting of curved and challenging Japanese mountain roads, plus they can be played in various seasons which requires a whole new driving tactic. Main racing modes include \"King Battle\" (main mode where you have to prove yourself to be the king and win all the races), \"Free Battle\" (one player mode where you can select your rival and your car and test your skill), \"VS Battle\" (a two-player mode where you can play against your friend in a split-screen view), and \"Training\" (which offers Time Attack, Free Driving and Dricon where you get rewarded based on your drifting skill).</p>",

It is a digital scrapbook of the Suchie-Pai series so far, compiled in the form of an internet browser-like interface (known as Suchie-Explorer 4.7). From here you can access a video interview with character designer Kenichi Sonoda, galleries of art from previous games in the series, galleries of various other promotional art, figures, flyers, posters, and cards, the Suchie Dictionary, and the Waku Waku chat. There are also a couple mini-games. First there is the Lilim quiz, a harder version of the quiz game from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/59765/suchie-pai-adventure-doki-doki-nightmare/\">Suchie-Pai Adventure: Doki Doki Nightmare</a>.

It is very similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/68420/gals-panic-4/\">Gals Panic 4</a> before it in that all the girls are drawn in an anime style, with no photographic models whatsoever. The gameplay is changed in this game. The same basic gameplay of uncovering a girl's picture with <em>Qix</em>-like gameplay is used, but you spend 5 rounds on each girl. After this, instead of moving on to the next girl, the game saves and ends. You then play another girl after starting the game again. There is a gallery where the unlocked CG can be viewed. There are a total 12 models in the game, the last two unlocked after beating all the available girls. Some of these girls are reused from <em>Gals Panic 4</em>.</p>",

Also, a side-step dodge through the L and R buttons can be done, showing that the game also uses a 3D gameplay.</p>\n<p>The game features a cast of 13 characters, 4 of them being the programmers themselves. The game modes available are varied: the classical arcade mode, a 1-round survival mode, a tournament against the CPU or against human opponents, spectator mode, training mode and there's also a character customization mode.</p>\n<p>All menu options, character names, etc. are in Japanese.</p>",

The difficulty level has been drastically reduced for both games. On the other hand, the amount of random enemy encounters is noticeably higher. Several gameplay elements have been simplified: for example, simply passing near a secret button prompts a text message; the absence of text input makes many puzzles much easier, merely requiring the player to choose the correct answer among several available ones, possibly through guesswork; there are no topics to discuss with the NPCs; mechanics such as traps and chest opening are simplified, etc.</p>\n<p>Both games have polygonal 3D graphics, as opposed to the pseudo-3D locations of the original releases. Despite the new visuals, the layouts of the areas remain largely identical. Unlike the PlayStation version of <em>Crusaders of the Dark Savant</em>, this release retains the hand-drawn 2D portraits for enemies and NPCs for both titles. There is also a full soundtrack for <em>Bane of the Cosmic Forge</em>, which was not present in the earlier version.</p>",

The game features Edogawa Rampo, a Japanese mystery novel writer, as a protagonist and is based on the movie with the same name which was released a year earlier. In real life, Edogawa Rampo (\u6c5f\u6238\u5ddd \u4e71\u6b69) is a pseudonym of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Hirai+Tarou\">Hirai Tarou</a> (\u5e73\u4e95 \u592a\u90ce), a Japanese novelist who wrote mystery fiction in the early-to-middle of 20th century.</p>\n<p>Having a writer's block and still under influence that your work has been banned from publishing due to the level of disturbance portrayed, with your editor, Yokomizo Seishi, pressing you to write your next piece, you just can't wrap around your head to make it happen. So you get up from your writing desk and head to do the landlord business and pick up the rent from the occupants. The place is man-exclusive, there is no women allowed, yet you secretly find out someone has been bringing a woman and not just to talk to. What may have started as debauchery will soon turn your life around when it reveals a much bigger mystery than you bargained for.</p>\n<p>The game is played in 1st-person perspective where you can turn left or right, or move forward and backward. Moving forward in closed locations will often end up in zooming certain objects and occasionally pick them up if they are of any importance. Picked up objects can be viewed in your inventory and used in certain locations or during dialogues. Movie is not free 3D movement, but instead uses pre-rendered cutscenes for every movement animation. Characters will often cycle through their dialogues unless there is a time where you can inquire about some item from your inventory. Yokomizo Seishi, your editor, will accompany you and will often provide comments when you won't be able to go to certain areas or if you try to do weird things (i.e. try to go outside without a reason, or try to unlock someone else's room without a proper cause). Occasionally your protagonist will also speak, at which moment the picture will be frozen (there is no idle movements of characters or animate objects in the areas when you're talking or just standing still).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Hiyake no Omoide</em> (\u65e5\u707c\u3051\u306e\u601d\u3044\u51fa) is a jigsaw puzzle game for one or two players featuring photo stills and live videos. The puzzle pieces portray stills and videos featuring five different girls, namely Ayumi (\u685c\u4e95 \u4e9c\u5f13), Mami (\u9577\u8c37\u5ddd \u771f\u7f8e), Kyoko (\u85e4\u672c \u606d\u5b50), Miwako (\u5de5\u85e4 \u7f8e\u548c\u5b50), and Chiyoko (\u5c71\u5ba4 \u5343\u4ee3\u5b50).</p>\n<p>The game feature three gameplay modes. Movie Puzzle mode features countdown mode where player races against time to assemble the animated jigsaw puzzle. Animated thumbnail video can be scrolled over to get the better preview. Upon completing the puzzle, the player is rewarded with fullscreen video of the girl in question, and the next jigsaw puzzle video gets unlocked. VP Puzzle mode lets you play against other player or CPU where photo is displayed only for a brief moment before the game starts. During the battle, puzzles set in place by each of the player are marked with the player's color on the grid map. But the battle isn't just about who can put the right piece at the right place faster, instead, there are several different traps and weapons of a sort that one player can use against the other player such as having a character hunt down the puzzle piece the player is carrying and take it off, or mess up the player controls to make everything reverse. The last mode is called Himekuri and is a single-player mode for assembling the jigsaw puzzle of a still image.</p>\n<p>Options, which are accessible via main menu, feature movie and photo viewers which let you watch all the videos and photo still you have unlocked during your gameplay. Unlike the majority of Sega Saturn jewel case packages, the game comes in a sleeve which contains jewel case sized cardboard digipak with CD slot and manuals which are made as part of the digipak.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Tetris S</em> is the second of two <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/105/tetris-licensees/\">Tetris games</a> released for the Sega Saturn in 1996. Unlike the arcade port <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4071/tetris-plus/\">Tetris Plus</a> which was released a few months earlier, it was specifically made for the console. This version includes a single player mode as well as multiplayer against an AI or between two human players. </p>\n<p>The single player mode works like traditional Tetris and uses the same rotation rules as Sega's earlier arcade game conversions. Like always the player guides blocks down a well with the aim of creating lines at the bottom. These lines are then removed and the player earns points. The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the well, but in this version there is a continue option allowing the player to keep playing at the current level. The multiplayer works the same way but with one difference: if more than one line is removed the opponent's next few blocks will fall at a greater pace. The number of lines removed affects how many blocks will be sped up. A multiplayer game is played over a set number of matches and the aim is simply to stay alive longer than the opponent.</p>",

Animated thumbnail video can be scrolled over to get the better preview. To select the model you wish to use for jigsaw puzzle backdrop, you need to spin the selection and stop it which works similar to roulette wheel. Each model has 7 different videos which need to be assembled and unlocked sequentially after which every unlocked video can be replayed in any order.</li>\n<li>VS Puzzle - A two player match which lets you play against another player or a CPU. Unlike the regular modes, versus matches include a few more kinks and give you gadgets to help you solve the puzzle faster and hinder your opponent.</li>\n<li>Puzzle Club - A single-player mode for assembling the jigsaw puzzle of a still image. There is no countdown, but the fastest solving time is logged per photo, the default one is set to 99 minutes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Options, which are accessible via main menu, feature movie and photo viewers which let you watch all the videos and photo still you have unlocked during your gameplay.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Sakura Tsuushin</em> is a romantic visual novel adventure which follows the story of Touma Inaba (\u56e0\u5e61 \u51ac\u99ac), the protagonist, who is trying to get into Keio University. On the day the exam scores are posted, he meets Mieko Yotsuba (\u56db\u8449 \u7f8e\u54b2\u5b50), a readhead he falls in love to at first sight. After he finds out she got in, but didn't, he decides to lie and say he passed the exam and got into in order to impress her. He lives with Urara Kasuga (\u6625\u65e5 \u9e97) who has an unrequited love for him which is the only reason why she doesn't tell anyone that he is not really a college student and helps him in his love pursuit.</p>\n<p>The game features anime style video clips as well as dialogues with slightly animated characters on static backdrops which forwards the story, branching it based on players actions and answers during conversation with other characters. Save game options is only available at key points in the story and cannot be done anywhere during gameplay as is case with most of visual novels. Bottom screen is used for text and does not have opacity, with graphical content appearing only in the upper area, whether static images or video clips. Certain key animations are done in full screen.</p>",

It uses an isometric perspective in a 3D-polygon environment, where up to four characters of the Bomberman universe can fight each other in battles, either controlled by the AI or a human companion. </p>\n<p>Players start out with the ability to jump over obstacles and throw bombs without having to collect powerups first, and there is also a health meter, so it's possible to survive more than one bomb blast. A brown horse is the only mount available, it can move quickly, absorb damage, and swallow bombs. Aside from the core battle mode, there is a story mode (which is rather similar to the battle mode in that it consists of matches against computer players) and a survival mode which goes endlessly on until the player is defeated.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Set in the year of 4998, after the war with an alien race, the battle is no longer waged with devastating weapons but through a contest of physical strength between representatives of each race. In <em>Battle Athletes</em>, Akari Kanzaki (\u795e\u5d0e \u3042\u304b\u308a), the protagonist of the story, but not the player, is a daughter of a former Cosmic Beauty who promised her mother on her deathbed to follow in her steps. Akari enrolls in a training school and strives to shape her body and become the next Cosmic Beauty. The story progresses one day at the time, leaving you to go through a half-year long training with Akari. The player can go to various areas in the school, talk to other characters, and perform daily training routines such as running, swimming, aerobics, and more. As Akari trains more, her physical characteristics improve, such as stamina, endurance, strength, and other. To check Akari's current stats, you can visit the school nurse to give you a rundown on her current condition. The game mostly plays as visual novel and features anime style videos and voice-acting. Characters during conversation are not animated in any way, but character portrait icons appear in various expressions to emphasize their posture during dialogues.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Friends: Seishun no Kagayaki</em> is a console port of an adult visual novel <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dousoukai\">Dousoukai</a> for PC. Sega Saturn port was released 3 years after the PC version and has all the adult content removed but is fully voice-acted. A PlayStation 2 port came 5 years after the Sega Saturn release in two versions, first one marked with age 18 restriction and second one a year later with age 15 restriction. Both PS2 versions, however, do not feature adult CG event scenes, but are fully voiced and have a new opening animation whereas Sega Saturn version does not feature an opening animation.</p>\n<p>This is the first game in the <em>Dousoukai</em> series and starts with you on your way to a nice resort to reunite with some of your classmates from high-school. In particular, your tennis team members. The game focuses on romance and features full map of the place you're staying at as well as the rural town and its surrounding area. The game occurs through one week time and lets you visit any location on the map during both daytime and nighttime, which advances the time. An icon of a character marks when someone is at some location, but not who the person is. This visual novel features typical static anime characters sprites with light animation such as talking animations, pasted over background images. CG event scenes occur with the right character at the right place and time. Your dialogue choices and actions affect how the story progresses and if you will end up with one of the heroines or help with the match-making for your friends.</p>",

Aside from starting point in Japan, there are 15 move levels scattered across Oahu island. Levels are made in a way to tell the traveling story of Kimika and feature live-action animation that looks in the background of the jigsaw puzzle. Jigsaw puzzles aren't the typical in look and size but are mostly square in overall shape with a bit of embellishments inside which helps determine the shape and minimizes the number of places where it can fit. Player takes puzzle piece from the right side (two are visible on screen, but player can look through all remaining pieces and place them in any wanted order) and put them on top of the big portion of left part of the screen where the jigsaw puzzle with animated video in the background is placed. Kimika will tell you in her own voice if the placed piece of puzzle fits or not. Any reached levels can be selected and replayed from the travel map.</p>\n<p>Aside from the main story, from the main menu the player can also access data room which holds about a dozen or so photo still of Kimika Yoshino along with a scrollable info about her... and not just the three-number proportion, but also trivia on par with her favorite animal, favorite food, pet name, and whatnot. A bonus game which is also accessible from the main menu is a Quiz game. There, Kimika will ask you through pre-recorded live-action videos ten questions about herself to see how big of a fan you are and how well you know here. All answers yield to \"yes\" or \"no\" option only and will prompt her different reaction whether you answer them correctly or incorrectly. In the end, the score screen will show a specific photo of Kimika and her message to you depending on how well you answered her questions.</p>\n<p>In the game options screen, aside from typical audio setup and level difficulty selection, they player can also assign controller keys and check any of the 49 unlockable movies. First print featured a present campaign where the first 500 players could get an alarm clock featuring Kimika Yoshino's photo and wake-up voice.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Gihren's Greed</em> is a turn-based strategy game set in the Gundam universe. The game follows the One Year War between Zion Dukedom and United Nations. The war lasts 150 turns for the player, where they can either try to achieve scenario victory or complete victory over the enemy. There are two story based campaign where player can play on either side of the conflict. The battlefield uses hexagonal grid where player can produce or move units, conquer cities or attack enemy forces on ground, in the air, and even in space. The battlefield is split into two maps; a world map that lets player conquer all the continents, and space map which focuses on the battle in planet's orbit. Battles take place simultaneously and player can switch between two maps at any point during the game.</p>\n<p>Units consist of tanks, planes, spaceships, and most importantly, mobile suits which can battle both in space and on the planet. On either side the player has access to all his generals and commanders, and just as some ace pilots, they will often comment on the situation when engaging in combat. The game features a variant of fog-of-war that only obscures enemy units, but not terrain nor enemy bases. Each turn is divided in to 4 phases: Strategy Phase, Action Setting Phase, Enemy Thinking Phase, and Attack Execution Phase.</p>\n<p>Strategy Phase is where the player manages their troops and personnel, funds research, and develops new weapons of war. Action Setting Phase is the unit action phase, where the player can give orders to their extant units, deploy units stationed in bases, and produce more units. All commands are carried out immediately except for attacks. Enemy Thinking Phase is simply the combined Strategy and Action Setting phases of the computer, during which the player is not allowed to view its actions and is shown a progress bar instead. Last is Attack Execution Phase, where all attack orders in Action Setting Phase are carried out one at a time.</p>\n<p>Terrain limits movement of ground forces, making tanks move faster on the roads than through forests or over mountains. The game also implements Zone of Control mechanics: Having multiple units surrounding enemy will result in additional fire support to your troops and will deal more damage to the unit that you are attacking or is attacking you. </p>\n<p>Interestingly, the the game manual is split in two parts; first half is typical gameplay tutorial, while the second part contains an illustrated scenes and list of some key military operations in One Year War from Gundam universe.</p>",

        "description": "<p>An idol group known as Otomegumi (\u4e59\u5973\u7d44) is staying at the western-style boarding house in a spa resort in Izu (\u4f0a\u8c46), Japan. You, Takeshi Gouda (\u90f7\u7530 \u6b66\u53f2), as a professional photographer came, along with your team which includes Ryouichi Akada (\u8d64\u7530 \u826f\u4e00), your editor, and Takuya Sasaki (\u4f50\u3005\u6728 \u62d3\u4e5f), your young assistant, to make a photo album of that very idol group. As you arrive at the boarding house you meet with Otomegumi idol group consisting of Rei, Maki, and Shouko, as well as with some other suspicious looking characters on the premise. Due to a sudden storm, you decide to wait it out and use that opportunity to get to know everyone a little better. But the evening doesn't go as well as expected and some unpleasant words are exchanged with Seiji Tashiro (\u7530\u4ee3 \u6210\u6cbb), an idol group manager. Ryouichi had to step in a couple of time to prevent things from escalating, but by the time everyone went to bed it all seemed to have quiet down.</p>\n<p>Next morning, you, the idol group, Ryouichi, Takuya, and Chieko Naemura (\u82d7\u6751 \u5343\u6075\u5b50) who is a stylist for Otomegumi idol group all went to hot springs for some photo session. The photos are going fine and things were about to wrap up when the distressing rumor about someone being dead back at the boarding house have reached you. You all pack your things and head back to the boarding house. There, you find the owners of the boarding house, Kyousuke Nakagawa (\u4e2d\u5ddd \u4eac\u4ecb) and his wife Reiko Nakagawa (\u4e2d\u5ddd \u9e97\u5b50), standing in front of a room of none other than Seiji Tashiro who was a troublemaker since the moment you met him. At closer inspection you soon realize it's a murder as he appears to have been stabbed with a knife. But who would have a reason to kill him? Suspects... motives... opportunities... anyone could be the killers, and to top it all, you cannot call the police as phone line appears to be dead. With the killer among you, what was to be a nice relaxing vacation is turning into a murder mystery that is far from being over.</p>\n<p>The game plays like a straight visual novel consisting of text over current background which is comprised on many photo stills to match the dialogue and emotion of the scene in question. Occasionally the player is presented with dialogue choices which may affect the current situation but there is no real branching in the main story, just different reactions by the people addressing you. Voice-acting is almost non-present and appears only in key dialogues between the player and the idols, and usually for no more than a single short sentence. In photo session player can take a limited number of photos but does not control camera movement, instead, camera moves up and down once and the player has the chance to take a photo or keep the movie to use on the next pose. Limited bonus contained in a package is an envelope containing an actual photo from one of the photo sessions in the game.</p>",

(featuring wind speed as high as 30 meters).</p>\n<p>Another unique feature of this game is the ability to increase shot distance when you hit a perfect shot.

Based on a real-life X Japan concert held at the Tokyo Dome on December 30 and 31, 1994, it puts the player in the role of a concert photographer. The player starts out backstage, able to navigate the Tokyo Dome from a first-person perspective through live-action still photos and video scenes. By speaking to backstage employees and searching through rooms, they can access their press pass and photo equipment; this grants the player the ability to go onstage to photograph the concert. At this point the game switches over to video footage of the concert; the player can't control the camera, but can decide when to take photos.</p>",

While the anime has been localized to <em>Those Who Hunt Elves</em> title in English-speaking countries, the game itself is Japan-exclusive release. The story follows Junpei, Airi, and Ritsuko, who have been magically transported to fantasy new world. In order to return home, they have to find five spell fragments that have been placed on the skin of certain elves, which means in order to check which elf has the fragment they'll have to strip him or her naked. The story plays as a typical Japanese adventure game which feels like a visual novel with static backgrounds and characters, but also with a list of verb commands the player can click on each location (i.e. look, talk, move). The map shows each of the character and their locations and as the story progresses new locations become available. The game has full voice-acting and subtitle of spoken text can be turned off, otherwise they appear in a window with a name of currently talking character.</p>",

        "description": "<p>When a high school girl gets a sudden transfer to the prestigious boarding school her parents went to, she expects her life has nowhere to go but up. She's immediately thrust into the school's complicated political dynamics, where she has to ask herself: who is that strange, menacing girl who keeps showing up? What is this student council that seems to rule the school from the shadows? Why does someone seem to have it in for her? And why does it feel like there's something about their past her parents aren't telling her?</p>\n<p>Based on the classic anime <em>Revolutionary Girl Utena</em>, this game lets the player experience surreal school life at Ohtori Academy. Instead of having the player take control of one of the show's characters, the game's protagonist is a brand-new character meeting the cast for the first time. Players can make alliances (and enemies) as they interact with characters and settle in; the story branches based on how characters feel about the protagonist, with nine possible endings and an enormous number of branching story paths. A page in the player's student handbook shows the player how every one of the main cast feels about her, letting the player be strategic with the route they take through the game.</p>\n<p><em>Utena</em> captures the show's aesthetic with art and music taken directly from the show alongside new artwork, cutscenes and music which match the original show's presentation. All dialogue is fully voice-acted with the original actors from the show reprising their roles, alongside new actors playing the game's original characters.</p>",

There are three different pinball tables:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Basketball Legend - Has the theme of a basketball court with coach-styled messages.</li>\n<li>Card Master - Based on a casino theme, featuring poker and roulette.</li>\n<li>Circus Fantasia - Displays a circus-styled theme with scoring for stunts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The two modes in the game are the pinball mode, which feature only the pinball tables for the highest score or the story mode. In the story mode, a crippled basketball college student goes to a bar where he is inspired to become the best pinball champion player in the United States. The career-styled gameplay requires the player to make use of limited funds to make purchases, travel between cities and resting to stay healthy. Money is earned by beating opponents' scores in pinball or by winning a basketball mini-game.</p>",

The player takes the role of Vanilla Essence, a young girl who dreams of being a star, and the story follows her quest from eating breakfast through to a duet with her favourite superstar, the puzzlingly named Mr. Chorking!</p>\n<p>The gameplay itself takes the form of call-and-response dance and song duets with various characters, where the other character will sing a line and you\u2019re asked to repeat it. Lyrics appear in a shaded box at the top of the screen, while input prompts appear in the first of a pair of bars along the bottom of the screen as they sing, and the player then repeats it on the second bar. Ad-libbed inputs are also permitted, and there are specific ad-lib segments.</p>\n<p>Vanilla Essence\u2019s performance is then graded in five categories and given an overall score. A score above 70 is a passing grade, and allows continuing to the next story segment. Between story segments there is a short full-motion video cutscene connecting the dots.</p>\n<p>The game additionally includes a practice mode, as well as a 2-player battle mode, where two players can compare their skills.</p>",

One of Prison's managers, Willy Wombat, opts to escape this society in search of freedom in the land of Eden. To get there, he must search for six miracle gems, scattered across Prison. However, these gems attract deadly ghosts, who Willy must deal with using his set of attacks, including his boomerang. The other managers of Prison are also on Willy's tail, seeking to eliminate him. Essential items are scattered throughout these areas, like crystals, keys, and force powerups, that will aid Willy in his quest to find Eden.</p>",

Players can take control of one out 2 available characters, with 2 extra characters being unlockable as players clear the game.</p>\n<p>Apart from the standard punches and kicks, the game offers special attacks which drain a bit of health when successfully used and a dash option as well. Weapons and objects can also be picked up and used against enemies. The game is linear, opting to put players through a lot of short stages which last for a few minutes before switching to a new one.</p>",

Players blast off into space to take out waves of enemy spacecraft through several different levels. Most of the game is presented from an overhead view with a slightly tilted camera, giving the player a slightly longer view of the stage. A few stages switch the camera up to a chase camera, which is set behind the player's craft as they shoot at enemies as they fly towards the camera instead. There are three different craft, but unlike in most shooters players don't choose one at the beginning; instead, players can switch forms at any time to respond to the current situation. Unlike in most arcade-style shooters, there's no score whatsoever: the player's goal is simply to survive to the end of the game, not to reach any kind of high score.</p>",

The story once again follows Jajamaru-kun on a quest to rescue Princess Sakura from the clutches of Catfish Tayu. Like the previous game, levels contain power-ups for Jajamaru-kun to collect, and defeating enemies and collecting silver pieces awards points which add up to a score at the end of each level.</p>\n<p>Although most of the game takes place in 3D environments, it also includes some 2D levels in the style of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/37993/ninja-jajamaru-kun/\">Ninja Jajamaru-kun</a> game so that the 2D and 3D approaches to the series can be directly compared.</p>",

        "description": "<p><i>Solo Crisis</i> is a strategy game for Saturn loosely inspired by the world-management sections of Quintet's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6704/actraiser/\">ActRaiser</a>. Gameplay takes place on a 3D game field, presented in via an isometric angle. The game world is divided into two sides, a light world on the upper half and a dark world on the flip side. Any changes made to the terrain of one side are reflected in inverse on the other side; for example, forming the land into a mountain on the light half produces a valley on the dark half. A portal between the two sides is present in one portion of each stage, providing a chance for both player units and enemies to pass through to the other side.</p>",

Pairs of blocks in four colors drop from the top of the screen, and the goal is to line up two or more blocks of the same color, with another pair of a different matching color at either end. Any blocks on top of the ones cleared will fall into the open space, potentially comboing together into chains. Clearing multiple sets of blocks in a combo or chain will send garbage blocks to the opponent's playfield, and also charge up a super move that triggers automatically at a certain threshold which can clear a large number of blocks from the playfield.</p>\n<p>The game has a single-player story mode in which Bakabon's dad, refusing to wake up in the morning, gets sucked up by his wife's vacuum cleaner and sent to a strange puzzle world where he must defeat the other characters from the show in puzzle battles. There is also a two-player versus mode with nine playable characters.</p>",

The player must explore the mansion-like casino in first person, avoiding traps and looking for helpful items, and eventually find each of the demons to challenge them to various gambling games such as roulette and blackjack. As the player wins coins, the demons will gradually remove their clothing until they are completely nude, at which point they can be sealed within a playing card. If the player loses, then their soul is lost for eternity to the demon queen.</p>\n<p>There are seven demons throughout the casino to find, each of whom has a particular game they like best. After sealing a particular demon, the player can visit a viewing room and spend coins to view various nude scenes of that girl. The game is divided into three floors, and after sealing all the demons on a floor, the player will receive a key that leads to the next one.

        "description": "<p><em>Chibi Maruko-chan no Taisen Puzzle Dama</em> is a falling-block puzzle game based on the children's manga and anime <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/13643/chibi-maruko-chan-licensees/\">Chibi Maruko-chan</a>. The game plays very similarly to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/2464/puyo-puyo-games/\">Puyo Puyo</a>: colored balls fall from the top of the well in pairs, and must be arranged and stacked by the player. If three or more of the same color touch, they will disappear from the board, causing any stacked on top to fall down into their place and potentially creating a combo. Clearing many balls at once will launch garbage balls at the opposing player, and each character has a different pattern for how garbage appears and what colors it consists of. Garbage balls will turn into regular balls after a ball in a neighboring space is cleared. If either player's stack reaches the top of their well, that player loses the round.</p>\n<p>The game includes a single-player arcade mode against a series of computer opponents, as well as a two-player versus mode.</p>",

A new form of entertainment called Neo Pro Wrestling, which allows combatants to use powered armor and other enhancements, is rapidly gaining in popularity. The Pretty Four are a team of teenage wrestlers/pop idols, riding high after their newest member, Miku, snatched a world championship victory. Suddenly, a new tournament is announced by a mysterious new group called The Lion's Den, and Miku and the Pretty Four decide to take on the challenge.</p>\n<p><em>Metal Fighter Miku</em> is a Japanese-style adventure/simulation game based on the 1994 animated series of the same name. It features a new scenario in six chapters set six months after the events of the show, essentially functioning as a sequel. The player controls Miku and must develop her abilities and ultimately win each match as the story progresses.</p>\n<p>The game is divided into two main sections. Most of the story plays out in standard visual novel-style dialogue sequences, with occasional choices that affect the flow of the conversation. Wrestling matches play out as real-time sequences where the player must select actions from a menu; available actions and current fighter status are shown at the bottom of the screen, while the top of the screen shows large illustrations of the match in action. Matches can be decided by pinfall, count out, or submission.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mobile Suit Gundam</em> is a side-scrolling action game based on the popular 1979 animated series of the same title and its three film adaptations, casting the player as the series' main character, the young pilot Amuro Ray. The story generally follows the plot of the films with only minor changes, and includes new animation from the original animation studio Sunrise that remakes famous scenes from the original.</p>\n<p>The player pilots the titular RX-78-2 Gundam in both ground-based run-and-gun and space-based flight stages, using various weapons to destroy enemies; Radio chatter from other characters plays throughout each stage, and it is often necessary to destroy all enemies in an area to advance the story. As missions are completed, additional weapons become available and the player can customize their equipment loadout before each stage. Of special note is the Newtype Attack, which when charged and locked on will deal instant damage to targeted enemies, including enemies in the foreground and background outside the range of normal attacks.</p>",

Blocks of various colors fall into the well in pairs; each block has two connections, and connecting three or more blocks together regardless of color will cause them to disappear. Any blocks above the ones removed will fall into the now-open space, potentially creating chain combos which will send garbage blocks that must be cleared twice to the opponent. Additionally, connecting four blocks of the same color will clear all blocks of that color from the board, while connecting four each of a different color together will clear all the garbage blocks on the screen by one stage. If the blocks stack past the line at the top of the well, that player loses the match.</p>\n<p>The game includes a single-player story mode, as well as a free battle mode against the computer or another player. There are 10 different characters to choose from: five Ultra Heroes and five aliens.</p>",

One day they're goofing around at a shrine taking photos, and accidentally break a seal and release 108 spirits that had been sealed there. These spirits are terribly mischievous, and even turn one of the girls' classmates -- who was with them taking the photos -- into a strange mystical gem! The old man who watches over the shrine confronts the girls, telling them that it's their fault that the spirits escaped. They are each granted a secret transformation power that allows them to fight the sprits, and now it's their responsibility to capture the spirits and seal them back up again.</p>\n<p><em>Omakase! Savers</em> is a comedy adventure game featuring live-action scenes. The player takes the role of the girls' classmate, who appears as a small ghost, and must guide the girls in their quest to seal the spirits again and restore their classmate to his human form. This primarily takes the form of exploring the town on foot, talking to the townsfolk and investigating to find the whereabouts of the spirits causing trouble. Occasional combat takes a semi-real-time format, with the player moving around freely but pausing to perform attacks.</p>\n<p>The game is divided into four chapters, each focusing on a specific spirit that must be defeated and captured. The characters in the game are represented both by anime-style sprites and digitized photo portraits of real actors, while numerous live-action cutscenes drive the story.</p>",

As in the previous game, the player manages staff hiring and player scouting, sponsorships and publicity, match and training scheduling, and of course choose the team's hometown and uniforms. New in this entry are the ability to create up to three custom players for the team, additional options for post-match publicity and commentary, and a completely revamped in-game match display system that lets the player watch each match in a much more realistic style.</p>",

Rensa Hitsuy\u014d</em> is a competitive falling-block puzzle game based on the <em>Tenchi Muyo!</em> anime series, similar to the popular <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/2464/puyo-puyo-games/\">Puyo Puyo</a> series. Pairs of blocks in various colors fall into the playfield, and the player must arrange them; if three or more of the same color are matched together, they will vanish from the playfield and allow blocks above them to fall into their place and potentially trigger combo chains. Combo chains will cause the water level in the opponent's playfield to rise; blocks cannot be dropped below the water line, and if either the blocks or the water reach the top of the playfield that player loses the match. Several other special blocks also appear on occasion: Heart blocks will lower the water level when matched, Anchor blocks will push any blocks below them down into the water, and Ryo-oki blocks will trigger the selected character's special move when matched.</p>\n<p>The game includes a single-player story mode, a two-player battle mode, and a free battle mode against the CPU, as well as a tutorial that explains the game rules. There are six playable characters, all of them the girls from the show; Tenchi himself is not playable.</p>",

The main story mode is presented as the four days of a travelogue visiting Hollywood, California; each day includes two video puzzles of each type, plus a \"bonus stage\" which consists of an extra video of photo of Sakaki.

        "description": "<p>Leon is a young boy of 16 who lives in Barcelona, and the son of the famous adventurer Fal Aventura. One day, the wreckage of his father's ship washes up on the shores of the city and, in order to find out what happened to his father, the young Leon sets out on a voyage of his own. Trusting that his father is still alive somewhere, Leon leaves to explore the world by sea, searching for the truth.</p>\n<p><em>Daib\u014dken: Saint Elmos no Kiseki</em> is a seafaring pirate-themed JRPG similar to Koei's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/253/uncharted-waters-daikokai-jidai-series/\">Uncharted Waters</a> series. The game is roughly divided up into two main sections: sea travel, and on-foot town exploration, which each also have their own dedicated mode of combat. On-foot combat plays out in standard JRPG style, with the player choosing an action for each member of their party and watching as the results play out. Naval combat on the other hand takes a semi-real-time format where the player directs each ship in their fleet, issuing commands to attempt to sink all enemy ships, then board the lead ship and take out the captain in standard combat.</p>\n<p>Most towns are infested with monsters when first reached, and the monsters must be defeated before the player can explore the town properly. Towns contain many types of businesses, such as inns and shops, taverns where crewmen can be recruited, and shipyards where the player's ship can be upgraded in both offensive and defensive capabilities. In addition to equipping the ship's crew, the player must also ensure they have enough resources such as food and clean water for each voyage.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Delisoba Deluxe</em> is an action driving game in which the player must drive a scooter to deliver soba noodles while avoiding obstacles. It is a promotional tie-in based on a popular game called <em>Delisoba</em> (short for \"Delivery Soba\") on the TV variety show <em>Sekiguchi Hiroshi no Tokyo Friend Park II</em> broadcast by TBS between 1994 and 2011. On the original show, one player controls the scooter in a video game, while the other player sits on the back of a simulated scooter; if the first player crashes in the game, the second player feels the impact on the scooter and has to try not to drop the delivery.</p>\n<p>The \"TV Original\" mode replicates the <em>Delisoba</em> experience from the show, tasking the player with reaching the end of the course within the time limit, avoiding obstacles such as other cars, banana peels, and angry cows, to deliver the noodles to the TBS television building in Tokyo. There are also several extra modes: a \"Time Attack\" mode that tracks the player's best times, a \"Coin Links\" mode where the player collects coins strewn across the track for points, an Arrange mode where various options can be changed such as adding special items or changing the max speed of the scooter, and a Track Edit mode where custom courses can be made.</p>",

The game follows roughly the same story as the TV show, expanded with new content and animated sequences: the main character Carrot Glac\u00e9, along with his brother Marron, and the sisters Tira and Chocola, are so-called \"Sorcerer Hunters\" who serve the church to track down and exact punishment on Sorcerers who use their magic to commit evil acts against other humans.</p>\n<p>The game proceeds mostly in a visual novel style, with voiced story sequences occasionally broken up with dialogue choices. There are also two mini-games which represent battles: a flag-raising minigame where the player must raise or lower the correct flag within the time limit, and a slot-machine battle where the results of the slot machine determine which actions each combatant takes. Both mini-games can also be freely played from the menu.</p>\n<p>The game was only released as a \"limited edition\" version, which includes a poster and a bonus disc that contains voice actor interviews and an illustration gallery.</p>",

The game is divided into eight chapters, and looks at a glance like a Japanese-style RPG with turn-based battles and top-down exploration. However, the RPG elements are purely superficial; there is no experience or character growth system, no inventory to manage, and while it is possible to die, all encounters are scripted as part of each chapter's progression. There are also several different mini-games which appear throughout the story and can also be played from the main menu.</p>",

Relatively unique among <em>Gundam</em> games, it tells an original story not adapted from another media, and is the first in a three-part trilogy. It is set during the One Year War, shortly after Operation Odessa; the player controls Earth Federation pilot Yuu Kajima, who alongside his teammates Philip Hughes and Summona Fulis are sent on missions with experimental Mobile Suits in order to collect data for production. The team encounters a mysterious blue Mobile Suit that seems bent on eradicating Yuu's team, and which seems to show up without warning.</p>\n<p>The game is divided into five missions, each of which has specific objectives such as destroying a particular target or defending a specific structure or character. The story is told through radio communications during gameplay, and objectives may change as the mission progresses. There are no branching story paths or loadout customization, though the player is ranked at the end of each mission which has an effect on the overall ending. Save data can be carried over into <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/211289/mobile-suit-gundam-side-story-ii-ao-o-uketsugu-mono/\">the sequel</a>.</p>",

However, when he reached the nest, the mother bird saw him and chased him away. Upon returning to his village in defeat, Lucas finds all the homes ransacked and everyone gone but one young piglet, who is snatched away by a bird right before his eyes. Lucas sets out to rescue the piglets, and his journey will take him all across the island.</p>\n<p><em>Minami no Shima ni Buta ga Ita: Lucas no Daib\u014dken</em> (\"There was a Pig on the South Island: Lucas' Great Adventure\") is a puzzle game featuring an assortment of logic puzzles. The game is divided into six themed worlds, and each world is divided into six levels in two types. Even-numbered stages are simple platform action sequences where Lucas can jump and use a whip to attack, avoiding enemies and looking for piglets to rescue. Odd-numbered stages take the form of various logic puzzles similar to those one might find in a puzzle magazine, such as arranging numbers to have them all add up to a certain sum, or rolling dice around so that they all show the same image on their face. These puzzles can be skipped, but clearing them will rescue a larger number of piglets.</p>",

These pups come in many different forms, which each have their own abilities and personalities \u2014 some may be good at fighting, some may have strong defense, some might have high agility or other unique skills \u2014 and the player starts out by selecting a team of five. Each of the pups functions like a virtual pet-style creature, tracking not only its health but also its trust and affection with the player.</p>\n<p>The player character does not appear directly in the world or control the pups directly, but rather can issue commands to each of the pups such as to move or stop, use an item, attack a target, or activate a special ability. There are a variety of different missions which each have a different goal, such as causing the sun to rise, collecting shards of shooting stars, or defeating an evil familiar.</p>",

The game follows standard sound novel format, with unvoiced dialogue and narration over still images depicting the current scene, occasionally interrupted by choices which branch the story path. There are three main scenarios that can unfold \u2014 one in which Kitar\u014d investigates the recent disappearance of bodies, one in which he investigates the source of the mysterious snow, and one in which a fake copy of Kitar\u014d himself appears \u2014 each with multiple endings depending on the player's choices.</p>",

The arcade-style format is largely unchanged from previous entries; as the name suggests, the key new feature in this entry is 6-player simultaneous matches in both tag-team and battle royal formats.</p>\n<p>Numerous game modes are available: Victory Road is the single-player campaign mode where the player must defeat a series of opponents to win the title belt; One Night Match is a standard exhibition match mode; Open League and One Night Tournament are tournament modes; and Elimination Match, Battle Royal, Death Match, and Gruesome Fighting are all special exhibition match types with specific rules or ring setups. The series' famously robust create-a-wrestler mode also makes an appearance, allowing the player to create completely custom wrestlers in both appearance and move set, which can then be used in any of the other game modes.</p>",

The player has several different weapons to choose from, which have different effectiveness and ammo limits. Certain segments also take the form of a simplified first-person adventure, where the player can explore environments and talk to characters, and there are occasional choices for the player to make which may affect the following action sequence.</p>",

Like previous games in the series, each player controls a Master who can summon various creatures onto the battlefield to fight for them. These creatures can be upgraded and fused to increase their power and evolve them into more advanced forms, are consistent across maps once summoned, and are gone permanently if killed. The goal of each battle is to defeat the opposing master; if a master is killed, all their creatures vanish from the map and they lose the battle.</p>\n<p>In the main story mode, the player selects one of six masters each with different abilities, backstory, and pool of available summon creatures. Over a series of battles on varied maps the player must defeat the other five masters and, ultimately, Gaia himself to claim his throne. There is also a map-select mode where any map can be played outside the story mode, a vs mode for two players, and a map-edit mode.</p>\n<p>A heavily revised PlayStation port which replaces the master characters with more anime-style designs, adds an in-depth story component, and redesigns some of the maps was released the following year as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8476/master-of-monsters-disciples-of-gaia/\">Master of Monsters: Disciples of Gaia</a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Somewhere in the distant reaches of space, there exists a society where magic and technology coexist. In this world, peace is maintained by four great cards representing human emotions \u2014 Joy, Anger, Grief, and Pleasure. However, the Kingdom of Yoshimole, which protects the Card of Joy, has suddenly come under attack by the Rokuna Empire, which holds the Card of Anger, and strange monsters have appeared all over! The Queen of Yoshimole, Bunny Bee, escapes with her two retainers Riki and Alter, and together they must fight back against the Rokuna Empire and save their homeland.</p>\n<p><em>Funky Fantasy</em> is a comedy-fantasy turn-based strategy RPG. Many of the characters and situations are parodies of popular contemporary games and media, and the cast consists of comedians and actors from Yoshimoto Kogyo, the largest comedy talent agency in Japan at the time. Gameplay is similar to titles like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8367/tactics-ogre/\">Tactics Ogre</a> with the player controlling Bunny Bee and a team of fighters on grid-based maps against various opponents. Each turn consists of a Move phase, in which the player can position their units, followed by an Attack phase, where the player can attack enemy units or perform other actions.</p>\n<p>A key feature is that Bunny Bee can summon monsters on the battlefield to fight for her, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/15756/master-of-monsters/\">Master of Monsters</a>.  Each chapter consists of several battle culminating in a boss encounter, and is strictly linear with each battle occurring in order as the often-bizarre story dictates.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ginga Eiy\u016b Densetsu</em> is a strategy simulation game, and part of a long-running series based on Yoshiki Tanaka's <em>Legend of the Galactic Heroes</em> science fiction novels. This console version is most similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/47780/ginga-eiyu-densetsu-iii/\">Ginga Eiy\u016b Densetsu III</a>, with the player taking the role of a top general in either the Galactic Empire or the Free Planets Alliance, commanding an entire fleet of ships. The game is divided into two main sections. In the strategy sections, the player is shown a full-scale map of the conflict, showing planets and the locations of ships; here the player may direct ships to move or engage with enemies, as well as converse with their officers. When battle starts, the player controls their fleet from a top-down perspective in semi realtime; each vessel can be given orders which they will carry out as instructed, but the action can also be paused at any point to issue new orders.</p>",

Not long after, the monster nation of Beaufon advances eastward toward Mais, and in the battle Alexis I loses his life. However, as Zaitan, one of the the Demon Generals of Beaufon, approaches the capital and all seems lost, a mysterious beautiful woman appears and defeats him with an inhuman strength. However, she has no memory of her past; she joins Alexis and Mais to fight against Beaufon and to find the meaning of her own existence, and so begins a fight for the fate of the world.</p>\n<p><em>Terra Phantastica</em> is a turn-based tactical strategy RPG in the vein of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8367/tactics-ogre/\">Tactics Ogre</a>. The main game consists of battle sequences in which the player and the opposing forces commands numerous units around a grid-based map, moving and attacking enemies. Each unit consists of a leader and multiple soldiers, which can be arranged in various formations; soldiers can be lost as a unit is attacked, reducing its effectiveness and eventually eliminating that unit from the battle. Combat engagements between units can take multiple turns, with attacks, retreats, formation changes and other commands available on each turn turns. Between battles the player can consult with various other characters as well as arrange, equip, and train their units. Multiple endings are possible depending on the player's actions and the main character's relationship with Alexis II.</p>",

This console conversion plays similar to the arcade version but includes significant changes and new content. Notably, the cast of boxers, originally consisting of Sega development staff, has largely been replaced with real-life comedians and actors represented by talent agency Yoshimoto Kogyo. This version includes a new \"Champion Mode\" in which the player selects a boxer and must train them to increase their stats by winning bouts. There is also a standard versus mode against either the computer or another player.</p>\n<p>The <em>Plus</em> edition of the game, released several months later, includes the boss characters unlocked to play as by default and has various other minor polish but is otherwise identical to the original release.</p>",

Colored blocks fall in pairs from the top of the screen and must be arranged to match 3 or more of the same color together. Uniquely the entire playfield is at a tilt, causing blocks to slide to one side to fill gaps when they are placed or after clearing other blocks; the player can reverse the tilt at any time, causing blocks to slide in the opposite direction. Combos will launch garbage blocks at the opposing player, and if the blocks reach the top of the well that player loses the round. Each character also has a unique special ability.</p>\n<p>The main single-player story mode casts the player as a young woman named Nina whose sister has been kidnapped by Count Dracula; she must defeat each of Dracula's minions and eventually Dracula himself in order to rescue her.

The star hears him and appears before him to grant his wish, and he's whisked away through a portal to the land of Paneltia, where he must take up a sword and become the hero of this fantastic realm.</p>\n<p><em>Paneltia Story</em> is a Japanese-style RPG with a twist: the world the player explores isn't fixed, but rather is constructed by the player as it is being explored. The player collects various \"panels\" representing different locations and types of terrain from enemies, item boxes, and shops; these can be placed on the map to create new areas to explore and find yet more panels. The game is divided up into stages, with the goal of each stage generally being to build up enough experience and strength to defeat a boss hidden somewhere in the map. Battles are turn-based affairs in the style of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9223/dragon-warrior/\">Dragon Quest</a>, with the player controlling only the lone protagonist.</p>",

The player takes the role of an assistant to the famous detective-novelist-turned-real-detective Fumi Kindaichi, who has come to the remote Amagis\u014d hot springs resort as it celebrates its 60th anniversary. Tensions are high with all of the resort's shareholders present, and it's not long before a body is found. It's up to the player to explore the grounds and solve the mystery, hopefully before anyone else winds up dead. The game's story is presented via live-action photos and video clips, with the player's actions and choices determining how the story proceeds, leading to one of over 30 different endings.</p>",

Forced to flee his home planet, Ovan becomes a mercenary and eventually finds and joins the group responsible for the assassination attempt, hoping to exact his revenge.</p>\n<p><em>QuoVadis 2: Wakusei Ky\u014dsh\u016b Ovan Rei</em> (\"The Ovan Rei Planet Assault\") is a sci-fi realtime strategy game. It is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/208511/quovadis/\">QuoVadis</a>, though the gameplay is completely different and the story is largely unrelated despite taking place in the same universe. The player commands a squad of various primary and support units, with the primary interaction being simply to direct units around the map as they will attack automatically when within range of enemies. Each mission has specific objectives such as taking control of a location or protecting certain units from attack as they travel across the map, and between missions the player can configure the loadout and characteristics of each unit in detail according to the next mission's requirement.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The year is 20XX, and the world has long been in a state of relative peace since the end of World War II. But with the sudden arrival of mysterious UFOs all over the world, that peace has been shattered. The invaders indiscriminately attack the armies of the world, forcing them to either submit or face destruction. A warship called the <em>Ragoh</em>, developed by the Japanese Navy during World War II using alien technology but never put into action before the war ended, is the world's only hope for salvation.</p>\n<p><em>Shin Katei Gunkan: K\u014dtetsu no Kodoku</em> is a sci-fi turn-based war strategy game based on the 1995 anime OVA series known internationally as <em>Super Atragon</em>. It is a hex-based game in the style of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/8227/daisenryaku-series/\">Daisenryaku</a>, including land, air, and sea units but with a focus on naval combat as the player's main unit is a Navy warship. The player commands the <em>Ragoh</em> and its supporting units, assisting international UN forces around the world against the Atlantean invaders. The game is divided into a linear series of missions, and before each mission the player gets advisement from their crew and can adjust their units' stats and loadouts.</p>",

One day, his boss asks him to make an ad for recruiting female employees for the store, hoping that a cute face at the counter might help business. While Kengo is working on the ad on his computer, a cute girl suddenly appears on the screen; this rather flustered and excitable young lady introduces herself as Panic, and before long she appears in the real world and starts working at the video store. However, while she might attract customers, she also attracts trouble, and soon another mysterious lady starts appearing on video screens. Just who are these two girls, and what is their connection?</p>\n<p><em>Panic-chan</em> is a visual-novel style adventure game with a focus on animated sequences; it describes itself as an \"OVA adventure\" and includes 90 minutes of original animation. Most of the game proceeds in a linear format, with each scene playing out through dialogue and animation; there are occasionally choices of which action the protagonist should take, which will branch the story and lead to different scenes.</p>",

While fundamentally quite similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/49982/dezaemon-plus/\">previous release</a> in the series, this Saturn edition includes several notable new features and improvements. The major new feature is the ability to create horizontal shooting games in addition to vertical, and games can now include as many as 10 stages. All the prior tools including the stage, graphic, and music editors are present with improvements, and a new tool allows the user to easily create sprites by manipulating 3D models rather than drawing graphics pixel-by-pixel.</p>\n<p>Included in the package are a total of five sample games, two of which are hidden behind secret codes: <strong>Biometal Gust</strong> and <strong>Vexsarsion Miyabi</strong> demonstrate the horizontal game construction capabilities, while <strong>Ramsie</strong>, <strong>Daioh P!</strong>, and <strong>Elfin</strong> are vertical shooter samples.</p>",

It follows the exploits of middle-schooler Meimi Haneoka, secretly also the master thief and vigilante Saint Tail, who steals illegitimately stolen items to return them to their rightful owners.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is generally split between top-down exploration sections, visual-novel style dialogue sections, and various mini-games such as a falling-block puzzle game. While the exploration sections resemble a traditional Japanese-style RPG, there is no combat or experience points and limited use of items and money. Most of the gameplay consists of exploring the town and talking to other characters; major scenes will switch to a more detailed visual-novel style view that includes illustrations of the characters, with important scenes getting full-screen illustrations. During school events or in place of battle, various mini-games appear, with progression tied to successfully defeating the opponent.</p>",

There is a \"cram school\" mode where the player's skills are first measured, and then the game provides advice and challenges meant to help the player practice their weakest points. There is also a \"tsumeshogi\" shogi puzzle mode with three levels of difficulty, a \"3-on-1\" mode where the player must defeat three different opponents under specific restrictions, and even a \"blind shogi\" mode the player is only shown moves as they are made, and must remember the layout of the board.</p>",

It consists of eight chapters, which each contain an adventure segment and a battle segment. The adventure segments play in standard Japanese adventure style, with the player able to move to different parts of the ship and speak with the various characters via menu commands; a major element is building Akito's relationship with each of 10 different love interests, and if their affection is high enough it's possible to invite them to a date at the ship's virtual room. The battle segments consist of simple ship-to-ship combat, with the player repeating button sequences shown on the screen to launch attacks. The other characters help during these sequences, and their affection level with Akito will also affect their effectiveness in battle.</p>",

The game features a cartoony visual style, and a particularly unique feature is the ability to directly speak with the horses; as cartoon characters, they are able to talk, which lets the player ask them directly about their condition.</p>",

It includes two new original story episodes: the first involves a mysterious group creating a new kind of super-weapon, while the second revolves around the cast preparing chocolates for Valentine's Day. Gameplay is identical to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/222824/maho-shojo-pretty-sammy-osorubeshi-shintai-sokutei-kakubakuhatsu/\">previous title</a>: voiced dialogue sequences over still images drive the story, and the player is occasionally given a choice of which action to take in a scene; these choices will affect how the rest of the scene plays out but not the overall story progression.</p>",

Gameplay is the same as every other entry in the series, with the player visiting locations around campus and challenging other students in hopes of getting saucy photos of them. More impressive mahjong hands will raise a girl's \"Mecha-Moe\" gauge, resulting in more revealing photos the higher it gets, though this console version is censored and does not include any actual nudity. This version also includes a free-battle mode, various game rule options, and new animated opening and ending cutscenes.</p>",

The player selects one of ten nations, and must conquer each continent over a series of maps. The two key features of the game are its focus on streamlined, simplified strategy with only a bare minimum of stats and commands to keep track of, and the large-scale battle scenes where up to 100 units on either side can participate.</p>\n<p>Each turn, the player first collects taxes and pays their army, then can use remaining money to hire additional units and purchase special cards which have helpful effects, such as boosting offensive or defensive strength or summon powerful creatures in battle. The player then has five actions to spend each turn, including moving a squad between locations, strengthening a particular squad's offense or defense, or using one of their cards. Increasing units' levels will increase their strength, and grant a special ability at max level. Each nation has their own set of unit types, and conquering a nation's capital allows the player to add that nation's unique units to their own army.</p>",

It is hosted by famed ghost story presenter <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/1669944/junji-inagawa/\">Junji Inagawa</a> and is a sequel to the first <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/54446/hyaku-monogatari-honto-ni-atta-kowai-hanashi/\">Hyaku Monogatari</a> game. Very similar to the first game, it presents the player with 100 candles, which each represents an individual ghost story for the player to experience.</p>\n<p>Most of the stories are short and non-interactive sound novel sequences; several are presented as video sequences, while a handful include interactive elements where the player explores a location in first-person to move the story forward. The stories are presented in a fixed order, regardless of which candle the player selects, with a few recurring character between them. There are also certain special events that will only occur at particular times of day, usually late at night.</p>",

He decides it's the perfect chance to get to know them, and perhaps even make his move on the girl of his dreams.</p>\n<p><em>Beach de Reach!</em> is a riichi mahjong game combined with a simple love adventure game. The player's affection level with each of the three girls is affected not just by the interactions in the adventure sequences \u2014 the girls will react to the player's choices at specific points, and it is also possible to gift special items which can raise the affection level and trigger special event if the right item is picked for the right girl \u2014 but also by the player's performance in the mahjong sequences. While it's important to show your skills, the best move in mahjong may not be the best move in wooing a girl, and it may sometimes be prudent to let your favored lady win a few rounds here and there.</p>\n<p>In addition to the main story mode, the game also includes a free battle mode with a variety of game rule settings, as well as a \"mahjong school\" quiz mode to test the player's basic knowledge of mahjong.</p>",

Rather than driving a course in real-time, the player instead selects the route to take for each section of track from preset points laid out on a map, keeping in mind race conditions such as the position of other vehicles, tire durability, and remaining fuel. After deciding the route for a section, the choices made play out and the player then plans the next section's route, continuing until completing the race. A real-time replay of the full race is shown once the race is complete. There are a total of 16 different tracks to race.</p>",

The player must decide Hitomi's schedule for each week, both what she should do each day \u2014 train her fighting skills, work a part-time job, attend classes, or simply take a day off to rest \u2014 as well as what her diet should be.</p>\n<p>There are various characters to challenge in battle, though the fights are largely automated with the player's influence limited to telling Hitomi when to guard or use a special move. There is an underground fighting tournament held annually, and the ultimate goal of the game is to train Hitomi to win the tournament within three years.</p>",

The story is simple: Manmaru has been sent by his master to train on his own and hone his ninja skills, and his rivals show up to try and thwart him. The game is broken into six themed stages, which each consists of four areas and a boss fight. Each area is a relatively compact area, and the objective is simply to find and reach the goal while collecting coins and avoiding enemies. Boss fights do not involve direct combat, but are instead various competitive minigames, such as a race to collect more coins than the opponent or to be the first to find the exit to a maze.</p>",

The game starts with the player recruiting each of the band members by visiting various locations around Tokyo; once the group is assembled, the simulation gameplay starts. The player must decide on each member's practice and work schedule for each week, keeping in mind their strengths and energy levels.</p>\n<p>There are 10 different kinds of training, which each affect the eight parameters in various ways, and it's also important to keep drama between band members in check as their personalities will tend to clash. Different parameters improve skill at different jobs, including recording, concerts, and interviews. It is also possible to ask the boys out on dates, which can dramatically improve their motivation levels but may cause drama with their bandmates.</p>",

This conversion of the game retains the same general premise and structure, but makes several major changes; most notably, the game has changed from a real-time progression to turn-based, with the player deciding all their actions and policy changes on a month-by-month basis. This version also completely overhauls the visual style, with an isometric perspective of the city and a new cartoonish look to the characters. It also puts more emphasis on story elements and specific objectives to provide more guidance to the player over the sandbox experience of the original game.</p>",

During conversations, the player can choose what tone to take, between normal, wild, and confident, which will affect that girl's reaction and affection level. The player's stats will affect their chances with each girl, as well as their potential as a pop star, and there is even a rhythm mini-game to help the protagonist practice with his guitar.

However, before the ceremony takes place, a treasure of the kingdom, a priceless jewel integral to the ceremony, has been stolen from the prince's bedroom. The suspect fled into the castle's dungeon, and the prince went after them but has not returned. There are five suspects who do not have an alibi: five beautiful princesses from other countries. The young knight Willow has been summoned to investigate, find the thief, and recover the stolen jewel.</p>\n<p><em>Princess Quest</em> is a first-person dungeon-crawler RPG with love adventure elements. The player controls Willow to investigate the theft, and Willow is also able to magically transform into a female form called Will. Willow and Will have different combat abilities, with Willow adept at physical attacks while Will excels at magic, and during the investigation some characters will only be willing to speak openly to one form or the other. The player can return to Willow's room in the castle to switch forms.</p>\n<p>The player can explore the castle and surrounding town from a top-down perspective to speak with other characters and obtain clues and information. The dungeons are explored in first-person with up to two of the princesses accompanying the player. Only Willow/Will participates directly in the turn-based combat, while the other two characters provide special abilities to help the player.</p>\n<p>The first-print limited edition of the game includes a set of three trading cards but is otherwise identical.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Shadows of the Tusk</em> is a multiplayer deck-building strategy game. Players take turns summoning creatures to fight for them, and giving them orders to attack the opposing player. Each player has a deck of cards which each represent a specific creature or character, and a pool of 30 mana with which to summon creatures or perform actions. Each character has specific stats and abilities, with stronger characters generally requiring more mana to summon or use their skills. Mana can be replenished by placing creatures on certain tiles, and the goal of each match is to defeat the opponent's leader.</p>\n<p>The game includes several modes. The story mode includes eight stages which each unlocks additional cards for the player's deck, and functionally acts as a tutorial. <strong>Practice</strong> mode lets the player try out new decks, while *<em>Ante</em>\" mode lets the player wager their cards in a match against the computer to acquire new cards. There is also a two-player versus mode with both local play and network play via the XBand service. There are 40 total cards to collect and up to eight different decks can be saved.</p>",

The player drops individual colored creatures into a well, and if three of the same color touch, they will be cleared and vanish; creatures above will fall to take their place, and chain combos will launch garbage block attacks at the other player. Clearing blocks also fills a meter, which can be used to cancel out incoming attacks. Clear capsule blocks also occasionally appear; these will capture whichever creature they land on, feeding it to the player's monster, which will upgrade the player's monster after the match and lead to various evolutionary forms which result in various garbage drop patterns.</p>\n<p>The game includes a single-player story mode, as well as a two-player versus mode; only the story mode includes the monster-raising elements.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Nao Katsuragi is a popular idol, but scandal breaks out after a photo surfaces of a late-night meeting between her and Shinya Tatsumi, the son of the president of her talent agency. The ensuing media frenzy leads to both Shinya, and Nao's manager Yui Tachibana, committing suicide, and Nao herself disappears shortly thereafter. The whole scandal however was a setup meant to frame Nao and destroy her reputation.</p>\n<p><em>Kindaichi Sh\u014dnen no Jikenbo: Hoshimit\u014d Kanashimi no Fukush\u016bki</em> is a crime adventure game based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/11302/kindaichi-case-files-kindaichi-shonen-no-jikenbo-licensees/\">Kindaichi Case Files</a> manga and anime franchise. Unlike other games based on the property, the player does not control Kindaichi; rather, each of the two scenarios tasks the player with committing a \"perfect crime\" without being caught by Kindaichi. The first scenario casts the player as Nao Katsuragi, who wants revenge on whoever framed her and left two innocent people dead; the second casts the player as Takuya Asagiri, who was engaged to Yui and wants revenge on those who took his fiancee from him.</p>\n<p>The game consists primarily of visual novel-style adventure sequences, with the player regularly given choice prompts for how to respond or proceed in the given situation. There are also occasional action stealth sequences where the player must avoid detection. The slightest inconsistency or suspicious action will likely lead Kindaichi to discover your plot, leading to a game over. Getting arrested, killed, or even just failing to commit the crime at all will also result in a game over.</p>",

Races have a field of 9 competitors and take place on tracks either 333m, 400m, or 500m in length.</p>\n<p>The game includes a single race mode for up to four human players against the computer, a basic career mode, a watch mode, and a database of information on real-life keirin tracks. It was a promotional item given away at Keirin events related to the sport's 50th anniversary in 1998, and was never sold at retail.</p>",

The main story mode includes two different scenarios: a middle-school scenario where only kart racing on a closed track is available, and there are three girls to pursue; and a much deeper high-school scenario which includes street racing across eight tracks, car tuning options, and eight different girls as potential romantic interests.</p>\n<p>The simulation elements progress largely automatically but can be interrupted at any time to perform specific actions, such as to call one of the girls, go shopping for car parts or clothes, or enter a race. The player's stats will change and grow as the game progresses, which affects which characters they'll be able to meet and what events are available. The player can also take part time jobs (presented as short mini-games) to earn cash for upgrading their car. The game also includes a free race mode for one or two players.</p>",

In each turn, the player is able to act with each of their party members to move, attack, or use items or special techniques; after all characters have acted, the computer then takes a turn to do the same, repeating until one side is defeated. The game is broken into a total of 16 chapters, and has a specific focus on the bonds between characters. Characters can team up for combination attacks, which pools their strength together and can result in additional combat effects and even special story events involving those characters.</p>",
