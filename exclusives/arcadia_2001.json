It is exclusive to the Bandai Arcadia, a variant of the Emerson Arcadia 2001 that was only available in Japan.</p>\n<p>The player controls protagonist Arale-chan, as she attempts to prevent the alien King Nikochan and his servant from building a UFO out of car parts. By yelling at the two aliens, she can knock the aliens down and retrieve the stolen car parts. Arale-chan frequently runs out of Robovita-A fuel, however, and must recharge with a teapot that appears periodically.</p>\n<p>Once the aliens have successfully carried five car parts to the launching pad at the top of the screen, they will finish building their UFO and will attempt to fly away. If Arale-chan can hit them with her \"N'cha Cannon\" yell, they will crash, and the player will receive many bonus points.</p>\n<p>The game features two modes. In Level 1, the characters move slowly, while Level 2 features a faster speed. The player has three lives and must try to score as many points as possible. If the UFO successfully flies away, the player loses a life.</p>",

Enemy ships will shoot at your drone and attempt to blow it up. If this happens, you can launch a new drone with no penalty, but it wastes time to do so. You can also continue to control your \"mother ship\" (the one that launches the drones), and use your lasers to shoot down the enemy ships, but this only gives additional points, as the enemy ships are also immediately replaced.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Space Attack</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8806/space-invaders/\">Space Invaders</a>-style shooter where players control a missile launcher defending against waves of enemy spaceships.</p>\n<p>The player moves their launcher left and right at the bottom of the screen, avoiding incoming rockets and enemy ships while shooting them down with the action button. The game presents six rows of enemy ships that move and fire, with some ships occasionally flying directly at the player's launcher. Players start with three lives (missile launchers), and the game ends when all lives are lost, though an extra life is awarded for every 5,000 points scored.</p>\n<p>Scoring in the game varies based on the enemy ships' positions and behavior. Stationary ships in the lower rows are worth 30 points, while those in the top row are worth 60 points. However, ships flying towards the player's launcher become more valuable targets, ranging from 60 points for the bottom rows to 200 points for the top row. As waves of enemies are cleared, new squadrons appear to challenge the player. This game clearly draws heavy inspiration from the arcade classic Space Invaders, adapting the format for home console play on the Arcadia 2001 with some variations in enemy behavior and scoring mechanics.</p>",

A 14x5 rectangular formation of enemy spacecraft appears from the top of the screen, and slowly gets closer to the surface of the Earth. You control a mobile missile launcher that can shoot up at the invaders, while the aliens try to bomb you. As in Space Invaders, there are fortifications which can give you some shelter from the bombs, and these are slowly worn away as they are bombarded. There is also an enemy mother-ship that appears overhead, which gives you bonus points. But unlike Space Invaders, there is only one wave. Once the main enemy formation is defeated, you can only gain more points by aiming at the mother-ships until the five minute timer runs out.</p>",

When it is your turn, you are shown both a side-view of the lane as well as a view of the pins. The controls allow you to position yourself across the lane, then when ready, to step towards the foul line and release the ball towards your targets. On release, you may choose to hook the ball to the left or right. Stepping across the foul line results in a zero score for that throw. Otherwise, you will see the ball travel up the lane, and then switch to an \"expanded view\" of the pins as the ball arrives. Pins are reset after each strike, and if there are no pins standing after the second throw, you are awarded a bonus throw, allowing up to 30 points per frame for a total of 10 frames. There are both one and two player game options.</p>",

        "description": "<p>3D Soccer is a two-player only sports game for the Emerson Arcadia and compatible consoles. Each team is represented by a group of four footballers (less than the 11 for real-life soccer) scattered around the field. The two teams are differently coloured: white and blue. The nearest player to the ball from each team is highlighted as yellow or black, and you can only control this player. Game play involves collecting the ball with your player, dribbling it towards the goal at your end of the field (or preventing your opponent from doing the same) and then kicking the ball into the net.</p>\n<p>The game uses simplified rules where kicking the ball off the side of the field just causes it to bounce back, with play continuing. Kicking the ball over the top of the goal will return play to the centre of the field.  The game is played with 45 simulated minute halves (actual time is about 10 times faster). At the end of the first half the teams switch ends. The aim is to have scored more goals than your opponent by the end of the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Crazy Gobbler</em> is a Pac-Man variant.  Players take control of the entity known as the Gobbler and are tasked with gobbling all the beans in a maze before the three monsters roaming around gobble the Gobbler. If the Gobbler eats one of the vitamins found in the playfield, the player has a small window of time to direct the Gobbler to munch on the monsters. Occasionally an apple will appear which will earn the player extra points when eaten.</p>\n<p>To avoid legal issues, the game featured some graphical and gameplay alteration for its US release as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/28056/cat-trax/\">Cat Trax</a> to become a slightly less direct variant of <em>Pac-Man</em>.</p>",
