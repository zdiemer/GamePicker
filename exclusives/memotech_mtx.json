In the game Phaid is a planet located in Galaxy 29 and the player is one of its inhabitants. As a commander in the planet's space fleet the player has to protect it from attacks from mutant aliens from a neighbouring planet. Like with other shoot 'em ups from the era the player moves his MTX Space Fighter left and right across the screen and shoots at the alien invaders above him. The aliens move back and forth in a fixed formation but individuals will fly closer and attack the player from close range. These are harder to hit and are therefore worth more points. In addition to the regular aliens there are also <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a>-esque saucers that occasionally moves across the top of the screen. Once the screen has been cleared of aliens another wave will appear and the difficulty will increase.</p>",

It's an action game played from an isometric perspective where the player has to move his chubby character over all the blocks of a pyramid. The character moves by diagonally jumping from block to block. This causes the block to change colour and when they are all of the desired colour the level is completed. Starting at level 2 the player sometimes have to move over the same block multiple times to get the right colour. At the same time the player has to watch out for a ball that bounces around the pyramid. Making contact with it or jumping off the pyramid means the player will lose a life and the level will be restarted. The player will also come across bouncing whirlies that will give bonus points upon contact. The game is over when all four lives are lost.</p>",

The player's task is to guide the titular tapeworm through a maze and collect all the pips that lies scattered around. As the tapeworm eats, it's length increases and the player has to prevent it from crashing into its own tail or any of the walls of the maze. After a crash the player loses one (out of three) lives and has to restart the maze. A level is completed once all pips have been eaten and the player will move on to the next one that has the same maze layout but where the tapeworm will grow faster. The starting level (1-9) can be selected before playing. At times cherries will appear in the middle of the maze and these are worth bonus points when collected.</p>",

At the top of the screen, a scanner is located for tracking actions that are outside the player's view. \nIn the beginning, there are two types of enemies, one of which is able to kidnap humanoids. If successful, a humanoid is transformed into another type of enemy. Other aliens may appear after the player is able to defeat the first waves of attackers. Aside from a standard shot, it's also possible to use a smart bomb which clears the screen.</p>",

As the title makes clear his task is to leave the planet and to so he has to collect all pieces of his space ship that lies scattered around the planet. There are 100 parts in total and the game consists of 70 screens. Various enemies will come into Albert's path and these have to be avoided since touching them leads to a life lost. A life is also lost when running out of strength which happens gradually. To recharge some strength it's possible to pick up and eat bananas. Albert starts out with ten lives and game ends when they are all lost. Controls are limited to moving around and jumping as well as climbing stairs while there is no way to attack enemies.</p>",

As such it is played from a third person perspective where the player's craft is automatically moving forward while the player can move left and right as well as up and down. Like the arcade game it is based on, the game is split into different sections with different screen layouts</p>\n<p>First the player has to fly between pairs of towers and shoot down hoppers on an open plain. When a certain quota of hoppers have been destroyed the game moves on to the second stage where the player follows an arched pathway and has to shoot aliens that guards the path. The third stage is inspired by the death star in Star Wars and takes place in a trench. The final stage is a warp tunnel where the player has to defeat alien fighters. After completing all stages the game cycles through the stages at a higher difficulty level. There are in total eight levels.</p>",

Initially there are just drones which appear as eggs before they start moving around the maze. Other enemies are neutron runners that home in on the player, gamma tracers that are harmless but drop bombs whose blast is lethal and geddon riders which will explode and kill the player if not destroyed quickly enough.

While exploring the mines the player has to avoid ghosts and fireballs since any contact with these will lead to a lost life. A life is also lost when getting hit by a lift or an ore cart, when falling down a shaft and when a certain score hasn't been reached when time runs out. The amount of time left is hidden from the player. Unlike the arcade game, the pick axe can not be used to knock out the enemies.</p>",

The game retains most aspects of the original arcade game and has the player moving left and right down the bottom of the screen while trying to shoot down the alien invaders that move back and forth above. There are three kinds of aliens (evil lurchers, wicked ogres and swamp vipers) each worth different point values and they fire a large amount of projectiles that the player has to dodge. Like in the arcade game barriers offer some protection and there is a mother ship moving past at the top of the screen. One difference is that the mother ship here shoots fast moving missiles. The player has three lives and is given an extra one at 1000 points.</p>",
