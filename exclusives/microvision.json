        "description": "<p><em>Alien Raiders</em> is one of the two Microvision games released in 1981. It is a fast-paced action game set in space where the player fights alien raiders to prevent them from landing. Originally designed as a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a> game, Milton Bradley did not like the licensing deal and altered the game to make it have different gameplay.</p>\n<p>Alien raiders appear at the top of the screen and move horizontally from the right to the left, towards the player's landing area. The player can manipulate a firing beam. It consists of a single square that moves vertically at the left side of the screen automatically and at a fixed speed. The player cannot exercise any influence over the speed. By pressing one of the three buttons labelled with an arrow and the word \"fire\", the firing beam is activated. It extends to the right and can take out raiders when the player carefully times both the horizontal and the vertical position. Raiders can however only be hit when the tip of the beam is directly on top of a raider or on the square immediately to the left of it. To determine the distance of the firing beam, a control knob at the bottom of the device needs to be manipulated. Turning the knob clockwise lengthens it, turning it counter-clockwise makes it shorter.</p>\n<p>The player only has a limited amount of fuel and firing the beam depletes it. It uses less fuel when it is fired when a raider is nearby, but that allows the raiders to approach towards the landing area and leads to a higher risk. The final goal is to get a score a high as possible before the raiders reach the landing area or all fuel is gone. Since some raiders have different speed, it is also possible to wait until two of them overlap and take them out with a single shot for an economic use of fuel and twice the regular amount of points. It is possible to hold down the fire button as a last resort to take down many raiders at once, but this costs large amounts of fuel.</p>\n<p>Two types of games are available. In Game 1 four raiders appear - three slow ones and a fast one - and three points are awarded per defeated ship. As soon as a raider is destroyed, a new one appears. Game 2 is similar with four raiders at the start, but more raiders appear simultaneously after a while (up to five or six at a time), they gradually become faster and they are worth more points over time. In Game 1 there are 150 units of fuel at the start with a 120 unit bonus after every eighth raider shot down. In Game 2 the player starts with 75 units and receives 60 bonus units for every eighth raider. The amount of fuel that can be held is capped at 255 units. Next to the two types of games two skill levels can be chosen. These only influence the speed of the raiders.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Despite the extremely limited resources of the Microvision, and the small 16x16 pixel screen, <em>Sea Duel</em> is designed to be a complex naval battle title. The basic object of the game seems simple enough: out-maneuver the enemy ship and score six or more points (hits) against it. </p>\n<p>The game can be played by one or two players, alternating, or one player against the computer. Battles always feature a battleship against a submarine, and on the Game Selection screen, the image on the right is the submarine. Here, the player character is depicted with a symbol like a man, and the computer as a big letter C. Fuel and ammo must both be monitored. The battleship is represented by a 3-pixel-long straight line and the submarine by a single pixel. </p>\n<p>The games take place in a series of rounds, and each round concludes with an update of the score. Moves are input by both parties, then the action plays out onscreen. For instance, the player will input strategic move and attack commands, then the second player will input commands. Each player may input two combinations of movement and ammunition commands per turn. For instance, move in two directions and fire in two directions, or move in one direction, fire in one direction, move in another direction, fire in another direction. The input commands then play out onscreen, and any successful hits are recorded. </p>\n<p>Using the Skill/Score button, players may select two different difficulty modes, either to have 12 units of fuel and 12 units of ammunition, or 18 of each. The computer has unlimited of both. <em>Sea Duel</em> features one of the more complex control layouts in the Microvision library, including movement buttons for four directions, attack buttons for four directions, Game, Go, Skill/Score, and Clear buttons.</p>",

Three arrow buttons are present on the cartridge face for shooting diagonally left, right, or straight up. </p>\n<p>Players may choose the size of the targets (ships represented by a line of pixels onscreen) as 4, 3, 2, 1, or C, which stands for Changeable. Speeds are Fast, Slow, or Changeable. The Targets button allows players to select a number of ships from 1 to 9. These numbers are multiplied by 10, so selecting 3 will give players 30 targets.

As such, <em>Block Buster</em> came packed in the same box with the Microvision system, and was intended to show off the strengths of the system. Since the Microvision came with a built in rotating paddle controller, <em>Block Buster</em> works specifically with this control input. </p>\n<p><em>Block Buster</em> is, as its core, simply a clone of the classic Atari 2600 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9001/breakout/\">Breakout</a>. Players use the paddle knob to move a paddle left and right along the bottom of the gameplay screen to bounce a ball against blocks at the top with the goal of clearing as many blocks as possible. </p>\n<p>There are two speeds selectable with the Speed button, and the Paddle button selects the sizes of the paddle as either \"Double\" or \"Triple.\" Triple is a paddle three pixels wide. The ball must be served by pressing the Go button. The Go button also navigates through the brief menu system and score screens.</p>",

The second game is called <em>Lights Out</em> and is similar to the titles <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/60267/lights-out/\">Tiger Game.com</a> game of the same name. In it, there are a series of squares onscreen representing lights, and players must put all the lights out.

The gameplay screen is a 3x3 grid, and each numeric button affects nearby sections. The grid is set up as follows: </p>\n<p>1 2 3</p>\n<p>4 5 6</p>\n<p>7 8 9</p>\n<p>Selecting 1 activates spaces 1, 2, 4, and 5, and likewise for the other corner points. Selecting 2 or 8 also activates the spaces to the left and right of these points. Selecting 4 or 6 activate the spaces above and below as well. Selecting 5 activates the most spaces in the shape of a + sign. For example, if the gameplay screen has spaces 2, 3, and 6 highlighted and the player selects space 3, spaces 2, 3, and 6 will deactivate but space 5 will activate and so on. The game is won when all target blocks are surrounded in <em>Rings</em>, or when all lights have been deactivated in <em>Lights Out</em>.</p>",

The game ends when the bank is broken (with a score of more than 999 points) or when the player's score reaches zero.</li>\n<li><b>Double Dare:</b> A two-player, turn-based game in which the first player to score 100 points wins. Players may spin as many times as they wish on a given turn, but getting one bar ends the turn and two bars forfeits all points scored during that turn.</li>\n<li><b>Take It or Leave It:</b> Another two-player, turn-based game, in which 200 points is required to win. On the first spin, only the left and right reels spin. Players can take a 5-point payoff for a matching pair, or decide to spin the center reel to obtain a pair or triple match at the cost of a 1-point deduction.</li>\n</ol>",
