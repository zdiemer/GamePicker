The player has four X-Men to work with - Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm and Rogue. More characters gradually become available to use as they are unlocked during play. The player earns special points that can be used to enhance the characters' strength, vitality, and mutant power capabilities. A constantly growing power meter allows the heroes to unleash devastating mutant attacks than can kill several enemies at once.</p>\n<p>The game includes two-player simultaneous gameplay mode; the player can also take on three friends in the Versus modes, including Capture the Flag and Deathmatch options.</p>",

Only the fire power of Spyro, with Hunter and Sparx on hand to help, can save the fairies from a certain Panadol future. </p>\n<p>Unlike the Playstation series, <em>Seasons of Ice</em> has the player controlling Spyro through an isometric overhead camera. However, all of Spyro's skills are still available to use, including his flame breath and glide. And the flying bonus levels (similar to that of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/584/sonic-the-hedgehog-universe/\">Sonic series</a> of bonus levels) make use of the Mode 7 technology in order to create the 3D like perspective (as used in <em>Mario Kart: Super Circuit</em> and <em>F-Zero: Maximum Velocity</em>).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Alienators: Evolution Continues</em> is a side-scrolling action game based on the animated TV show of the same name. The player takes the role of the captain of the Alienator team, Ira, and has to free a research lab from mutated creatures.</p>\n<p>The twelve levels are not linear but mazes which have to be explored to reach the objectives; there is also a fair share of keycard hunting. The player defends his skin by shooting the aliens with his standard weapon (which has unlimited ammo), or with more powerful special weapons. Those have their unique ammo types, which have to be found during the course of the game - this means it is wise to save some ammo in case one of the eight bosses shows up. Of course additional characters from the TV series also make an appearance, either as friend or foe.</p>",

This time Cortex has shrunk the world down to a tiny size and it is up to Crash to explore the 20 levels full of dangerous creatures and terrain to collect crystals that will (hopefully) change the world back to its normal size.</p>\n<p>Crash explores 4 worlds, split into 5 levels. Levels range from side-scrolling action to underwater swimming and 3D chase sequences (similar to those in the original Playstation series) designed using the GBA's unique FX features to create a 3D illusion. You will also play flying shoot 'em up levels, a boss levels at the end of each world, and the usual extra bonus levels and secret items.</p>",

Along the paths are pieces of DNA. The task for each level is to collect enough DNA to open the exit at the end, opening the second part of the game, Dinosaur Creation. </p>\n<p>With the DNA you have collected, you must match them together correctly to create 10 different species of dinosaur. As you reach further into the game, the harder it becomes to correctly match the DNA samples.</p>",

As you enter the story of <em>Episode II: Attack of the Clones</em>, you will control Anakin and Obi-Wan in their quest to find the bounty hunter(s) who wish to see the Senator dead.</p>\n<p>The game follows the script of the movie very closely, allowing you to visit the likes of Kamino, where Jango Fett hides along with the waiting Clone Army, as well as Geonosis, where the final battle takes place.</p>\n<p>You will also have an opportunity to control Mace Windu, fly a speeder in a 1st person perspective race mode, and use the force powers of the three Jedi to defeat the many enemies. Most of the game takes place in a side-scrolling, platform view, as well as some 1st person levels using the GBA's advanced semi-3D technology (as seen in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1068/doom/\">Doom</a>).</p>",

The game tells the story of Ecks, an ex-FBI Agent whose orders are to hunt down the beautiful assassin named Sever. As the cat-and-mouse-hunt progresses, both agents will find out that they are mere pawns in a larger government conspiracy...</p>\n<p>In the Single Player mode, the player can choose wether he wants to play as Ecks or Sever. The choice makes a radical difference in the single-player campaign. As Ecks, your orders are to chase Sever, whilst as Sever, you have to evade him. The levels for both characters tend to be the same, but with different objectives, and different locations for both characters. </p>\n<p>As an example, the orders of Sever are to hunt down and kill a government agent whilst as Ecks, your orders are to prevent the assassination. During this level, both characters will encounter each other. As Ecks, you'll have to try and snipe Sever whilst evading her grenades. When you play this level as Sever, you'll have to throw grenades at Ecks, whilst avoiding his sniper fire.</p>\n<p>The game also has a multi-player mode for up to 4 players with three different modes, which are Deathmatch (Every man for himself), Assassination (one player is the assassin who has to hunt down the VIP who's being protected by bodyguards) and Bomb kit (Try to gather all parts of a bomb before the other players do).</p>",

Along the way she'll meet enemies both human and otherwise and will also have to deal with dark magic of sorts.</p>\n<p>Lara is now in a \"quasi-3D\" overhead environment, as opposed to the 2D-platformer view of the previous handheld (GBC) versions. This view proves helpful while Lara runs, jumps, shimmys, and shoots around.

The gold also works as an indicator to see how much of a level has actually been explored. Fievel can jump on enemies and throw his hat in a boomerang fashion.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Eye of the Beholder</em> is a classic dungeon crawler that challenges the player to lead a party of adventurers on a quest for fame and fortune in a world based on <em>Forgotten Realms</em>, a <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> universe. </p>\n<p>The party will scour the dark underbelly of Waterdeep for an evil source of power that threatens the streets above. Nary an hero would dare step into these dungeons alone, so the player must create a party of up to six adventurers from four base classes (Wizard, Rogue, Cleric and Fighter) and seven races (Human, Half-Elf, Half-Orc, Moon Elf, Lightfoot Halfling, Rock Gnome and Shield Dwarf). All are based on character types from the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd Edition</em> license. </p>\n<p>The first-person view draws the player into the role of adventurer. A handy auto-map feature helps to navigate the complex mazes of slime-covered walls and hidden passages. For the turn-based battles, the view switches to an isometric overhead perspective. Each character can be assigned commands for moving, attacking and spell-casting. Characters can also learn over 100 unique skills, feats, and spells that are straight out of the <em>Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition</em> rules. </p>\n<p>As with all RPGs, success depends on constantly upgrading equipment, assigning new spells and reordering the group. Over 100 items, both magical and ordinary will keep the player adventuring for hours.</p>",

To find them, you must complete certain elements of each of the games modes. These include the basic Survival Mode, where you must remove as many gems from the playing field as possible; Versus Mode has you battling a range of thieves in one-on-one Columns games; and Flash Columns has you attempting to remove the flashing gem from an already packed field of gems in a limited amount of time.</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is simple. In the style of Tetris, the playing field fills up with magic gems, each of varying colour. Match 3 or more of the gems and they will disappear. The more you remove in Survival mode, the higher your end ranking becomes.</p>\n<p>The magic gems themselves can be found by defeating the thieves in VS mode, getting as far as possible in Survival mode (and collecting as high a ranking as possible) or completing Flash Columns mode.</p>",

The player controls a young boy destined to be the greatest duelist of all time. The protagonist starts with one of the three starter card decks, and proceeds to challenge and battle duelists in five different levels. Cards represent various monsters, which have their own statistics, strength, and weaknesses, and are used strategically during the turn-based battles. The game keeps track of the time passed: battling a duel will usually advance the calendar one day forward. Should the protagonist survive for long enough time, he will be able to participate in bigger tournaments. New cards, deck combinations, and booster packs can be acquired as well.</p>",

Players passively build up power over the course of the game to unleash special pitches, hits, or fielding tricks. A pitcher can throw a fireball, the batter can change their bat's shape to have a better chance of hitting the ball, and fielders can magnetize the ball towards their glove to get a hand on it faster. Playable in a customizable League format, single game exhibitions, and a Home Run Derby mode, Crushed Baseball offers many expected baseball staples as well as the ability to create your own players.\u00a0 In addition, Crushed Baseball offer five fully playable female players and 10 original team mascots including a ram, an eagle and a bear.\u00a0 </p>",

After completing two tests set up by Agent Gibbons, Xander is set on a real mission. His target is Anarchy 99, the deadliest crime syndicate since the mafia took over New York. They've got biological weapons and a terrorist agenda; the new agent has got firepower and attitude to sabotage their stockpile of terrorist missiles, bombs and biochemical weaponry. </p>\n<p>Based on the feature film of the same name, <em>xXx</em> is a side-scrolling shooter with extensive platform elements and driving levels. During the side-scrolling stages, Xander will deal with his enemies using a variety of firearms, such as AK-47, shotgun, and others; he can also use grenades for a more devastating effect. However, there are also many traps laid on his way, such as mines, trip wires, etc. Running and jumping on platforms is also a common activity in the game. Power-ups and health kits can be found to help the secret agent survive.</p>\n<p>The driving levels play similarly to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Road+Rash\">Road Rash</a>; Xander rides a bike, trying to avoid obstacles, and deals with his enemies by kicking them off their bikes, pushing them towards other cars and crashing them, etc.</p>",

Search out the various levels for the evil inside, and destroy the immortal that rules the area to complete the level.</p>\n<p>This isometric platformer does not have you fighting evil with the usual assortment of weapons and devices, but it will have you playing outdoors. The inbuilt sunlight sensor on the cartridge detects levels of sunlight, which determines not only the time of day you play, but also acts as ammo for your weapon. Run out of sunlight, or play in the dark, and evil will have the upperhand.</p>\n<p>Many elements to the sunlight can have an effect on how the game plays out. For example, you can only replenish ammo during play by standing outside or, if indoors, under light from a window. Sunlight batteries can be collected during play to store sunlight, so you can play at night.</p>",

Playing out like a Bruce Lee movie, you can pull off all the famous moves that made Bruce Lee a star of the action genre between cut scenes that tell the compelling story, and fights set in original, yet familiar, landmarks.</p>\n<p>The side-scroller will have you fighting various enemies from left, right, above and below. Explore each level for various weapons, while completing tasks to complete the level (such as finding a certain amount of keys or rescuing hostages to defeating every enemy that is thrown at you). Use Bruce Lee's abilities to flipkick up ledges to higher ground or flip characters over your shoulder to knock out those behind you.</p>",

In order for the park to be opened, it's up to Mickey, Minnie, Donald and Daisy to find the magical power and return the park back to the way it was.</p>\n<p>In order to do this, the gang must move along the game board and complete various challenges. Game length can be set between one and four days (i.e. boards to complete). Players take turns to roll the dice and move their character. Landing on blue spaces adds magical power, while red spaces remove it. Green spaces are special and might contain one-time use items (like double dice or six- or twelve-space move cards), allow one to warp to another space, roll again, force skipping a turn, turn blue into red spaces, et cetera. One particular park attraction is always the current goal. The player who reaches it first is awarded magical power, a crystal and must then complete a side-scrolling platform challenge, beating or avoiding enemies and collecting stars, all while looking for the exit before time runs out. Completing an attraction awards the player with more magical power (depending on the number of stars collected) and possibly a pet. Pets can also be bought in store spaces by trading in crystals. Pets increase magical power, and each pet has a unique power that can be used by its owner, like increasing movement rate. </p>\n<p>A board is completed after 12 turns. The player that collected the most power is declared the day's winner. When all boards in the game are done, a boss battle follows. If more than one players play, the one with the most collected power overall fights the boss.</p>\n<p>There are four different boards, each with their own theme. Up to four players can play the main game using one GBA, or play with four linked handhelds to challenge each other in a set of unlockable mini-games. The side-scrolling attraction levels can also be unlocked for play from the main menu.</p>",

To obtain these cards, you must battle various people around the city.  As you battle the duelists, you have the opportunity to gain new cards (if you win), or lose cards (if you lose).  There is also a card shop if you want to buy cards rather than using only what you get from antes.</p>\n<p>The battles are played just like the in trading card game.  You use your cards' effects and strengths to defeat the other players' cards.  By lowering their life points to 0, you will defeat them.</p>\n<p>A feature in this game is your duelist level.  Cards have certain levels on them.  If your duelist level is below that number, you cannot have that card in your deck.  This is a new feature not seen in previous games.  This feature keeps you from just buying all the best cards at the start and having an easy time for the rest of the game.  By winning duels, you will gain in level quickly enough to start using some of the better cards, though it will still take some time to be able to use the best cards.</p>\n<p>Can you get into the tournament and win the 3 Egyptian God cards?  Yu-Gi-Oh and his friends are also trying to get into the tournament. So you'll have to beat them in the tournament to win everything. The game features over 900 cards and over 100 duelists.</p>",

Various weapons are on offer to dispatch the guys (or gals) standing in your way, and by using bullet time, you can slow down time and increase your chances of both avoiding incoming fire and hitting the target.</p>",

Rather than being 3D side-scrolling, this game employs a 3D isometric view- not a static, sprite-based field though, it is comprised of actual texture-mapped polygons.  The character sprites are 2D though, and while you think it wouldn't work- it does :P</p>\n<p>You can have 9 characters to choose from, 5 modes of play; Story, Battle, Challenge, Training, and Mini Games; you can link up 4 GBA's to fight your friends, each character has a bunch of moves you can use to beat the you-know-what out of whoever you're fighting.  It has a system of selecting Aerial, Ground, and Guard based attacks, and depending on what type of attack you set for which area (aerial/ground/guard), you have a possibility of 9 total different special attacks to choose from (only 3 at a time in a match though) which you can change each time you lose 1 stock point.</p>\n<p>Among the other many features, Sonic Team has also made the game more dynamic with the addition of a trainable character whose abilities and techniques you can raise and add to.  You get to pick and choose every aspect of the robot's style (running, attacking, jumping, dashing, etc etc etc etc etc).</p>\n<p>The game takes a moderate amount of time to play through as all the characters, and adds a longer lifespan to itself if you wish to play through and beat it completely (all characters, get all moves for the trainable robot, etc).</p>",

Aside from the main campaign, <em>Tactics Ogre</em> also offers a vs mode and Quest mode, in which the player must complete objectives they set themselves within a certain number of turns to earn rare items that can be used in the campaign mode. Finally, there is also an option to exchange characters and items between players with a link cable.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Worldwide Edition: Stairway to the Destined Duel</em> allows you to battle others with your Yu-Gi-Oh! deck. You choose to move to the next area or stay in your current area of the map and battle whoever is there.</p>\n<p>When you are in the map mode, you have the option of staying where you are and battling anyone in your area who will battle, or moving to an area adjacent to your own. To help you decide what to do, the map will show you the people in your space and the spaces around your space. Depending on what is shown to you, you can easily tell if each person wants to talk to you or battle you. If you have not battled a person yet, you will not be able to see who they are until you choose to battle them (except with a small number of people you already know to start the game).</p>\n<p>Each week you can get 5 more cards through a magazine that you are given. If you choose to, you can add these to your deck right away. Otherwise, you can leave them in your trunk to be added later.</p>\n<p>Each weekend, you can participate in a tournament if you're in the right location that weekend to do so. Winning the tournaments can gain you some new cards by opening up new (locked) booster packs of cards that you can choose from when you win battles.</p>\n<p>As you get more cards, Duelist Points, or just win many times against a single opponent, you will also open up more booster packs to choose from when winning duels.</p>\n<p>The game also allows for dueling friends using a link cable, or even trading cards with friends.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Monster Rancher Advance</em> is a monster-raising simulation that allows players to raise and customize 440 monster types. These monsters can then be tested in in-game tournaments, or made battle against other players's ones in two-player mode (by the GBA link cable). </p>\n<p>Monsters are created in the game's shrine through the entry of letters, numbers and punctuation symbols. Players begin with the ability to enter up to 4 characters to make monsters, and can unlock the ability to use up to 8 characters through gaining higher trainer ranks. Different words or combinations of characters can not only make different types of monsters, but also each monster can have varying attributes and characteristics, making each one unique.</p>\n<p>Players then train the monsters by choosing which foods to feed them with, which drills to do to raise attributes, what training to send them to for learning new attacks, and what items to give them. The game starts with a modest amount of money with which food and items can be purchased; more money is earned in tournaments. Gameplay revolves around planning training sessions, adding new attacks and juggling the bank account, along with attempting to win tournaments. As monsters age, they can be added to a coaching staff to help raise new monsters to better attributes, or they can be combined with other monsters to make stronger babies. Monsters do not die in this game, however they do face an enforced retirement age.</p>\n<p>There is a storyline, where some characters from older <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/477/monster-rancher-series/\">Monster Rancher</a> games are back, and new characters are introduced. The gameplay itself, like most other <em>Monster Rancher</em> games, is open-ended.</p>\n<p>The two-player mode, requiring the link cable and two copies of the game, allows players to test the monsters they have raised against each other. It also allows players to trade items and cash money, to wager items or cash on tournaments, and trade raised monsters bringing them into each others' game files.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Monster Rancher Advance 2 is a monster raising sim where players can raise, battle, explore with any of 512 monsters. While it is the second Monster Rancher game on the Game Boy Advance system, it is not a true sequel, and does not require any knowledge of any other ranching games to play.</p>\n<p>Players make monsters by entering letters, numbers, and punctuation characters into the in-game shrine. At the start, players have access to up to 4 spaces to enter words or characters. As they improve their rank as a trainer, they can access more spaces, up to a maximum of 8. Players may also bring monsters into the game from their Monster Rancher Advance game, or trade monsters with other Monster Rancher Advance 2 players through use of a second GBA and a link cable.</p>\n<p>Players then raise their monster, deciding what foods to feed them, what drills to teach attributes at, what items to give them, what attacks to add in training, and which characteristics to add or remove at the Hospital. Monsters may become hurt or ill, and can be treated for a fee at the Hospital which also offers free checkups. Players start with a modest sum of money, and earn more by winning in-game tournaments, or by finding valuable items to sell on expeditions. </p>\n<p>The storyline is one of the longest and most complex of any Monster Rancher game. Unlocking various types of monsters involves participating in a variety of events including storyline quests on expeditions, and battling in various tournaments. Players will see characters from older Monster Rancher games, and be introduced to new characters. Monsters now develop bonds with each other and can become friends with monsters within the game, and with monsters in other player's games via link cable use. Completing the storyline requires over 200 hours of gameplay.</p>\n<p>Monsters do not die in this game, but they do face an enforced retirement age. When retired, they can coach other monsters to improve drills, and be used in combining to make stronger baby monsters with more attacks and better characteristics.</p>\n<p>This game has several improvements over the previous Game Boy Advance game including: a counter system added to battles, RPG style expeditions, a monster buddy system, a more complex coaching for pay system, super coaches, the ability to add or remove characteristics, diseases, tag team battles, more hidden monsters, and a new breed of monster.</p>\n<p>In 2 Player mode, monsters can battle against other player's monsters via the GBA link cable. Single monsters can face off against each other, or players can set up tag team battles.</p>",

This game follows the same story as the <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/p,3/gameId,9367/\">PS2/Windows</a> version, but is a platform instead of first person. Your main goal through each level is to avoid all the monsters you will find as well as avoid the many dangerous obstacles.</p>\n<p>The game includes both land and underwater levels for a total of 16 levels in 4 worlds, with over 20 different enemies to face. There are also bonus levels that can be found.</p>\n<p>As your work your way through the levels, Frogger will gain various special abilities such as being able to float or jump to really high areas. These abilities allow Frogger to get through the more difficult levels.</p>",

Every character is challenged over 30 levels, bringing the grand total to over 150 levels in the entire game. Linked play will accommodate two-player co-op via the GBA Link Cable.</p>",

As the bus rolls down the streets, players will release waves of spuds down the street ahead of them, and if a potato runs into a potato of the same color, they will save that potato. There's constant screen action as each spud is animated, and waves its arms to attract your attention. The little spuds are cute, displaying a wide range of comical anims and they're literally everywhere. It's up to players to capture the spuds and save the Earth for good!</p>",

        "description": "<p>Similar to <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/p,12/gameId,5312/\">Gadget Racers</a>, your goal is to complete multiple challenges to open to tracks and challenges in order to win the game.</p>\n<p>Finish in the top 3 in each challenge and win money to upgrade your car. There are over 100 upgrades available such as new engines, tires, steering wheels, shifters... even new car bodies and paint.</p>\n<p>The game consists of 150 challenges on 60 different tracks. These come in the form of standard racing, drag racing, stopping on time within an area, jumping onto \"bullseyes\", running circles around a cone, and more. You'll never be bored from doing the same thing on the same track.</p>\n<p>Enjoy tracks that are paved, sand, and snow. Also, enjoy racing in the rain where traction is poor. With the right upgrades to your car, you can handle these dangers. Without them, you may not finish in the top 3.</p>\n<p>In order to progress in the challenges, you need to finish in the top 3 in each race. If you finish first, you not only get more money, but you also get a prize. Prizes are free parts for your car. This can save you money and can allow you to get certain upgrades more quickly as not all upgrades are available from the start.</p>\n<p>Besides the normal challenges, there are also sprint races and battle races to choose from. Play all these races in single player, or linked with up to 3 other players. Or, connect to the GameCube with Road Trip: Arcade to unlock more content.</p>\n<p>The game tracks all your parts that you have acquired, completed races, race results, and more.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Although the name implies you're going to catch monsters, <em>Monster! Bass Fishing</em> is a normal fishing game where you can catch a variety of fish including various bass, northern pike, catfish, and more. The \"monster\" part is that you get bonus points for catching monster-sized fish.</p>\n<p>The game is played in one of two modes, Challenge or Free Fish. In Free Fish, you can fish in any location that is unlocked for as long as you like. In Challenge, you are competing in a tournament and will have a time limit and a specific location to fish at.</p>\n<p>When you start at a location in either mode, you have the option to move your boat to any place on the map. However, this does take time and may not always be in your best interest in the Challenge mode. You can then either start casting, or you can change your lure first.</p>\n<p>Catching fish is really just a matter of using a good lure and tempting movements. When a fish strikes, you need to keep enough pressure on the line to keep the hook set, or the fish will get away. If you let the line get too tight, the line will break and you'll lose the fish then as well. Now just reel it in and see what you caught.</p>\n<p>The GUI shows a nice fish finder that is color-coded by the type of fish that is seen. Note that this finder is not always accurate.</p>\n<p>Statistics for the game are very nice. You can see a nice picture of your fish that you catch along with the size of it. The top 6 can then be saved in the Aquarium for viewing at any time. Your tournament scores will be based on weight of fish and any monster bonuses (bonuses for catching one of the top 3 largest fish that round). Winning the tournaments will unlock new locations and let you progress to a new location for the next tournament. It will also get you a nice trophy.</p>",

Now is your chance to step up to the mic and win on American Idol!</p>\n<p>Choose to be male or female, then customize your character's looks by changing hair style and color as well as clothing and skin color.  When you are ready with your character, you can choose to practice in Rehearsal, or try out on Endurance, or to try the Competition.</p>\n<p>In Rehearsal, you can practice singing any unlocked songs.  </p>\n<p>Endurance will take you through the entire song list, one after another, as the difficulty level continues to rise.  How far can you go before your performance is too low to continue?</p>\n<p>In the Competition, you are competing against others as you work to win the competition.  Once the list of competitors is narrowed down to the top 10, you will be able to see your opponents and watch replays of their performances.  After each performance, the three judges will comment on your performance.</p>\n<p>To play, you must try to press the given key(s) at the right time.  There are five levels you can get at each place you need to press the key(s).  If you hit it right on, you get the highest ranking and have a chance to get a style bonus if you can do that 5 times in a row.  If you hit it and are off by a little, you will get one of the other rankings, or the lowest ranking if you miss or press the wrong key.  Sometimes you will also have to hold a press for a length of time and let up at the right moment.</p>\n<p>The game offers many songs, but only 2 voices for each song.  If you are male, you get the male voice; if you are female, you get the female voice.  The lyrics will appear as the song is sung, so if you want to learn the song as well as compete, you can.</p>",

Pok\u00e9mon are animal-like creatures with strange powers that inhabit every nook and cranny of the Pok\u00e9mon world. Try to capture them all using Pok\u00e9Balls, create your own personal team of Pok\u00e9mon, and prepare them for for the ultimate battle with the Elite Four!</p>\n<p>It is a remake of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/38673/pocket-monsters-midori/\">Pok\u00e9mon Green</a> (which was sold in other territories with some graphical and gameplay improvements as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4397/pokemon-blue-version/\">Pok\u00e9mon Blue</a> and offers the same diversity of gameplay as the original. However, this game's got everything you might miss in the classic game: updated art, splendid graphics, new Pok\u00e9mon and perhaps the most interesting, the wireless adapter. This allows you to wirelessly trade with your friends within a limited radius. In addition, LeafGreen lets you explore a new set of islands outside of Kanto, the Sevii Islands! Enter the union room, make the team of your dreams or explore the world of Kanto in this epic gameplay experience from the Universe of Pok\u00e9mon.</p>",

The player then goes through the 24 levels of the game mostly jumping, climbing and sometimes fighting.</p>\n<p>The look of the graphics aims toward a comic-book feel instead of the more realistic looking 3D of the console and PC versions.</p>",

Pok\u00e9mon are animal-looking creatures that pretty much form this and all the other games in the Pok\u00e9mon Universe. The challenge is to capture them all using pok\u00e9balls and an own set of these strange creatures, as well as training them for the ultimate battle, the Elite Four!</p>\n<p>The game is a remake of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5129/pokemon-red-version/\">Pok\u00e9mon Red</a> and offers the same diversity of gameplay as the original. However, this game has got everything the player might miss in the classic game: updated art and graphics, new pok\u00e9mon, and perhaps the most interesting: the wireless adapter. This allows the player to trade wireless with friends within a limited radius. In addition to all of this, the player may explore a new set of islands outside of Kanto, the Sevii Islands! Enter the union room, make a dream team or explore the world of Kanto in this epic gameplay experience from the Universe of Pok\u00e9mon.</p>\n<p><em>Gotta catch 'em all!</em></p>",

        "description": "<p>The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age for the Game Boy Advance encompasses the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy, but does so in a unique turn-based strategy formula.</p>\n<p>Unlike the console versions, the Game Boy Advance version gives players the option of playing the heroes from the trilogy, selecting their commander from the likes of Aragorn and Gandalf, or even using the evil forces of Mordor and choosing the Witch-king or Saruman.</p>\n<p>From there, the player experiences over 30 battle scenarios, ranging from the well-known battles of the film (Helm's Deep and the Pelennor Fields), small skirmishes (Amon Hen and Osgiliath), and even some more battles just hinted at in the movies (Isildur's ambush, Theodred's death at the fords of the River Isen).</p>\n<p>In each battle, players choose their companions (again, classic characters from the films such as Legolas and Gimli are available, along with bad guys like Wormtongue and Gorbag), and face off against the foe with dozens of troops, including orcs, trolls, Gondorians, Riders of Rohan, Easterlings, Mumakil, and dozens more.</p>\n<p>Unlike other turn-based games, you can't move all of your units each turn. Rather, the board is divided into three \"flanks,\" and your hero in each flank generates the command points you use to move units in that flank. Thus, good leaders like Aragorn may have a lot of command points to give his flank (3-4 is typical), while Gimli may have less, but be a better warrior to make up for it.</p>\n<p>After a battle, you can upgrade your heroes with equipment and special skills, and move onward to conquer the next area of Middle-earth.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the game based on the movie of the same name, you take control of Mr. Incredible when he is summoned to the island of Nomanisan for a secret assignment. The GBA version is a side-scrolling 2D beat-em-up. Initially, you can only play as Mr. Incredible but the other members of the family, along with Frozone, are playable in the later levels. The main buttons are used for basic attacks, combos and jumps, and the R button triggers special abilities known as \"incredi-moves\". Each member has a different special move: Mr. Incredible gets super strength, Dash runs faster, Violet has a force field and becomes invisible, and Helen can extend her arms. Using these depletes an additional meter on the screen. It is recharged by collecting icons and defeating enemies.</p>\n<p>Next to the icons used for incredi-moves, you can also collect band-aid to restore your health, extra lives, and frozone bottles. There are more than 30 levels, with a few chase sequences (playing as Dash), and familiar characters such as Syndrome, E and Bomb Voyage make an appearance. Both the enemies, carrying a variety of weapons, and the levels have a distinct hand-drawn, comic-book look, rather than mimicking the 3D visuals from the film. After completing a level, you receive a password to continue the next time.</p>",

A handful of boss races round out the action, and provide a challenge for players.</p>\n<p>The twist to this game comes as the racers collect energy on the track to digivolve into upgraded versions of themselves. Once you've digivolved, you can use additional offensive powers to further hamper your opponents and keep your own Digimon ahead of the others.</p>\n<p>While the single-player game will keep you busy for a while with its many modes and characters, Digimon Racing really shines in the multiplayer arena.

With the Kingdom turned upside down, the Prince must right this wrong and save all, using the Sands of Time itself to his advantage.</p>\n<p>Unlike the console versions, this GBA title reverts back to the tried and true platform adventuring of the original Prince of Persia, with added elements of action and puzzle solving. Players can use the power of the Dagger of Time to reverse time if a mistake is made during play, and you will also control a second character during play to open switches for the Prince to proceed.</p>",

For many years, the war between angels and demons has been going on. You control an ordinary boy named Cain. You live on a secluded island as a servant of a woman named Matia, far away and seemingly safe from the battle areas. But as both demons and angels seem to be interested in Matia and she gets kidnapped eventually, Cain realizes he must do everything to save her, and becomes involved in the great struggle.</p>\n<p>This is a strategy RPG with turn-based combat, in which you navigate your party members on the isometric battle screen and attack or use magic spells when the enemy is in range. Story sequences occur between battles which take up most of the gameplay.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Disney\u2019s Lilo &amp; Stitch 2: H\u00e4msterviel Havoc</em> is a platform shooter and strategy game with some kart-racing levels that is based on <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series</em>, a TV show that follows the 2002 Disney film <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em>. <em>H\u00e4msterviel Havoc</em> is a sequel to the original film's 2002 <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/27376/disneys-lilo-stitch/\">Game Boy Advance tie-in game</a>. The game allows the player to play as Hawaiian girl Lilo Pelekai and alien experiment Stitch as well as other characters from the show. The plot revolves around the title characters rescuing Jumba Jookiba's experiments (also known as Stitch's \"cousins\") from Dr. Jacques von H\u00e4msterviel, and eventually defeat H\u00e4msterviel himself.</p>\n<p>You play action parts of the game as Stitch. These parts resemble a <em>Metal Slug</em>-style shooter, with double jumps and 8-directional shooting. The strategy/puzzle parts of the game are played by Lilo. These involve using other experiments to help you make your way through the level. The experiments are other characters from the show that have special abilities such as moving through electrical wires. The experiments can also be utilized by Stitch in later levels to fight enemies.</p>",

The hero is a young member of the Unicorn Brigade of the Highland Army. One night, your camp is attacked. You and your best friend Jowy escape, and the fate takes you into different directions, when you get involved in a war between several nations.</p>\n<p>Unlike the main <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/465/suikoden-series/\">Suikoden</a> games, <em>Gens\u014d Suikoden Card Stories</em> is a card-based RPG. Most of the game is spent playing a special card game with your opponents. The complex card game is not unlike a strategy battle: you have three types of cards, some of which take you to a specific \"mission\" (you open the game with such cards), while others represent various characters with different strengths and weaknesses. You can acquire cards in shops, get them from your opponents, and also look for them in randomly generated dungeons.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Long time ago, a powerful demon was captured and sealed within a contraption that was called \"Messiah Riser\". At present time, an evil empire is trying to find a key that would unlock Messiah Riser and unleash the power of the fiend. Two children Jin and Akira, the heroes of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=DemiKids\"> DemiKids</a>, called \"The Devil Children\" thanks to their unique ability to communicate with demons, decide to confront the empire and to stop their evil plan.</p>\n<p>\"Messiah Riser\" is a part of Devil Children games, which are a branch of <em>Megaten</em> game franchise, directed towards younger players. Like in all Megaten games, the trademark of \"Messiah Riser\" is the ability to communicate with demons you fight and to make them help you in battles. You can play the game as either Jin or Akira (the choice will influence the storyline). The battles are now a mixture between turn-based and real time style: enemies will perform a move even if you wait and do nothing, so quick thinking is necessary for combat. After an enemy is defeated, you can talk to it and try to persuade it to join your party. Demons will then fight for you, controlled as playable characters. Like in \"mature\" Megami Tensei games, you can fuse two demons to create a more powerful one.</p>",

You play as either Tenran or Aoi, a teenage boy and girl, respectively, on quest to defeat the ancient evil that threatens the prosperous land of Jipang, to prove themselves worthy of the legendary Fire Clan, warriors who have been protecting Jipang for many generations from evil demons and warlocks. The land Jipang is very similar to medieval Japan, and during your adventure you'll also visit Mongolia, China, and other Asian countries. </p>\n<p>The most important new feature of the game is a non-linear storyline. You can tackle many missions in any order you want, and the storyline also changes depending on the outcome of major battles. If you lose against a boss enemy, the game is not over, but instead, a branching storyline path is revealed. Otherwise, the gameplay is similar to other Tengai Makyou games, featuring overworld map traveling and first person perspective, turn-based combat.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Yusuke Urameshi was hardly a role model among Japanese schoolboys: somewhat of a ruffian, eager to get into fights, perhaps even deserving the title \"punk\". However, one day Yusuke tried to save a little boy, and was killed in the process. Unlike most of us, he has been given a second chance: he can continue living if he agrees to become a \"Spirit Detective\", a supernatural fighter who hunts down demons that plague our world. So the young man is back to his school life, with only a few people aware of his new secret identity...</p>\n<p>Based on the initial chapters of the <em>Yu Yu Hakusho</em> manga, <em>Yu Yu Hakusho: Spirit Detective</em> is an isometric action role-playing game. The player can switch between various characters from the manga and anime, including Yusuke himself, his rival Kuwabara, his love interest Kayko, and others. Most of the game consists of accepting and completing missions, which usually involve tracking down and eliminating specific demons. The characters can fight with bare hands or use special \"spirit attacks\". Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies. Once a character levels up, he/she can learn more moves (punching, kicking, etc.) and new spirit attacks, up to three per character.</p>",

The search for Pooky will take Garfield through his most known locales, he will meet the other characters (like Jon, Odie, Arlene, etc.), and of course encounter typical Garfield elements like spiders, food, mice, dogs, etc.</p>\n<p>During his search Garfield will inevitably eat food and lots of it of course. In the game food will also represent energy. The more food Garfield eats, the more energy he has to do extraordinary moves. A level plays like a sideway scrolling platform game, though some levels will also scroll up and down to span a larger vertical area. Garfield moves from one side of the screen towards the other and must pick up food and other goodies on the way. At the same time all sorts of obstacles will have to be avoided, such as web spinning spiders, happy Odie rushing towards Garfield, bad food, annoying kids, angry pit-bulls, and more.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Astro Boy: Omega Factor is a side-scrolling action game based off a 2003 remake of Osamu Tezuka's classic Astro Boy anime and manga series from the 1960s. You play as the young, boylike robot Astro Boy, a true mechanical pacifist who's biggest dream is that one day humans and robots can coexist in peace. Armed with a strong punch, rocket powered feet and the ability to shoot laserbeams from your fingers, arms and behind, you set off on a quest against all sorts of evildoers from the Astro Boy series.</p>\n<p>The game has two distinctive types of levels: the more prevalent beat-em-up levels and the shooter-esque levels. During the beat-em-up levels you can walk around freely and your flying ability is limited to short bursts. The shooter levels differ from each other: sometimes you can float around the screen and shoot in both directions, other times you are flying in a set direction in a more on-the-rails fashion.</p>\n<p>The Omega Factor mentioned in the title is actually a simple upgrading system for your weapons. Every time Astro meets someone new (be they good or bad) he or she will be added to the Omega factor screen and Astro can upgrade one of his six weapons or abilities.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Wario's thrown a temper tantrum while playing his Game Boy Advance, and gone and broken it! He heads off to the manic Dr. Crygor's lab to get him to fix it. But what happens instead is that hundreds of Game Boy-like systems are created, with no buttons and an addictive tilt control! Wario's gonna be even richer than ever before when he sells this!</p>\n<p><em>WarioWare Twisted!</em> is the sequel to the sleeper hit <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=045496732370\">WarioWare Inc.: Mega: Microgame$!</a>. It includes a built-in rumble pack and gyro sensor which the games have been designed around. Over two hundred five second games are hurled at the player as they make their way through the stage, trying to figure out what to do with a short description like \"Play!\", \"Avoid!\" or \"Digest!\". Each stage has a random game thrown at you, with a short time to complete it. Fail it, and you lose one of your four lives. Lose all four and it's game over. Pass enough games, and you'll get told \"FASTER!\" and the games start coming at you at a quicker speed. Finally, you'll encounter a Boss Stage, which has no time limit and is tougher to beat.</p>\n<p>Each character's stage is based around a different 'theme'. Mona's games require you to make only a small spin to pass them, Jimmy T.'s games need a consistent rhythm to play, Kat and Ana's games simply need the use of the A Button, Dr. Crygor's games involve changing gravity itself, while the Nintendo nerd pair 9-Volt and 18-Volt have a set of Nintendo games which use all of the different styles of play from the other game sets.</p>\n<p><em>Twisted!</em> also has a huge amount of novelty unlockables to collect. Once you've played through Story Mode, you can replay the games again for a higher score and bonus toys. Whenever you beat a Boss Game after completing Story Mode once, you'll be prompted to spin to get a bonus prize. This prize could be as simple as a light wand that you shake to see a picture, or a small arcade-style game involving sewing or rolling a cat around the floor while shooting bugs.</p>",

The game is divided into six chapters, each containing numerous stages. The player will have to tilt the world (using the tilt sensor) to help Yoshi climb walls, open new paths, and send enemies rolling away. Happiness Medals should be earned, allowing the player to move on to the next chapter if Yoshi successfully clears certain objectives that the Spirits ask of him. Along the way, Yoshi will be transformed into a ship, a ball, and a balloon.</p>",

First, you've got to have the right look to get into the club: select from the twins' wardrobe of clothes, shoes, and accessories. Then it's time to dance the night away. Like other popular music games, Girls Night Out will challenge you to repeat a series of key-press patterns to the game's music. Dance well and you'll unlock new dance moves, new songs, and even clothes. You can also rock the house by playing DJ for the club. The game lets you create and save your own music mixes from techno, house, and disco clips.</p>",

The player takes control of all three children as they go through training and are then forced to travel around the world to save members of International Rescue from an evil villain known as The Hood.</p>\n<p>The game takes place in locales such as the International Rescue island, Africa, and even outer space. Each of the three characters has his or her own unique abilities that the player must use to solve puzzles and advance through a level. Alan has strength and jumping ability, Tin-Tin has telekinetic powers that are used to move objects, and Fermat can hack computers and roll through holes. While the majority of the gameplay is primarily composed of solving puzzles from an overhead view, there are also flight action sequences where the player can fly one of the many vehicles known as the Thunderbirds.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Rebelstar: Tactical Command</em> is a turn-based strategy game in the same vein as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=X-Com\">X-Com</a>, and is based off the Rebelstar strategy game setting. The developer, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Codo+Technologies\">Codo Technologies</a>, is composed of staff who have worked on games such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Laser+Squad+Nemesis\">Laser Squad Nemesis</a>, X-Com, and the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/180/laser-squad/\">Laser Squad</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/55196/rebelstar-raiders/\">Rebelstar Raiders</a>. R:TC offers a similar style of play, and it may appeal to fans those titles and turn-based strategy games.</p>\n<p>In <em>Rebelstar: TC</em>, players take control of a squad of 6 soldiers in a series of battles against an alien oppressor. The main character is Jorel, a young recruit to the rebel cause against the antagonist Arelian species. As the game and story progresses, Jorel will rise up the ranks to lead and recruit additional characters, each with a particular specialization of skills. In addition to fighting the Arelians, players will also do battle with the brutish shock troops of the Zorn, the insect-like Fraylar, and a variety of lesser creatures and robots. </p>\n<p>Gameplay revolves around the player completing a series of battles in order to progress the plot. Prior to the start of most missions, players must select the characters that will participate in the battle and equip them appropriately. <em>Rebelstar: TC</em> offers a wide range of weapons, including melee, assault rifles, SMGs, sniper rifles, and heavy weapons. Firearms may also offer different firing modes, such as single shot, limited burst fire, and full automatic. Other equipment include different types of body armor, grenades, power cells, and medical kits. Characters have a number of statistics that govern their movement, speed, weapon use, stealth, and other skills. As the game proceeds and characters perform various actions, they gain experience points and level up. Each level up provides an opportunity for the player to add skill points to a chosen skill. The greater the skill rating, the better the character can perform or utilize weapons and equipment.</p>\n<p>The battles themselves are turn-based in nature, with the player moving and performing actions with his characters, then the enemy side doing the same once the player is done. Each character has a pool of \"Action Points\" to spend on actions during a turn. A character can thus perform a series of actions until he or she runs out of points. These action points refill at the beginning of the player's next turn. Players can also spend all of the character's points to place him on \"Overwatch.\" On this mode, a character will spend his stored action points on firing on any enemy that comes into his view, which is useful if you wish to have a character cover certain areas. Battles also take into account line of sight, terrain deformation (ie: walls blown up by explosives), and morale. All of these features give quite a number of tactical options and considerations to the game.</p>",

A creature calling itself the Dream Juju grabs the staff and disappears. With the help of your mentor Jibolba and his brother JB, you find out it was a vision about the theft of the Staff of Dreams, an item can open a portal for nightmare creatures.</p>\n<p>You guide Tak in this side-scrolling 2D platformer as he sets off to retrieve the magical scepter. He can jump, use items and has an inventory, but you can also collect magical powers to build up the Juju meter. With a maxed out meter, you get access to special abilities such as double jumps, rolls, floating and ground stomps. These powers are also used to solve puzzles. Each region has a Yorbel Store where you can buy power-ups with yorbels, collected during the levels or earned by playing a mini-game.</p>\n<p>By filling up magical bottles with energy, you get access to the parallel Dream World where hidden platforms in the regular levels are revealed. There are nine worlds to explore and you can save one game on the cartridge.</p>",

With the championship invitations in hand, the fighters (some of them) decided to participate not just to compare their strength, but also to investigate rumors that Gustav is involved with serial kidnappings involving children and also his involvement with a secret operation related to the Orochi Power.</p>\n<p>Being the second installment of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/478/king-of-fighters-series/\">KOF Series</a> on Nintendo's 32-bit handheld, this title brings a lot of gameplay characteristics and elements taken from its arcade/console counter-part <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7380/the-king-of-fighters-2000/\">The King of Fighters 2000</a> like the backgrounds and a good part of its musical repertoire.</p>\n<p>However, a set of additional stuff was included, like the appearance of 3 all-new exclusive characters (the male Reiji Okami and the females Miu Kurosaki and Jun Kagami), 2 new backgrounds, a modified Striker System (where the 2nd and 3rd players of a team will assume progressively this function) and a \"Ranking Mode\", where you'll be rated according to your fighting performance (beginning from Newcomer until Master Orochi).</p>\n<p>With the return of 3 on 3 matches and the introduction of new fighters, the main cast is formed by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Hero Team:</em> Kyo Kusanagi, Moe Habana and Reiji Okami</li>\n<li><em>Fatal Fury Team:</em> Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard and Mai Shiranui</li>\n<li><em>Ikari Team:</em> Leona Heidern, Ralf Jones and Clark Steel</li>\n<li><em>Korea Team:</em> Kim Kaphwan, Choi Bounge and Chang Koehan</li>\n<li><em>Psycho Soldier Team:</em> Athena Asamiya, Sie Kensou and Bao</li>\n<li><em>Art of Fighting Team:</em> The Sakazaki family (Ryo, Yuri and Takuma)</li>\n<li><em>Yagami Team:</em> Iori Yagami, Jun Kagami and Miu Kurosaki</li>\n</ul>",

Daddy Bigbucks (the villain from the game's predecessor, <i>The Urbz</i>) is secretly filming a reality TV show in Strangetown, and pushes your own Sim to mix things up for the cameras.</p>\n<p>You'll make friends and enemies, have romances, play minigames (some of which are thinly disguised as fictional commercial breaks), and participate in 11 standalone episodes, each with their own plots and situations. In one episode, you might be dealing with Don Fusilli and his mob, in another episode you might be battling lady bugs after being shrunk down to the size of a bug by a homebrewed cola.</p>\n<p>Overall, the game is less of a simulation and more of a quirky adventure game through a colorful desert town.</p>",

Though the game looks like a traditional side-scroller, combat takes a backseat to clever puzzle-solving and adventure game elements. The three orphans must use their talents, along with items found in the world, and various interactions to escape each level and avoid the evil Count Olaf and his elaborate plans to inherit the children's fortune.</p>\n<p>Inventions also take a big role in this game, and players will have to assemble them from common household objects. For example, in one level, Violet will be hunting for ice cream scoopers, soup cans, and a crank to invent an \"apple chucker\" which can help defeat Count Olaf's friends.</p>\n<p>The game offers quite a bit of replayability, too, with quest points and exotic books earned for discovering all the game's quirky secrets.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Two years have now passed since the last edition of \"King of Fighters\" Tournament, accomplished in 1997: after Orochi was sealed by the joint forces of Kyo Kusanagi, Chizuru Kagura and Iori Yagami, all the fighters returned to their normal lives. But suddenly, a mysterious host decided to reopen the tournament and have been sent serial invitations to the most powerful fighters. But there are many secrets surrounding this happy-hour fighting clash, as the apparent disappearance of Iori Yagami and a remote distrust behind this unknown sponsor: that he would be using the championship to accomplish secret operations involving (maybe) the Orochi power...</p>\n<p>This title marks the first installment of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/478/king-of-fighters-series/\">King of Fighters Series</a> on Nintendo's 32-bit handheld. It brings a lot of gameplay characteristics based in both <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3992/the-king-of-fighters-evolution/\">KOF Evolution</a> (most of the graphic stuff and principally both \"Striker\" System and backgrounds, now represented by a static 2D frame instead of the original 3D ones) and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7380/the-king-of-fighters-2000/\">KOF 2000</a> (the musical repertoire).</p>\n<p>Besides the traditional game modes (Team Play, Team Battle, Single Play, Single Battle, Endless Survival and Survival Time Attack), this game marks too the debut of a new-exclusive female character named Moe Habana.</p>\n<p>With the permanence of 3 on 3 combats (plus Striker Attacks) and the introduction of a new female fighter, the main cast is composed by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Hero Team:</em> Kyo Kusanagi, Benimaru Nikaido, Moe Habana and Shingo Yabuki</li>\n<li><em>Fatal Fury Team:</em> Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard, Mai Shiranui and Joe Higashi</li>\n<li><em>Art of Fighting Team:</em> Ryo Sakazaki, Robert Garcia, King and Yuri Sakazaki</li>\n<li><em>Ikari Team:</em> Leona Heidern, Ralf Jones, Clark Steel and Whip</li>\n<li><em>Psycho Soldier Team:</em> Athena Asamiya, Sie Kensou, Bao and Chin Gentsai</li>\n<li><em>Korea Team:</em> Kim Kaphwan, Chang Koehan, Choi Bounge and Jhun Hoon</li>\n</ul>",

One of the key aspects is the \"State of Grace\"; by making fancy moves (such as overhead kicks, heel passes or heading the ball back and forth) and scoring goals, a power bar starts filling, and when it's full, all team attributes are maxed up and the players are given the ability to quickly run with the ball.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Guru Logi Champ</em> is a Japanese-only puzzle game. In it, you control a cannon manned by two ducks. Each level shows a grid with missing blocks that you must fill in using your cannon. You can only fire and suck in certain bricks from this grid, and any blocks you shoot must land on another block so that they stop moving. It's up to you to use a combination of shooting and sucking, as well as rotating the screen using the L and R Buttons, to fill in any missing blocks from the grid. When this is complete, the level will end, and you will be shown that the missing blocks created a picture.</p>\n<p>The game has a series of levels, each with their own set of puzzles. There is a main goal for each level. In one, ducks in spiky eggshells have stolen a tap handle, and a thirsty athlete needs a drink of water. You need to solve a set amount of puzzles before you can break the last puzzle in the stage open, solve it, and reclaim the item needed to help the person or people for that stage.</p>\n<p>Multiplayer mode features the same basic mechanics as single player, except that the puzzles are extremely simplified (usually not requiring more than four blocks to fill). Each player has their own puzzle grid to manipulate, and the first player to fill in all of their blocks wins the round. This makes for some very hectic and close matches against other players. Whoever wins the most out of the preset amount of rounds wins the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Nonono Puzzle Chairian is a set of three puzzle games in one cartridge, and is developed by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Creatures+Inc\">Creatures</a> of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pokemon\">Pok\u00e9mon</a> fame. A group of aliens travelling in space get sucked into a black hole, which makes all of their machines go haywire. Each puzzle game is based around one of their machines, but has the same basic mechanic - you control a cursor which can rotate a 2x2 square block either clockwise or anti-clockwise.</p>\n<p>The first (and most well-known) game has you fixing a microwave. You must shift the food into the holes using the cursor before time runs out, and if you do so, the food is served. Every five rounds, you get a difficult challenge where there is only a set path to move around.</p>\n<p>The second game has you guiding a little white blob with legs. You cannot directly control him, but you can use your cursor to rotate paths in front of him to safely get him to the finish line. You can also make him run by holding the R Button.</p>\n<p>The final, and most in-depth game, shows an 8x8 grid of coloured number blocks, from three to six. Line up three 'threes', and they turn into fours, line up four 'fours', and they turn into fives, line up five 'fives', and they turn into sixes, and line up six 'sixes', and they disappear. You can line the blocks up either horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally. You can also move other blocks around while numbers are changing to set off massive combos.</p>",

Take care of the spoiled Penelope with the help of your friends while you're on earth, then blast off into space and combat the villainous genius, Maximus I.Q. (Evil Master Mind).</p>\n<p>Atomic Betty is a mix of the platform and puzzle genres, and plays very similarly to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1547/the-lost-vikings/\">The Lost Vikings</a>, in that you control three different characters simultaneously, each with varying abilities. However, because Atomic Betty is aimed at a younger audience, there are two notable differences: first, it is a lot more difficult to die, and second, the player only needs to get one character to the exit to successfully finish the level.</p>\n<p>When on Earth, the player controls one character that can finish the homework, one that can push or pull objects, and the last that can slide under narrow gaps. In Space, one character can repeatedly attack and use special gadgets, one can use a jetpack for a very high jump, and the last can grab items and enemies. In addition to the main levels, the game also features levels where the player must control the spaceship as it zooms through asteroid belts and high-speed space warps.</p>",

Together the pair work as a team to take on Monkey Fist, Senior Senior Sr. and Jr., and of course, the ever-incompetent Dr. Drakken, as they try to work out who stole Kim's grandmother's photo album.</p>\n<p>Players must use both Kim and Ron effectively as they make their way through the many large levels of Team Possible.  Each character has their own strengths and weaknesses: Ron does not have much attack power, but he makes up for this later by getting better gadgets than Kim.  Kim, on the other hand, can defeat enemies without much difficulty, but cannot access particular areas without Ron's help.</p>\n<p>The game is also unique in that two players can link up and play the game co-operatively, with one playing as Kim, and the other as Ron.  This also makes certain sections, such as the rocket skate racing levels, more competitive.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This GBA version of Ace Lightning is based on the BBC TV show of the same name which is a mixture of CGI and live action. It first plays from an overhead view of an Amusement Park where you can enter open doors which lead to 12 different themed worlds. Each world is a 2D side-scrolling platformer, where you face different enemies and end-level bosses all in your quest to find the Gold Amulet.  Once you finish a certain number of the levels,  you'll be rewarded with one of two mini-games. One is a target range where you have to shoot a number of enemies within a certain time. The other is a strength test where Ace must swing to hit a bell at the top of a pole.</p>",

While each of Wario Ware's stages has a theme, each of Homecoming Havoc's minigames in the ten stages are randomly selected from the game's minigame library.</p>\n<p>As players progress through the minigames, they earn points and tokens. Tokens can be used to purchase cards that will allow you to skip a particular type of minigame if you fail it. At the end of each set of ten minigames, there is a Dance Competition. In this game, players must input the correct arrow sequence using the Control Pad as the arrows pass along the screen.</p>",

These range from mundane class assignments like collecting ingredients for a potion to facing off against a giant troll. To master these challenges, Harry can learn five spells that allow him to push back opponents, flip switches, open doors, levitate objects and more. If Harry is hurt, he can find and eat Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans to regain health. By performing admirably in learning spells and completing missions, Harry can gain extra House Points so that Gryffindor might win the House Cup. If he misbehaves by attacking other students, or being caught wandering the halls at night, points will be deducted, however.\nAs seeker for the Gryffindor team, Harry must also compete in Quidditch matches. The game has a special mode for Quidditch and other events where Harry might have to mount his broom.</p>",

American players may recognize this game as <a href=\"/game/tetris-attack\">Tetris Attack</a> or <a href=\"/game/pokmon-puzzle-league\">Pok\u00e9mon Puzzle League</a>. A pile of colored tiles moves upwards on the screen as the player attempts to rearrange them to eliminate groups of three or more like types. The in-game characters who appear throughout the game to challenge or encourage the player are generic cute characters; none of Nintendo's famous mascots make an appearance.

He finds theater actress Ann Darrow and wants her to play the part of one of his characters.  Carl gets writer Jack Driscoll to finish Carl's script while they are traveling on a ship to an island that Carl believes to be real, but no one else does.  He plans to shoot his movie there.  Once they arrive at the island known as Skull Island, Ann is captured and now Carl, Jack, &amp; the cast of Carl's movie goes out to find her.</p>\n<p>This is a top-view game with cartoon-like visuals and some Legend Of Zelda type gameplay.  You start out with Jack, Carl, &amp; Ann and at that point, you learn how to play the game in a short tutorial.  Jack has a machete and a tommy gun so that makes him the attacker against the creatures that lurk on Skull Island.  Carl has grenades.  You could attack enemies with it, but your suppose to use them for getting rocks out of the way that block the entrance of caves.  Ann (in the beginning) can heal Jack &amp; Carl.  After Ann is captured, you have to play as Jack &amp; Carl.</p>\n<p>You can also play as King Kong a few times in the game.  They are short levels that consist of you playing as Kong in levels that are timed and that are like beat-em-up games we've seen in the past, and you slowly beat up the creatures that come after you.  You also get an energy boost when you defeat most of the enemies.</p>",

You must progress through the game as either of the two main characters, gunning down the bad guys along your intended path while also using the latest spy gear to your advantage in gaining access to certain areas and avoiding hazards. 24 missions await you, based in locations around the world.</p>\n<p>The story takes place after the events of the first title, where Ecks originally tried to hunt down Sever. Here, they work together to discover the secrets behind a worldwide weapon cartel, and only they can shut it down before things get out of hand.</p>\n<p>Two player co-operative campaigns add to the package, where you'll play as both characters through a number of missions. Up to four can compete in Deathmatch, capture the flag and many other multiplayer modes.</p>",

The levels have been adapted from the console version for the two dimensional isometric perspective; one is even taken from the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3567/tony-hawks-pro-skater/\">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a>.</p>\n<p>In Career Mode, choose from one of 13 professional skaters and, in each level, complete various goals like collecting items, performing special tricks and of course breaking high scores by performing tricks and combos. Completing the goals earns money which unlocks new levels and can be spent on new boards, tricks and upgrading your skater's stats. In competition levels, you don't skate for money but compete for a medal.</p>\n<p>In the Free Skate and Single Session modes, unlocked levels can be practiced and new high scores be established.</p>",

At the end of each planet you will have to defeat the corresponding boss, and the story finishes with a battle with an evil enemy well known to all Dragon Ball fans...</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Darius R</em> is a Japan-only remake of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/22038/darius/\">Darius</a> for the GBA. It places you in the cockpit of the Silverhawk once again in order to defeat the forces of intergalactic fish threatening the galaxy in standard side-scrolling space shooter fare. </p>\n<p>Standout features include the use of the classic Darius level selection scheme that allows the game to branch in different stages and thus offer a series of different endings depending on what road you take. Unique for this GBA remake is the ability to play each stage individually (once you unlock it in the main campaign) in a level-select mode.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Halloween Town is preparing for this year's Halloween, and Jack Skellington is sure that this one will be the best ever! However, Oogie Boogie has other plans - furious that he has no holiday of his own, he commands Lock, Shock and Barrel to kidnap Jack so that he can take his place as the King of Halloween and claim the holiday for himself. Unfortunately, the trio kidnap Sally by mistake. Angered by their bumbling, Oogie Boogie releases thousands of bugs into Halloween Town, sending the citizens into hiding. It's up to Jack to save Halloween Town...and his holiday!</p>\n<p>Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King is an action-adventure game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4304/castlevania-circle-of-the-moon/\">Castlevania: Circle of the Moon</a>. The game is set before the movie <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em>, before Jack's encounter with Santa Claus and Oogie Boogie. The game takes place in one gigantic overworld which Jack can explore. As he earns new weapons, such as the Frog Gun and Bat Boomerang, he can unlock new areas and access more of the overworld. Early in the game, he'll also find his ghost dog, Zero, who can help by finding secret areas and navigating through small spaces.</p>\n<p>The game also features three mini-games that can be played either against the computer, or versus up to three friends. There's 'Bone Breaker', where you must be the first to smash the skeleton, 'Whack Hammer', where you must smash as many rats and bats as possible, and 'Skulldigger', you must find the correct box with the Shrunken Head.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Premier Action Soccer is a budget priced title based on the FIFA World Cup 2006 held in Germany, released on its opening day. Including all 32 teams participating in the tournament rated in four areas (defense, midfield, attack and overall) with fictional player names (although fans will quickly recognize who T. Brinks and M. Pallack from Germany, Manillas from Spain and Romualdo of Brazil are), players can take part in friendlies, play the World Cup (the real 2006 groups are included, but it's possible to randomize them) or train for penalty shootouts. </p>\n<p>Gameplay is simple and straightforward. A and B buttons control kicking the ball (low and high, respectively), being possible to shoot at goal using either one, all depending on distance to goal. After kicking the ball, the player can add aftertouch to the ball tapping the d-pad, making it go away from the goalkeeper of from a defender. The R button allows the player to accelerate, as long as he has enough stamina, shown by white circles under his name. Several tactical options such as formation, strategy and individual orders are included.</p>",

The first is an action sidescroller, where players take control of the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow as he tries to reclaim his soul back from Davy Jones. He'll run, jump, and battle cannibals, pirates, the royal navy, and Davy Jones' monstrous crew across 15 islands, each made up of several maps.</p>\n<p>Between the islands, players gets to captain Sparrow's ship, the Black Pearl. They'll need to equip her with food (otherwise the crew might mutiny!), cannons, and supplies enough to fend off privateers and pirates on the open sea.</p>\n<p>Radically different than versions of the same title on other platforms, the Game Boy Advance version gives players a lot of gameplay variety over the course of the game. The open-ended island exploration, ship-to-ship battles, and \"RPG-lite\" upgrade system means that players can play this game in many different ways.</p>",

The GBA version was licensed separately, and only the characters remind of the Crazy Frog world. The typical music and soundbites are not present.</p>\n<p>Only singleplayer is available, and no story at all. The main game modes are Grand Prix, two modes based on checkpoints (alone or against opponents), and Last Man Standing where the last one drops after each lap. Grand Prix consists of three classes based on different speed, with three cups each, and and extra cup. Controls allow for speeding up, braking, using items to hinder your opponents (mines, nails, boxing gloves...), and there is a button to drift through the corners. Record times can be saved on the Battery Backed RAM.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Trouble is brewing in Gotham City: The Joker has another nefarious plan for bringing down Batman. It begins with a break-in at the Gotham Museum and ends with the Joker falling from the Gotham Bridge, apparently to his death (as depicted in the first levels of gameplay). \nNow, Gotham's other supervillains, including Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy don't rest and want to fill the void left by the Joker. Thankfully, Batman is not alone in his efforts to stop them, as his trusted companions Robin and Batgirl are there to help.</p>\n<p>Batman: Vengeance for the GBA has the same basic story as its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5190/batman-vengeance/\">counterpart on consoles</a> (and uses stills from that version's rendered sequences for story cutscenes), but differs in gameplay. Both games are inspired by the 1990s Batman animated TV series rather than the comics.</p>\n<p>The game has four different kinds of levels:</p>\n<p>In the side-scrolling levels, Batman runs and jumps from left to right, beating up various henchmen with kicks and punches. He can also use various gadgets: batarangs and smoke bombs to take out enemies and a grappling hook to reach otherwise inaccessible areas.</p>\n<p>In the Batmobile stages, viewed from the top, the Batmobile has to reach a goal within a certain time limit. Naturally, the road is filled with both traffic and other obstacles that take time from the clock or slow Batman down. Thankfully, the Batmobile is equipped with a gun that can take some obstacles out of the way.</p>\n<p>It's Robin and Batgirl's turn in the Batplane stages, which are similar to traditional side-scrolling shoot'em'ups. The Batplane has to be steered through an automatically scrolling landscape, filled with flying hazards and various guns. The plane can be made invulnerable for a short time by employing an energy shield, and it is also equipped with a gun to fight back.</p>\n<p>Finally, Robin goes at it solo in the so-called Puzzle stages. Viewed from the top, Robin must navigate a labyrinth of rooms and find the exit. Crates block the way that have to be moved in the correct order to free the path. Passwords and key cards must be found to open barriers. To gain access to areas behind holes that are too small to pass through, a remote-controlled robot called the Batcrawler can be used. These stages also have enemies to be defeated.</p>\n<p>Once the game has been finished in Story Mode, a password is given out for Advance Mode. Advance Mode features slightly different versions of the original levels with different goals: in the side-scrolling, Puzzle and Batmobile levels, three data disks must be collected and the end of the level reached before a timer runs out. In the Batplane levels, the Joker has placed three \"Pyro toys\", which have to be destroyed, again before a timer runs out.</p>",

Both Exhibition and Ironman Road feature match kinds such as Gruesome and Deathmatch (inside a electrified cage) with all assorted rule changes included. There's also the ability to play in a four-man Battle Royal.</p>\n<p>The CAW mode, one of the selling points of the original SNES titles, is as good as ever, allowing to create Wrestlers from scratch, personalizing them from how they look to how they fight, as well as trading them between federations.</p>",

Gameplay has been tweaked to allow playing with only four buttons, making some actions such as lobbing only accessible through double taps on the passing button, yet it retains the attention to ball movement and focus on accurate passing of the \"big\" versions. Graphically, player sprites are like their polygonal models, with a lot of similar movements.</p>\n<p>Game modes include Friendly, League mode, Cup (European Championships, Copa America, CAN, Asian Cup and custom), World Tournament and Master League.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The game for Game Boy Advance based on the second Harry Potter book and movie is, like its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/21208/harry-potter-and-the-sorcerers-stone/\">predecessor</a>, an action adventure, this time with an isometric perspective.</p>\n<p>In Harry's second year at Hogwarts, bad things are happening. The ancient Chamber of Secrets has been opened, and what lurks within is attacking students. To get through this ordeal alive (and advance the plot) Harry must again complete various challenges.\n These mostly consist of navigating large mazes - fighting monsters, solving puzzles, flipping switches and pressing buttons for doors to open. Six spells are available to help. As Harry is often in places he shouldn't be, stealth sequences are also a large part of the game. To avoid teachers and prefects, he can sneak around slowly and hide behind curtains. If he is caught, he is thrown out (to try again) and house points can be deducted.</p>\n<p>As in other Potter games, there are a lot of collectibles, found both in plain view and in hidden areas. Sets of Famous Wizard cards unlock bonuses, Every Flavour Beans get Harry passwords that let him move through shortcuts in the school and Chocolate Frogs increase his maximum stamina.</p>\n<p>Finally, Quidditch is also back in this game, this time in three-dimensional space, viewed from the back.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This handheld racing game offers a range of 12 licensed cars (including models by Chevrolet, Dodge, GM, Lotus and Mitsubishi), several circuits, and a set of opponents. To these stock elements, it adds one more: weaponry. Now you can choose to nitro past the opponent ahead of you, or slow him down with a missile.</p>\n<p>With each vehicle and driver pair you can race in Practice Mode to familiarize yourself with tracks or choose  Championship Mode to progress through a series of circuits. After each race you'll need to spend some of the money you've earned (either by achieving a good placement or picking up money icons during the race) to repair and, if possible, upgrade your car. Upgrades can improve your car as a racing machine (e.g. a larger engine or better brakes) or as a war machine (e.g. adding more weapons bays or buying a new type of weapon).</p>\n<p>The track design uses isometric view, and almost never puts the car behind an obstacle. However, among the twisty roads are a few shortcuts that require you to think outside the lines of the road, and occasionally take a leap of faith.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Rhythm Tengoku</em> is a music game based around good timing and rhythm. The game has music supplied by the record production company J.P. ROOM, and is developed by the team responsible for <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=045496732370\">Wario Ware</a>. This is visible in the quirky presentation of the game.</p>\n<p>As with Wario Ware, the game is actually a series of shorter games bundled into one package. Before each game starts, you are presented with a short tutorial that gets you ready and practice before you begin the real thing. Control is normally very simple - usually, only the A Button is required, but some games make players press multiple buttons for different actions.</p>\n<p>Players will punch in time with a karate expert as pots and rocks are thrown; pluck hairs off of an onion; march in time to an instructor; hit a baseball while the screen zooms in and out; shoot ghosts with arrows; chop demons as a samurai; and much more. At the end of each set of stages is a 'remix stage' - in this stage, sections of the previously played stages are combined and thrown at you at random, all while a single song plays.</p>",

The object of the game is to match three or more of the same colored tiles either horizontally or vertically. You can change the color of a tile by selecting it with the cursor, then pressing \"A\". This will make the selected tile closer to the color of the cursor (for example, if you select a red tile when the cursor is blue, the red tile will become purple). There are also two special tiles which can be cleared: one clears all tiles on-screen of one color; the other clears all tiles in an X shape starting from the power up tile.</p>\n<p>There are two modes of play available in <em>Coloris</em>. The first is Clear Mode. In this mode, you're aiming to fill the gauge at the top of the screen. You can do this by clearing tiles. However, if you are too slow to clear tiles, they will begin to turn gray. When there are gray tiles on the screen, the gauge cannot be filled. Gray tiles can be removed by clearing nearby colored tiles.</p>\n<p>The second mode of play in <em>Coloris</em> is Score Mode. Score Mode cannot be cleared - the aim of this mode is to get as high a score as possible, by clearing as many tiles as you can. Score Mode ends when all of your tiles turn gray.</p>",

In single-player, you'll switch between them with the select button and the inactive character will be handled by the AI. There is also a cooperative mode, where a second player links up and you each control a character.</p>\n<p>There are three sets of levels: Green Lantern and Flash, Superman and Wonder Woman and finally Batman and Hawkgirl. The levels are presented in a pseudo-3D fashion with characters able to move along the x and z axes. Levels could have you moving up, left right or down to reach your objective, or stuck in one place with the enemies coming to you.</p>\n<p>The fighting system involves the standard jump and attack button, but also has special attacks that are unique to each character. This attack is controlled by a special meter below the health meter. use of you character's special completely depletes this meter and it cannot be used again until the meter fills back up, which takes several seconds.</p>\n<p>In addition to the main story mode, there is a Watchtower training mode which allows you to use any pair of characters in any level.

        "description": "<p>Soundvoyager is a simple action game which uses stereo sound to achieve goals.  The game is actually a variety of mini-games, which are all based around finding or avoiding something based on its aural location.</p>\n<p>The most frequently encountered game is \"Sound Catcher\".  In this game, you must guide your character left or right as you try to find the sound that you are slowly approaching.  Each time you find a sound, it is layered onto a song, which gradually becomes more complex.  After you find all the sounds, they fade away and you can choose your next path by choosing your final sound from the left or the right.</p>\n<p>Other games include \"Sound Drive\", which places your character on a five-lane freeway.  Based on the sound of the car engines and horn honking, you must avoid crashing into other cars by moving into other lanes.  A variation of this is \"Sound Chase\", where you must try and catch a sound that is running away from you, while simultaneously dodging the cars.  \"Sound Cock\" has players searching for roosters which can be heard clucking, but cannot be seen.  You'll need to move your character around based on the position of the rooster sounds to try and catch them.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Focused on the original trilogy of the Star Wars universe (<em>A New Hope</em>, <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> and <em>The Return of Jedi</em>), the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/30928/lego-star-wars-the-video-game/\">LEGO Star Wars</a> brings some innovations over the first title, making it more similar to its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/23874/lego-star-wars-ii-the-original-trilogy/\">PC and console</a> counterpart than the previous game.</p>\n<p>During the story mode, the player is joined on-screen by two other characters, and can change between them to use their specific skills to proceed. Characters share a life bar of four hearts, with the rate of depletion changing according to each character (a stormtrooper will lose three hearts when hit by a blaster, Vader will take two or three hits before losing one). If a support character is \"dismantled\" by attacks, there's no problem, but letting that happen to the controlled character means a loss of stud points (the game currency), as well as a drop on the \"Super Kit\" gauge, which replaces the Jedi rank evaluation of the previous titles. </p>\n<p>Gameplay has been changed to accommodate the lack of lightsaber battles in the later episodes, and so blasters are a lot more effective and fire faster, but have lost their \"charge\" mode. New flight missions are also included. These are similar to previous Star Wars games, like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Star+Wars:+Return+of+the+Jedi\">Return of the Jedi</a>, and allow the player to attack both Death Stars, skim the surface of the forest moon of Endor in a Speeder, escape from an asteroid field with the <em>Millennium Falcon</em>, or draw wires around the legs of Imperial walkers in Hoth.</p>\n<p>There are three major character classes: droids (unable to fight, but the only ones capable of opening most regular doors during story mode), Jedi (melee fighters capable of interacting with larger objects to uncover hidden studs and with different Jedi powers) and Blaster users, which can fire at an enemy from a distance, as well as assemble smaller objects (like short bridges or door switches).</p>\n<p>Gameplay remains a light jump-and-slash isometric game, with the goal being usually to go from point A to B, while pulling levers somewhere in the level. Like in the first game, the game can not be entirely completed without playing in Free Mode (a near perfect run in Story mode will only complete around 50% of the game), as many doors can only be opened, or even reached, by using the unique special abilities of one of the 36 unlockable characters. </p>\n<p>To acquire characters for Free Play, the player now needs to accomplish three things: earn enough credits (the value of each stud was increased 10 fold), complete a level (to unlock playable characters such as the level variation of Luke or Leia), and get all \"mini kits\" (which replace the \"Death Star Plans\" of the prequel). Characters that can be unlocked include enemies, such as the Tusken Raider or Stormtroopers, or heroic characters, like Yoda. There are also additional items to be bought, including music, palette swaps, new game modes, lightsaber colours and hints.</p>",

Leprechauns, Unicorns, Mermaids: all of these creatures (and more) are real, but living in hiding, away from public view. It's up to the American Dragon to protect them from the Huntsclan, a band of evildoers who have hunted dragonkind and magical creatures for generations.</p>\n<p><em>Rise of the Huntsclan!</em> is a side-scrolling beat-em-up starring Jake Long, from the Disney cartoon series. As Jake, players can beat up evil doers such as trolls, imps harpies and other mischievous creatures out to give Jake a hard time. He can also use his skateboard by holding the R Button to travel more quickly. Jake can also build up his \"focus meter\" by collecting blue orbs - when full, he can briefly transform into the American Dragon, and destroy his foes with powerful fire attacks and flaming breath.</p>\n<p>Jake's friends, Fu Dog, Trixie and Spud, and Grampa can also be summoned in for their own special abilities. As well as this, Jake can select an ability to upgrade at the end of each level, such as how long his transformation lasts, how powerful his various attacks are, or his speed.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Another day in the city of Townsville, and this time, the Powerpuff Girls are off on a scavenger hunt! Ms. Keene has given the girls a list of different items that can be found in the city. Along the way, Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup will run into familiar villains such as Mojo Jojo, Fuzzy Lumpkins, The Gangreen Gang, the Boogie Man, and of course... HIM.</p>\n<p><em>Him and Seek</em> is a side-scrolling adventure game starring the Powerpuff Girls. There's no platforming required in this game, as the girls can fly everywhere. Instead, it plays like a combination of a beat-em-up and a point and click adventure game. The girls will need to perform tasks for Townsville citizens to get items for their scavenger hunt list, ranging from destroying crazy monsters, to finding lost wallets, to beating up the Gangreen Gang to get a tooth!</p>\n<p>Initially, you can only control one girl at a time, attacking with punches and kicks, shooting laser beams, and dashing. However, later the girls decide to team up, and you can switch girls on the fly by pressing the L Button. There are also some cool mini-games, such as an excellent pinball machine, a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dance+Dance+Revolution\">Dance Dance Revolution-like</a> dance-off against the Boogie Man, and a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Frogger\">Frogger</a> parody where you control Mojo Jojo as you help him escape from jail and avoid capture by the Powerpuff Girls.</p>",

In order to do so he joins the adventurous Guntz who is out on a quest to find a mystery character. Along the way they will find new friends with their own quests, which serve as a way to prove Klonoa's heroism. </p>\n<p>The game is played from a top-down perspective and he is able to transform his magic ring in several weapons. When in combat Klonoa has to use the right color attack against an enemy to inflict damage on it. The normal attacks are red and blue, but Klonoa also has a special yellow attack that needs to be charged up first before it is able to be unleashed. Defeated enemies usually drop dream fragments and gold. Collecting dream fragments increases Klonoa's experience and upon level-up the player can select which stats to increase. Gold can be spent at item and armory shops or at inns.</p>\n<p>Occasionally Klonoa will visit locations that are more puzzle focused. In these sections Klonoa will have to eliminate enemies by punching them from the side or back without being seen by any of the enemies in that location. If Klonoa is caught, he will have to start the puzzle over again.</p>",

In addition to this, breath attacks are unlocked as players progress through the game, allowing Spyro to control the elements of fire, ice, earth and lightning. The R Button will let Spyro fire a stream of breath, while the L Button will hurl a ranged attack at foes. Finally, players can press L and R together when their purple Fury Meter is full to unleash a more powerful attack.</p>\n<p><em>A New Beginning</em> also features mini-games such as a whack-a-mole style game, flying levels which play somewhat like a shooter in the vein of games like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=013388110032\">1942</a>. You'll even come across boss battles as you attempt to free the other Guardians from the evil dragon Cynder's forces.</p>",

You view the event from a third person perspective, and have full control of the cross hair. The rest of the events are different. They all use timing meters, one for strength and one for accuracy, where the player has to hit the button at the right spot on the meter. </p>\n<p>Two game modes are available. Practice is the first, where one player can play any of the events at any time, without going through the rest. The second is the tournament where one or two players sharing the same machine can go through all the events. For each event the player will earn points, and there is a high score table for overall scores.</p>",

        "description": "<p>You are a male or female apprentice Craftknight and the Edge Fencer. It is your job to protect the seal trapping Goura, a stray summon creature who is too powerful for anyone to control. Similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/25040/summon-night-swordcraft-story/\">Summon Night: Swordcraft Story</a>, your father died 3 years ago. He died trying to trap Goura after a summoner tried to free Goura and take control of him. Now it is your job to protect that seal, while you are working at becoming a Craftknight.</p>\n<p>A Craftknight is a person who creates weapons and uses them, similar to an armorer. However, these weapons are made with the combined power of your hammer and your Guardian Beast. You will have the ability to choose between 4 Guardian Beasts shortly after starting the game. Each one has different abilities and will have different conversations throughout the game. Unlike in the previous game, you do not learn techniques for making weapons, but instead you use shapestones to create a weapon type. There are 6 weapon types that can be made and you will need at least a basic weapon from each type in order to reach all areas of the game. The actual weapon you create will be determined by the material you use to create it. If you make it with Iron Ore, it will be one kind of weapon, while if you make it with Aqua Ore, it will be another kind of weapon. Later, you will have the ability to upgrade the weapons up to three times each.</p>\n<p>Battles are the same as in the previous game. You fight in a side scrolling area with up to 4 enemies. You can use your weapon to attack, or use your Guardian Beast's magic to attack, heal or protect you, or enchant your weapon in some way. Some weapons will also have special attacks that can do even more damage. In this game, you'll have battles above and below ground, rather than just in the dungeon and arena. You also have the ability to Mono Shift, where you will change into a more powerful being. You can only do this once before recharging the item that allows you to Mono Shift.</p>",

You play as The Flash in a game that plays something like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Final+Fight\">Final Fight</a> on speed.</p>\n<p>An army of robots has invaded Earth, starting with Flash's hometown of Keystone City. Flash must defeat them there as well as other DC Comics' locales such as Metropolis, Gotham City and the Amazon.</p>\n<p>As usual for this genre, you walk from left to right and punch and kick enemies using combo attacks until their life-bar is depleted with an occasional boss-battle. However, this has the added twist of Flash's super speed powers. There is a button to instantly dash to the next enemy and another slows down time, though Flash himself still moves normally, allowing him to run around defeating multiple enemies before they can react.</p>\n<p>While Flash is the only playable character, other Justice League members do have cameo appearances, Black Canary, Superman, Wonder Woman, Martian Manhunter and Green Arrow can all be summoned to proved brief assistance in clearing enemies.</p>\n<p>In addition to the main story mode, there is a boss rush mode, a minigame where you race Superman and a making-of.</p>",

Like the previous GBA releases of the series, it's an isometric representation of the console levels combined with polygonal characters. It contains both a story mode, in which you create a rookie skater and take him or her on a world tour with pros to improve their skills and win prizes; and a classic mode, in which you must accomplish various goals such as tricking off objects or getting a high score within two minutes. Changes in this iteration include removing the timer from most goals in story mode, allowing you to have several active at once and new moves like the nata spin, tantrum, which allows you to recover from a bail without losing everything, focus, where you can slow time in order to land the best trick and sticker-slapping.</p>",

Secretly plotting over the years, they have at last unleashed their armies, ready to take over the world! They've captured Rayman and all of his friends, stolen Rayman's fists, and scattered the precious Lums far and wide! Guess who has to save the day once again?</p>\n<p>Unlike the console version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Rayman+Raving+Rabbids\">Rayman Raving Rabbids</a>, the Game Boy Advance version of the game sticks to its classic side scrolling platformer roots, like the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=3362933400010\">Rayman</a>. Rayman can jump, glide with his hair for short distances, hurl his fists or throw a charged punch, pick up and hurl explosive barrels and other items, and even grapple onto special purple Lums, using them to swing.</p>\n<p>New to <em>Rayman Raving Rabbids</em> is Rayman's ability to gain special powers by changing into different costumes based on musical styles, such as hip-hop, punk, pop and rock. Each costume gives Rayman a specific ability which allows him to reach areas he previously couldn't and defeat enemies.</p>",

He-Man can stop the enemies from advancing upon him by destroying the warp portals that are scattered throughout the area.</p>\n<p>Along the way, He-Man can even ride on Battle Cat through \"shooter\" style levels to get to new areas and face Skeletor's main minions, such as Beast Man and Clawful.</p>\n<p>Masters of the Universe - He-Man: Power of Greyskull uses a password save to mark player's progress throughout the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Eragon for the Game Boy Advance is a traditional turn based RPG with a combat system that emphasizes motion and action.  Players use combinations of spells, melee attacks, and ranged attacks to battle Urgals, thieves, soldiers, and other various enemies.  This is an RPG where combat strategy plays a key role in success.</p>\n<p>Players can make use of the RPG mechanics to create offensive and defensive potions, craft better armor and weapons, learn offensive and defensive spells, or become trackers who are able to find hidden encounters.  This design encourages experimentation, opens up a lot of strategic possibilities, and allows a lot of replayability.</p>\n<p>The player assumes the role of Eragon, a young boy with a mysterious origin and an important future, on his perilous journey to avenge his father, rescue the woman of his dreams and join forces with the Varden in their war against King Galbatorix. On this adventure Eragon encounters many allies; Brom the old wizened story teller, Ayra the elf guard of the dragon egg, Murtagh the orphan with a troubled past, Angela an herbalist witch, and a powerful dragon that will help unveil Eragon's true destiny.</p>",

Goemon (and his pal Ebisumaru in the sequel) can use a wide variety of weapons and items, which can be collected in-game or bought at special stores.</p>\n<p>For the GBA version both games have been updated with a save-game feature, as well as with minor fixes and additions (such as the ability to switch characters on the fly). There's also a new playable character for the second game, new graphic effects and new mini-games which once unlocked can be played directly from the main menu.</p>",

        "description": "<p>On the planet Zi, far away in the universe, there are both good and evil inhabitants. To gain control of the planet, they use mechanized robots called Zoids to battle for control of the world. During an experiment, Zoids warriors from different eras, the Chaotic Century and the New Century, collide. Players take control of Zoids warrior Zeru, who wants to restore the chaos with the help of his friends Van, Fiona and Bit Cloud. There are different types of Zoids to choose from, and each one of them can be upgraded and customized.</p>\n<p>Zeru is given a simple robot and has to participate in tournaments to earn money and collect new ones. He gets to meet Juno who gets kidnapped and a man called Dr. T tells him about the fusion that brought past, present and future together. By fighting in turn-based battles (with up to six-to-six match-ups), the player collects crystals left behind by defeated Zoids that can be turned into new ones by visiting the lab in one of the many towns. There, the robots can be upgraded too in different areas, with defensive and offensive elements, for both long-ranged and melee combat. Prior to each match players define the deck command. This affects the entire team, influencing the cash, salvaged parts or offering the possibilities to fuse all Zoids into a large creature. Each turn offers the player to attack, wait (and regenerate) or use an item. Some Zoids are accompanied by organoids, robot friends, that can fuse into the main Zoid for enhanced abilities.</p>\n<p>The main story mode takes place in 40 villages with 151 base Zoids to collect. There is also a challenge mode with consecutive, increasingly difficult battles, and multiplayer through the link cable. Except for fighting, this mode can also be used to trade Zoids and parts.</p>",

Stitch resolves to save her, and gameplay shifts between the events of both Lilo and Stitch throughout eight levels.</p>\n<p>Stitch's levels are all shooter intensive, similar to games like Metal Slug for the side-scrolling levels, and Gyruss for the shooter levels.  In the side scrolling levels, Stitch blasts everything in his path with his laser pistols and pineapple bombs, until he is eventually able to  find a spaceship and continuing his rescue mission to the Junkyard Planet.  </p>\n<p>Lilo's levels are set in an Out of the World or Flashback style, where Lilo must use stealth, solve puzzles, and use Scrump, her doll, to evade and confuse her alien captors.</p>\n<p>Once Lilo and Stitch find each other, they must escape via an alien tank to stop Dr. Pestus and escape back to Earth.</p>\n<p>Along the way, players can collect stills and small video clips featuring scenes from the movie.  The game uses a password save to continue where players left off.</p>",

The turtles have grown apart, and Raphael has taken to crime fighting solo under the guise of the Nightwatcher. The Foot Clan are turning up in the streets again, and a mysterious man known as Winters seems to be involved with them. Only the Ninja Turtles can clean up the streets!</p>\n<p>The Game Boy Advance version of <em>TMNT</em> can be best described as similar to the NES game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=095303284011\">River City Ransom</a>. Players take control of either a specific turtle or the turtle of their choice (depending on the mission), and fight through waves of enemies in a sidescrolling beat-em-up style. Enemies will drop the usual health pickups, but also drop money and weaponry. Money can be used to purchase weapons or upgrades between missions, while weapons can be used as a more powerful tool to defeat your foes (however, these weapons have a limited use). After the completion of a mission, experience is earned, and after a certain amount of experience is gained, you can level up the turtles to improve their fighting statistics.</p>\n<p>Each turtle has their own specific weapon: Leonardo with his dual Katana, Michelangelo with his Nunchucks, Donatello with his Bo Staff and Raphael with his two Sai. These weapons are used in their standard attacks. A basic attack is performed with the B Button, but you can perform different attacks with B and other buttons such as the directions of the Control Pad and the A Button. Uppercuts, Sweep Kicks, Jump Kicks and more can be performed, and you can even juggle enemies in the air to get more hits in and increase your score.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The CIMA aliens feed on humankind's hopes and dreams. They build elaborate mazes and trap people inside them as a way of producing their food. A force called \"Gate Guardians\" was created to protect the population from this menace. Three Guardians were on a train delivering settlers to a distant station, when suddenly a portal for another dimension appeared and transported everyone to a strange moon-like place. The Guardians must find the way home and bring back safely every passenger.</p>\n<p><em>CIMA: The Enemy</em> combines role-playing and strategy elements. Although labeled a RPG, the game lacks several traditional features of the genre: there is no levelling up, nor any form of currency or shops to buy equipment. Instead, the game is focused on the management of a huge party of characters (16 by the end of the game). The main objective is to guide these civilians on mazes, using their unique abilities to overcome obstacles and defeat enemies. Each character has a special trait that can be used to the player's advantage (a medic that concocts health potions, a blacksmith that upgrades armor and weapons, etc).</p>\n<p>Pressing a button brings up a cross with the party portraits at each point and a multicolor cross on the middle. The characters can be individually guided by selecting their portraits or moved in groups by selecting the multicolor cross. Three way-points can be set for easier manoeuvring (almost a necessity, the characters have a tendency to get stuck on corners and walls). </p>\n<p>One crucial gameplay aspect is the amount of trust the party members have on their Guardians. Each character has a gauge that shows the amount of trust they have. This number increases and decreases according to actions within the game. If a character is hurt his/her trust decreases, and a red heart with an arrow pointing downwards appears over his/her head. Likewise, if a character sees a guardian slaying a monster the opposite effect happens, and a green heart with an upwards arrow appears over his/her head. Trust is important because the characters only cooperate with the Guardians when they have the right amount of it.</p>\n<p>When a party character is about to expire, a jewel is displayed besides the main character's health bar, and an alarm sound is played. Death of any party member ends the game instantaneously.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Fortress</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tetris:+The+Soviet+Challenge\">Tetris</a>-variant puzzle game. As in that classic game, geometric pieces fall from the top of the screen and must be arranged in lines. Only instead of eliminating lines, the objective this time is to add them to the screen. The game starts with a timer (that counts a moment where neither player attack) and a castle gate falling between two flags (the opponent's flags can be seen to the left of the screen). Once placed, the remaining pieces are used to build a castle around it, as every 2x3 grid of pieces transforms into its walls. A grid of 8x3 pieces transforms into a wizard's tower that can summon a creature to attack the enemy castle. </p>\n<p>Certain special blocks add features to the building: a cannon block places a shooting cannon that starts to attack automatically the opponent's fortress. A block with a window adds one to the building. Repairing peons come out of it to help fix the damage to the castle's walls. A block with a bomb adds a cannon that fires a peon towards the opponent's castle (an aiming reticule is shown over the enemy castle to help choose the right spot). Building walls around these special blocks prevent their destruction from the enemy attack. A monster appears randomly at the bottom of the screen to attack both players.</p>\n<p>The player's goal at each level is to reach a number of score points before the opponent. The pieces can be maneuvered with the digital pad, and pressing <strong>UP</strong> on it makes them fall fast downwards. They can be rotated clockwise and anti-clockwise with the <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> buttons, respectively. Holding the <strong>R</strong> trigger allows the player to move the screen with the digital pad (for a full view of battle scene). When pressed, the <strong>L</strong> trigger destroys the top 3 rows of your castle and decreases the score.</p>\n<p>The game has three game modes: tournament, battle and blitz. They vary in the amount of seconds on the timer and the goal score. There are four themes: pre-historic, medieval, pirate and space.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Open Season</em> for GBA is based on the film, and is quite different from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=open+season\">console version</a>. The story in this version mostly follows the movie. A grizzly bear named Boog is very happy with his domesticated home. One day, he gets in trouble with a one-antlered mule deer named Elliot, and the town's authority decides to put them back in the woods where they belong. Unfortunately for them, the hunting season has just begun, and Boog has no idea how to survive outside of his garage home with his beloved caretaker Beth, a park ranger who raised Boog since he was a little cub. </p>\n<p>The game begins just before Boog and Elliot are dropped in the woods. The player controls Boog, who has various moves at his disposal. He can jump, roll, grab and throw forest animals, as well as roar. The goal of the game is to protect the forest animals from the hunters, who all work for Shaw, a hunting fanatic who wants to kill Boog and Elliot. The forest is full of hunters and boss hunters in each animal territory. It is the player's job to scare them off and clean up the forest.</p>",

Set on the island of Voya Nui, they need to retrieve the Mask of Life, stolen by the Piraka gang who also enslaved the Matoran, the native inhabitants, in the process. Unlike the console and the DS versions, a top-down perspective is used.</p>\n<p>The game takes place on six zones of the island, followed by a final showdown. The player starts as a Toa of Fire, but by completing zones and killing the level boss, additional masks can be collected: Air, Stone, Ice, Earth and Water. Each Toa has a primary and secondary weapon based on the mask's elemental nature, with specific features. During the levels, there are also weapon upgrades to be found. The second weapon is limited by an energy meter which needs some time to recharge. Each zone requires a specific Toa guise, but in the Free Play mode completed levels can be revisited and players can then switch between the forms at any time to use different abilities. Toa can strafe while fighting - there is an option to face enemies automatically or to control this manually.</p>\n<p>Toa are assisted by proto-spawn orbs, sidekicks that circle around the hero and fire at enemies. The orbs are chased off when they take too much damage, but they can also be upgraded based on the 6 elements and the weapons can be customized. Players can define to have the orbs fire in spread patterns or rapid bursts, lock on targets with fire, cause explosions, fire through shields or do double damage. Additional attacks are provided through elemental runes, which provide a one-time limited effect, such as freezing enemies, activating a lightning shield, smashing enemies with spikes from the ground, temporary invulnerability, full health and regeneration, and a fire blast.</p>\n<p>By destroying objects and buildings in the environment, blue, gray or gold LEGO pieces are revealed, providing health and bonus points. The Toa also need to use pieces to build bridges, platforms, elevators, turrets, barricades or moving platforms. At the end of each zone, the rank and score is shown. Based on the performance or specific actions, there are 12 medals to collect, of which a few can only be found in the Free Play mode.</p>\n<p>Each zone contains secret cheat words. Upon discovering them, they are added to a cheat menu. They allow to play as a golden Toa or to obtain a new mask with a sombrero, open up a music jukebox, provide a hidden Cluck gun or grant invincibility or one-shot kills.</p>",

You take the role of a young craftsknight (a combination of knight and weaponsmith) whose master has been recently murdered. His guardian creature appears to you and admits to being responsible for his death, and joins you to try to atone for its sins as you attempt to unravel the conspiracy that caused his death and also finish your training.</p>\n<p>As the other games in the series the game is a top-down action RPG in which you explore the game world talking to NPCs for items and clues and dungeon-crawl to gather the materials needed to create your weapons. When in combat, the game switches to a side-scrolling view in which you attack and attempt to avoid your enemies attacks in real-time. Additionally you can now summon creatures and control them in all battles to take advantage of their enhanced abilities.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Gremlins: Stripe vs Gizmo</em> is a 2D side-scrolling platformer based on the popular film series. Christmas has come to Kingston Falls, and depending on which character is chosen, can either save or destroy the holiday. Players can choose to play between Gizmo, the furry, friendly Mogwai, or Stripe, the mischievous, and foul-tempered Gremlin. </p>\n<p>Playing through five levels, Gizmo's intent is to save all of the Christmas presents and return them to their rightful children. While doing this, Gizmo must also escape from the evil Gremlins that are trying to capture him and force him to eat after midnight - turning him into a Gremlin. Gizmo uses his double-jump and flashlight to ward off attacks, or can roll into a ball and knock over enemies.</p>\n<p>Playing as Stripe, it is the player's goal to destroy as many presents as possible. Players can capture Mogwais and turn them into Gremlins by hitting them with a cream pie. Stripe can also attack by using his claws.</p>\n<p><em>Gremlins: Stripe Vs. Gizmo</em> offers three distinct game modes: Adventure Mode, an \"Against-the-Clock\" Mode and a Multiplayer Mode (two players can compete in real time with link mode).</p>",

He uses his money to build a ship and head out over the great sea to explore lands unknown. However, the same day he is celebrating his birthday, a great tidal wave rises up and destroys his boat. Torneko, along with his wife and son, are recovered by the villagers of a small island. In gratitude, Torneko agrees to help them with the monster problem they've been having from a Mysterious Dungeon nearby cave. And as usual, he will try to discover rare and valuable items in the cave which he can use to reestablish his fortune.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Boundish is a series of five different two player games, mostly based around the very first video game ever made, Pong. You can choose to play these games either versus a CPU opponent, or head-to-head against another player. Player one is always red, and player two is always blue. The games are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pool Flower</strong>  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Two players bounce a ball left and right between each other, aiming to get it past the opposing player to score a point. Players can move up and down the entirety of the screen, as well as forward and back about a third of the screen. Circles of varying size float around the screen - if these are hit, they turn the same color as the last player who hit the ball away.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Box Juggling</strong>  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The odd game out of the bunch - this game is instead based on Nintendo's very first Game &amp; Watch game, Ball. One player walks left and right at the bottom of the screen, keeping a box in the air. If the box hits the ground, it's game over. Pressing A makes the player push the box back in the air - if the player hits the box with their head, it still counts as a hit, but the player is briefly stunned. Power ups and additional boxes appear as the game progresses to keep things different.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Power Slider</strong>  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Two players stand around the edge of a binocular-shaped field. They bounce a puck between each other, and each time it bounces, it leaves a hole in the playfield. Players can hold the A Button and let it go just as the puck approaches them to perform a power shot. Players hug their circular side of the playfield to take shots at the puck.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Human League</strong>  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The screen is divided into two sides, and two human-shaped paddles are on each side. The game plays somewhat like doubles tennis, in that if the first player misses the ball, the second player has a chance to recover it. Using Up and Down moves both players (the second player moves more slowly), while Left and Right moves the player closer to the net only. Pressing A while holding Up or Down will make the outer player make a dash for the corner in that direction.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wild Go Round</strong>  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>This game has the two players rotating around a vinyl record. The goal is to get the opponent to drop the ball off the record. Each time a player hits the ball, the record rotates, and the label changes color. If the label is the same color as your player, you will score a point. The record's rotation also affects the movement of the ball.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The wedding anniversary for Penny Proud's parents is close, and that means its time to get them a present! Penny made something herself, but her friends said that she should get them a T.H.A.N.G.(or Total Home Automated Necessity Gizmo) instead. It's very expensive, but much cheaper if you buy it in pieces and self-assemble it. So Penny needs to spend time working jobs to get enough money to buy it.</p>\n<p>The video game for <em>The Proud Family</em> can best be described as a side-scrolling adventure game. Players navigate through Penny's neighborhood, being informed of odd jobs that Penny can take to earn money. Anything from picking up litter to working at the local Pizza Parlor, to finding neighbors' lost dogs on the streets. Once Penny has earned enough money for a T.H.A.N.G. part, she can go to the store to buy it, and then the next chapter begins.</p>\n<p>The game also has mini-games which are based around Penny's official 'jobs' that she receives. For example, she works for her dad at his factory, combining various snacks to please three different judges. Another mini-game has Penny competing in a dance-off. And at Chez Wizard, she has to take up a waitress job, where she greets and seats customers, takes their orders, delivers their food, takes the payment, and clears the dirty dishes. On top of this, it all has to be done quickly to satisfy the customers!</p>\n<p>Certain areas in the game also present themselves as photo opportunities. If Penny stands close enough to a star marker and presses the R Button, she'll get a photo of one of the characters from the show that will be stored in her photo album. If she's not close enough, she'll just get a fuzzy photo of a UFO instead.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Naruto: Ninja Council</em> is another game that was taken from a famous Japanese anime series and is also the first installment of the Ninja Council series. </p>\n<p>It's a side scrolling, action oriented game with two modes to choose - Story mode and Free mode - and two playable characters. The story of Ninja Council starts from the survival exam and ends with Orochimaru\u2019s attack at the Hidden Konoha Village. Apart from that there are no actual events between that - that take place on the anime although there are fights with certain characters that do like the fight with Haku and Orochimaru.</p>\n<p>The characters that are available are Naruto and Sasuke. When you start a new game at the beginning of each stage Kakashi sensei appears to give you hints about the controls and other useful staff like a boss\u2019 weak point or attack patterns. There are also hidden characters you can find who can restore your health when you run out of life. Stages have a time limit of 5 minutes to complete. At the end of each stage there is a boss fight and the timer resets at 5 minutes in which you have to win the battle in order to advance the game and be able to save your progress.</p>\n<p>The two available characters - Naruto and Sasuke - can both use the same combo hits and weapons that can be picked up in each stage like shuriken and kunai. Every second stage the player will also find scrolls that contain elemental power ups like the Lightning Style Scroll that can be used either for attacking opponents or for progressing in the game. Apart from that each one has a set of three unique special attacks that can be used but only if you have sufficient amount of chakra.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Trouble at Stark Enterprises: Tony Stark aka Iron Man finds that one of his Iron Man suits has been stolen. Given enough time, the thief might be able to reverse engineer the technology and use it to find weaknesses to exploit or, even worse, duplicate it and use it for sinister purposes. Thankfully, each suit is outfitted with a locator beacon. Tony slips into one of his remaining suits and sets out to get the stolen suit back and find out who is behind the theft.</p>\n<p>Iron Man's quest will take him through a number of large levels in a side-scrolling platformer. His primary weapon against the many enemies awaiting him is the repulsor blast fired from the gauntlets of the suit. Another attack is a quick shoulder tackle. The boot jets of the suit allow Iron Man to get to places not reachable with a normal jump.</p>\n<p>Firing the repulsor blast depletes the energy supply of the suit. The supply slowly recharges on its own, but a quicker way to regain spent energy is finding energy powerups. Other powerups include health boosts and some special weapons.</p>\n<p>At the end of some levels, boss battles await. Between the levels, comic-style cutscenes continue the storyline.</p>",

Choose from four up and coming riders, and compete in the Ibex, Glyder and Kotsu Leagues to become the ultimate champion!</p>\n<p><em>Trick Star</em> is a futuristic racing game where the racers ride slick one-wheeled bikes. Players race along the track, with the goal of not only coming first, but also performing stunts to impress the crowds. Stunts cannot be performed until a certain speed is reached, and the \"Trick Star\" appears on the HUD. When it appears, players can perform a stunt by holding L or R, as well as any direction on the Control Pad. Performing stunts also fills your boost meter - when it is full, you can press L and R simultaneously to get an extra boost.</p>\n<p>In League Mode, players must complete three tracks, as well as scoring enough points to qualify for the Challenge Mode. Once the player has enough points, they can enter Challenge Mode, where they are asked to perform a particular set of stunts in between markers. When they succeed, they are rewarded with additional stunts and progress to the next set of tracks.</p>\n<p><em>Trick Star</em> also includes one player at a time multiplayer, for up to four players. Players can compete in Time Trial (aim for the fastest time), Stunts (get the highest stunt point score), Long Jump (jump the longest distance along the track) and Challenges (complete the required challenges). After each player has had a go, the results are shown.</p>",

You take control of a young man who, after a series of events, finds himself in possession of a new type of L.E.V. (a giant combat robot) and stranded on Mars, where he joins forces with the Anti-Terrestrial League.</p>\n<p><em>Zone of the Enders: The Fist of Mars</em> is a side-story in the <em>Zone of the Enders</em> series. The gameplay alternates between story sequences and tactical turn-based combat, in which the player controls a number of L.E.V.s on a square grid map. There are different types of L.E.V.s that differ in speed, durability, movement range and armament. Unlike close ranged weapons, long range weapons cannot be used after an L.E.V. has already been moved. When two units engage in combat, the I.A.S. (interactive action system) comes into play. When attacking, the player is given a limited amount of time to move a cross-hair over your target. Critical hits can be delivered by successfully aiming at certain weak-spots of your enemies. When attacked by an enemy, the player must try to keep his/her own target icon away from the enemy's. The IAS can be toggled on and off in the options menu.</p>\n<p>At the end of each chapter the player is able to upgrade the controlled L.E.V.s or equip them with certain items that can sometimes be found during missions. The \"balance\" sub-screen allows to determine whether an L.E.V. should focus on attack power or accuracy, evasion or minimizing damage.</p>",

Jimmy will need to travel between different dimensions to make his way home and confront Negatron himself. </p>\n<p>In <em>The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius Vs. Jimmy Negatron</em>, you control Jimmy Neutron as he battles his evil alter ego, Jimmy Negatron, to try and put Retroville back to normal. The game is presented in a 3rd Person perspective using Mode 7 (similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=045496830144\">Super Mario Kart</a>) and pre-rendered graphics to give the illusion that the player is in a fully 3D world. As Jimmy travels through eleven different dimensions, he uses many different gadgets including the shrink ray, the robot disassembling ray, the dimension jump ray, the rocket ship and, of course, his robot dog, Goddard.</p>\n<p>The game also features two different multiplayer games: War of Electrons and Collecting Coins, both which can be played with up to two players.</p>",

        "description": "<p>During the 1960's, a Canadian named Logan was used in a government-conducted experiment known as Weapon X. Unbreakable adamantium was ingested into his bones, in an attempt to turn him into a \"super-soldier\". For the rest of his life, Logan (who adopted the nickname Wolverine) will have to fight against the beast inside him. Only after meeting Professor Xavier and his X-Men team, Wolverine is able to find a purpose in his life. However, as his memories return, he realizes that the Weapon X experiment has infected him with a deadly virus, and he has only two days to find the cure.</p>\n<p>Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9023/x2-wolverines-revenge/\">console and computer game</a> of the same name, this version of <em>X2: Wolverine's Revenge</em> is a side-scrolling platformer. Wolverine mostly uses his most powerful weapon, the adamantium claws, to strike enemies with. With the claws unsheathed, he can enter an even more devastating \"Rage Mode\", achieved after the player repeatedly taps a button. Other abilities include dashing, clinging on walls and ceilings, and sliding to avoid taking falling damage. By pressing down a button, the player can also have the super-hero regenerate his health if he stands still.</p>\n<p>Beside straightforward combat against regular enemies and bosses, the game also features stealth segments, during which Wolverine will have to traverse a stage unnoticed. He has a special stealth attack at his disposal, which will silently and instantly kill an unsuspecting enemy. Some levels also require the player to find specific items (such as keys) to proceed.</p>",

The game uses an isometric perspective, and its levels differ in structure and design from those of the other release. One of the most notable differences is the exclusion of a second playable character. There are also fewer playable characters in this version, and fewer stages. Cutscenes are presented as still pictures. Blaster-using characters can charge the shot to pierce through several enemies; however, characters also have a reduced ability to deflect blaster shots.</p>",

The look and feel is alike, although it's simplified in its gameplay mechanics. It is also not a huge departure in comparison to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6398/the-sum-of-all-fears/\">original version</a>, but obviously converted to a top-down perspective.</p>\n<p>The game's story is built around the Tom Clancy book with the same title. You take control of a team of elite fighters trained for hostage rescue and anti-terror operations. Each and every team member is the best of the best. The first mission is to recapture a TV station seized by terrorists who broadcast their demands into the world. They have hostages, too, so you need to ensure that no-one gets hurt. But that's only the beginning of a global campaign against terrorism taking in 15 missions, each with a secondary and primary objective.</p>\n<p>In this version, there are various team members to choose from which vary in their statistics (e.g. stealth, aim or reflex), and equipment. You can't make your own mission plans or switch between the team members (the others follow automatically and can't be given commands), so it comes down to controlling a team member, shooting every terrorist you see and performing various tasks (disarming security systems etc.). After finishing the campaign, the game unlocks the \"Lone Wolf\" mode which allows to replay the game with only one team member.</p>",

Tyrannus is bent on a \"Holy Mission\" to purify the Lost Land through slaughter and misery.</p>\n<p>During the fight with your nemesis Captain Tobias Bruckner in 1886 Texas, you were injured and sucked in to the Lost Lands. After recovering in the village, you discover that Tyrannus appoints a new general to his armies \u2013Bruckner. So you begin the war in a land of lush jungles, suspended cities, mysterious temples, reptile armies, and towering dinosaurs.</p>\n<p>In the Game Boy Advance version of the game, you can choose to play solo or with a friend as you battle your way through hordes of hideous monsters. The game plays like a side-scrolling action game, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Contra\">Contra</a>.</p>",

As always, the player skates around several parks (loosely based on <em>American Wasteland</em>'s levels) and performs a variety of stunts. Those are executed by combining the environment with certain button combinations.</p>\n<p>During the main story mode, the player creates a new skater who gets caught up with a skater group which wants to revive a legendary skate park named SK8Land. In practice, the player walks around the park, talks to people and receives challenges to complete; usually in the form of chained stunts. Classic mode allows to take control over real skaters and freely roam the parks. In this mode, the goal is to accumulate as many points as possible by performing spectacular stunts within a time limit. Additionally there are various multiplayer modes, unchanged from the predecessors, for link-cable and hot seat.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In 2002, a major motion picture based on the classic comic book co-created by Stan Lee was released. This conversion of the movie to the video game world is loosely based on the storyline and characters of the movie. The Green Goblin is the main villain here, and as Peter Parker the player must defy gravity using spider crawl and web-slinging abilities to track down Spidey's nemesis through the skyscrapers of New York City.</p>\n<p>This version of <em>Spider-Man</em> is mostly a traditional side-scrolling platformer. The goals of the twelve main levels reach from simply reaching the end to rescuing civilians or disarming bombs. Those latter objectives are usually not on the main path and result in a time limit. Of course each level ends with a boss fight against a villain known from the comics. There are power-ups to collect, mostly upgrades to the web abilities, and photos to take: when reaching certain parts of the level, the game gives notice and the player quickly has to press the select button. This unlocks movie stills in a photo gallery.</p>\n<p>There are also 3D bonus levels in which the camera is fixed behind Spidey's back as he swings through the city.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>NFL Blitz 20-02</em> is a game based on the American Football sport. As the whole series, it takes away most rules and tactics (leaving 36 offensive and 18 defensive plays) while focusing on an action oriented approach. Because of the limited control scheme of the system, the options on the field are less in comparison to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5314/nfl-blitz-20-02/\">main console version</a>: besides the usual movement, passing and player moving commands, the player also may tackle, leap or activate a turbo boost. The playing perspective is an angled pseudo-3D view with the goals at the top/low side of the screen.</p>\n<p>Both in the exhibition and season mode (17 weeks), the game offers the choice between 32 teams with different statistics regarding passing, defensive and line. The mini games, which can be also selected from the main menu, are basically practice modes for field goal and goal-line situations as well as a NFL trivia quiz.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This is the second Naruto title for the <em>Ninja Council</em> series and follows the adventures of Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura as they try to pass the Chunin Exam in a total of seven stages.</p>\n<p>Unlike the first title you can now control three characters by changing them anytime you want inside the game. Each one has unique sequences of punches and kicks and can use 3 special techniques with varying results from one character to another. The shuriken, kunai and fuma from the first game are still here although this time one hit is enough to dispatch an enemy. Along the stages you can also find summoning scrolls and use them in fights to call Kakashi, Choji and others to attack the enemies. Another addition to the gameplay is the Teleport move which as the name implies allows you to teleport near or behind an enemy to attack him or simply dodge his attacks. At parts of each stage you may be given certain objectives such as to defeat all the enemies or finish the stage within a time limit and parameters like the use of only one character. At the end of each stage you get a grade depending on how many enemies you killed, how fast you finished the stage, how many characters you are left and how many leaves you have collected. At the end of the game these grades will be accumulated to decide your final rank.</p>\n<p>The game also features two additional modes \u2013 the Co-op Mode and the Vs. Mode but you need the link cable for that.</p>",

This game allows you to take the role of a Machop who has the respectable workload of one hundred boulders ahead of him. </p>\n<p>Boulders will bounce from the left and right sides of the screen. Some will make little bounces along the ground that you wont be able to avoid, others describe parabolas which offer significant head room. If Machop gets beaned by one of the flying rocks the game is over, will you survive all one hundred? You'll be rewarded by an evolution to Machoke at fifty boulders smashed, and Machamp at one hundred.</p>\n<p>The A button does a punch in the direction you are facing while B punches upward.</p>",

How high a score can you get?</p>\n<p>The game can be accessed by scanning the long dot-code on the Pokemon-e Aquapolis cards Pupitar (56/147), Tyranitar (40/147), Kangaskhan (88/147), Larvitar (89/147), and Onix (98/147). Or in Japan Pokemon e-card expansion 3 cards Pupitar (60/87), Larvitar (59/87), Tyranitar (70/87), Onix (56/87), and Kangaskhan (64/87).</p>",

Unfortunately his arm is all worn out from throwing them so far in the first place, so his tosses are falling just shy of the water. Luckily a heliotrope blob with a caricature of a face, Ditto, arrives on the scene. This rubbery creature is able to bounce the pok\u00e9fish just far enough to make it back to their watery homes.</p>\n<p>The directional pad will allow you to move left and right so as to catch the fish on dittos back. As your score increases so will the speed that Kingler will throw the water Pok\u00e9mon. The goal of the game is to try to get the highest score you can. After you miss three fish the game ends.</p>\n<p>The game can be accessed by scanning the long dot-code on the Pokemon-e Skyridge cards, Ditto (51/144), Granbull (61/144), Snubbull (101/144).

For the pink little puff to make it there she will need to leap onto dandelion seeds that float by. Most of these tufts slowly sink once you land, although some will still push their way heavenward. Miss a jump though and you'll end up as Ekans food. </p>\n<p>The way to raise your score is to make fantastic leaps and to get to the next tuft, and to cross the gorge as quickly as possible. An arrow will appear in the lower left hand corner of the screen with a number indicating how far away from your target you are. Should this arrow be flashing this means you are too low and will crash into the cliff face.</p>\n<p>The game can be accessed by scanning the long dot-code on the Pokemon-e Skyridge cards, Cleffa (48/144), Rattata (90/144), Shuckle (96/144), and Yanma (116/144). Or in Japan the Pokemon e-card expansion 4 cards Yanma (10/88), Cleffa (66//88), Schukle (14/88), and Rattata (60/88).</p>",

The story takes place directly after the events of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/15796/boktai-2-solar-boy-django/\">Boktai 2</a>. Sealed up by the Lunar family long ago the ancient being Vanargand has been awakened and is now attempting to use Django's old acquaintance Sabata for his evil schemes. It is once again up to Django to clean up this mess, in order to achieve one of four possible endings.</p>\n<p>As in its two predecessors the striking feature is once again the solar sensor that is implemented in the cartridge. Its main purpose is to use sunlight as ammo for the solar gun \"Gun del Sol\", making its comeback from the first game. Gameplay changes depending on if the game is played in the sun and how intense the sunlight is. For example, water disappears, light shines through the ceiling of dungeons or hidden passages become visible once the solar sensor detects sunlight.</p>\n<p>Aside for the aforementioned sunlight elements, the gameplay consists mainly of classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Zelda+series\">Zelda</a>-like puzzle solving and a few stealth-action elements. For the first time in the series the game includes arcade-like driving sequences on a motorbike, which can be upgraded with various parts, improving its performance. By frequently hitting enemies the Trance gauge can be filled, allowing the player to transform into either Sol Django or Black Django, giving him special attacks. The motorbike mini-game can be played competitively with two players.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dynasty Warriors Advance</em> is a Game Boy Advance adaptation of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dynasty+Warriors\">Dynasty Warriors</a> franchise. Based on the \"Three Kingdoms period\" of ancient China, it takes place at the end of the Han Dynasty during 190 A.D. As the previous government collapses, warlords rise up and fight among one another, eventually establishing three powerful kingdoms: Wei, Wu and Shu. Generals from each of these nations spend the next 100 years fighting among one another, each trying to become the dominant power.</p>\n<p><em>Dynasty Warriors Advance</em> is a top-down turn-based strategy board game, but with a focus on action combat. Since it is based on the earlier <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dynasty+Warriors\">Dynasty Warriors</a> titles, many of the same concepts carry over. Players begin by choosing one of three available characters from the lands of either Wu, Shu or Wei. Each character has their own unique storyline and missions. A briefing is given for each mission detailing specific objectives before allowing the player to equip themselves with weapons and skills at the camp. Once begun, the player moves the designed number of spaces (determined by movement) around the \"board\". If an enemy player is encountered, the game shifts to a top-down action fighting mode. Here the player uses one button to attack, another button to charge and another to unleash a misou special attack once it is powered up. Misou energy is charged by successful attacking enemy units. The player's success against the enemy unit will determine the unit's \"heath\" and will be destroyed completely if all of it's units are destroyed. Some enemy units contain not just soldiers but enemy generals who have their own special moves and greater health. Many missions feature specific objectives rather than just defeating all enemies.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dragon Ball: Advanced Adventure</em> follows the exploits of young Goku as he sets out for the first time to seek the legendary Dragon Balls. Based on the earliest manga chapters (before the series turned into <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/2330/dragon-ball-z-series/\">Dragon Ball Z series</a>), players fight their way through platform levels, bashing countless goons and bosses inspired by pivotal events and characters from the series.</p>\n<p>While the game's levels are straightforward brawls, special duels and tournament sequences play like classic fighting games, albeit with simplified controls. Goku can punch, kick and use his magic staff. After a certain point in the game, getting the Flying Nimbus, he receives the ability to engage into air combat. After completing the story mode, duel characters become available for customizable one-on-one bouts. Additional characters and mini-games can be unlocked by satisfying special requirements, e.g. completing the story mode unlocks Goku's fiend Krillin as a playable character.</p>",

However, someone traces down a black book and recites the words that unleash a horde of demons, vanquishing the humans. Some are kept alive as guinea pigs in dark experiments. One of their subjects, the nameless protagonist, managed to escape. He has been infused with a demonic essence that robs him from his human form, but grants him super strength and the ability to turn flesh into stone.</p>\n<p>The game provides at least a 10 to 15 hour-playing time, peppered with cinematics and dialogues. There are various objects throughout the quest in order to solve many enigmas and obtain magical powers. When things get harder, a small friendly helper will show up and guide the player through the dangerous world.</p>\n<p>This GBA game comes on a 32 Mb cartridge and offer about 20 different environments (desert, villages, ice lands, mazes, forest, swamp, lost cities\u2026). Each environment has its own specificities of experiences and interactions (wind, water, sliding, moving pavement\u2026).

        "description": "<p><em>Taiketsu</em> is another game adaptation that is based on the famous <em>Dragon Ball</em> manga series that were written and illustrated by Akira Toriyama. The current <em>Dragon Ball</em> game features the following options: \n* <strong>One Player</strong>: Option that allows you to compete as one of the 15 <em>Dragon Ball</em> fighters in the modes available.\n+ Tournament: You start with 7 fighters but can unlock more to reach a total of 15. All fighters have the same combos and moves (like block, throws, ki blasts, etc.) and a set of 3 unique attacks that do more damage to the opponents. There\u2019s also a combo of buttons that if pressed allows the battle to take place on the air. When on air you can\u2019t use any of your current fighter\u2019s moves but instead you must press rapidly the buttons that appear at the bottom of the screen in order to inflict damage to the opponent. When completing this mode you either get money as a prize or a new character is unlocked.\n+ Endurance: Mode in which you have to fight a set number of opponents with only one life bar.\n+ Time Challenge: Just like <em>Tournament</em> mode you fight a number of opponents with the exception that here you must do the least possible time. Again just like the <em>Tournament</em> mode if you complete the <em>Time Challenge</em> you either get money as a prize or unlock a new character.\n+ Sparring: Here you can select any of the fighters and practice their moves.\n+ Endurance 2x: Same as <em>Endurance</em> mode apart from the number of opponents which is doubled this time. The current mode is unlocked via the <em>Z-Store</em>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Multiplayer</strong>: By teaming up with another player via the link cable you can fight two opponents controlled by the CPU.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Z-Store</strong>: The place where you can spend the money you have earned to buy images, character bios, bonus settings (make both fighters invisible, one hit instant death and others), etc.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p>Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation 2 is a strategy RPG in which players lead a small force of mechs in a fight to save humanity from an alien invasion. The designs of the mechs, pilots, and attacks are heavily influenced by anime. </p>\n<p>The combat system of this game is similar to its predecessor. The player controls multiple mechs and issues commands in a turn-based fashion. Each mech pilot has \"spirit commands\" that can be used to strengthen a mechs abilities such as its hit or dodge rate. After moving a unit, the player is usually given the option to attack an enemy with an attack from a list. After all of the player's mechs have been moved, the AI gets a turn to move its mechs. If a player mech is attacked, the player has the option of counter-attacking, attempting to evade, or defending.</p>\n<p>Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation 2 does include a few minor changes to the battle system. For one thing, a new attack type (known as a chain attack) allows a unit to strike multiple enemies in a single blow. Also, the AI has been vastly improved.</p>\n<p>The graphics of Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation 2 have been enhanced from the graphics of the original. Attacks from mechs now have a more fluid motion and are generally more interesting to look at.</p>\n<p>The game's story picks up six months after the original Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation left off. Most people on Earth are still trying to recover from the battle with the Aerogaters, but a small remaining faction of the Divine Crusaders is still trying to further their goals. Once again, it's up to the SRX and ATX teams of the EFA to put a stop to their activities and restore order. However, they are soon interupted by two new groups of mysterious enemies: the Einsts and the Inspectors.</p>",

As a whole, it is part of the larger <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Jikky%C5%8D+Powerful+Pro+Yaky%C5%AB\">Jikky\u014d Powerful Pro Yaky\u016b</a> series also developed for the main console systems.</p>\n<p>The game includes a Success mode, where the baseball sequences are combined with a larger storyline introducing simulation and role-playing elements. Generally, the aim is to train a weak player to become one of the best, mixed with different intrigues. In this version, the player's character was once a famous high school baseball player who got killed. A doctor resurrected him as a robot and now he needs to go to three stages to regain his status. The first phase requires the character to get drafted with a team, in the second he needs to earn money to earn a life-long battery and the third and final phase requires acquiring a memory level of more than 80%. The character can go to his former high school and duel rivals in different mini-games.</p>\n<p>The player's character has HP, a stress bar and a memory bar, which are affected by various events. The player can do jobs to earn money and power-ups, restore health, date a girlfriend, train or mediate, suffer from illness or emotional trauma, and there is even an inventory with items and a screen with all the acquired abilities.</p>\n<p>Other modes are Exhibition, Arrange (create custom teams), Data and different mini-games. Playing against other people using a link cable is supported. The customization options are extensive, ranging from the amount of control the computer is given (hitting, pitching, running players, switching and fielding) to the different team and player statistics. Games consists of several innings where the player takes turns hitting and pitching. Most of the traditional game rules are followed.</p>",

The game features two main game modes: quick race and championship. In quick race, players can alone, against another human player or create custom courses for the game. This is further divided into versus games against the computer and time attack. The game can also connect through mobile phones to check global rankings, enter local ranking entries, and download ghosts and new courses.</p>\n<p>In the championship mode, players need to complete the courses in a fixed order while a ranking is kept. The cars are shown from a third-person perspective and there are different AI-controlled racers to beat. Prior to the races, players can do free runs, qualify and eventually start the race or tune the car further. There are two weather types, sunny and rainy, which affects the handling of the cars.</p>\n<p>There are different cars and courses to choose from, with extensive tuning options based on the gear ratio, steering, brakes, tires, aerodynamic settings and the height handicap. There are also three difficulty levels.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>JGTO Kounin Golf Master: Japan Golf Tour Game</em> is the first in the genre to appear on the GBA platform as one of the Japanese launch games. The game features 14 characters and multiple courses with different themes and with about 20 holes each. There is a match mode to go against AI-controlled players to beat their ranking or another mode for just one player.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is divided into two different parts. Players use a top-down overview to track the ball and the hole, while the putting and swinging is done from a third-person perspective. Taking the wind into account, players can choose from different clubs, determine the direction and finally the strength of the shot based on a moving bar requiring the player's timing for accuracy. Obstacles on the course such as sand or trees influence the shots and there are also different weather conditions. In the match mode games are announced by a TV anchor. The game keeps detailed statistics of the score and the player's handicap. Courses and new characters are unlocked gradually.</p>\n<p>Most of the game's content was later used in the US GBA game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/39692/espn-final-round-golf-2002/\">ESPN Final Round Golf 2002</a> with some minor differences.</p>",

The levels are mostly puzzles, where you can only access certain areas with a certain character, so all playable characters must work together to all reach the end. Each character has special abilities, such as Shrek's ground pound to break through pits in the ground.</p>\n<p>You will encounter many different AI types throughout gameplay, including evil witches, arrow-shooting guys, gnomes, etc. There are collectible faeries in each level that you must collect enough of to progress to the next world. </p>\n<p>This is a simple platformer-puzzle game that is mostly geared towards children, seeing as there are no lives, and relatively simple combat, but it should also appeal to adults who enjoy the Shrek franchise.</p>",

Levels consist of either traditional sink-the-ball mini-golf holes or levels with objects that must be broken by the ball. Hammy the squirrel must run around levels to move objects so that the path to the hole is clear, while other movie characters actually hit the ball. Players must complete each hole at or under par in order to unlock Challenge Mode, which consists of harder levels.</p>\n<p>The game also consists of a single cartridge multiplayer mode where players pass the GBA to up to 3 other players to compete against each other.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The GBA version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=5021290024168\">Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend</a> is a side-scrolling platform game more similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=788687400220\">DS version</a> instead of the 3D console versions by a different development studio. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Lara+Croft+Tomb+Raider:+The+Prophecy\">previous GBA game</a> in the series, a side view is used instead of more titled, overhead camera perspective.</p>\n<p>The plot is the same as the console versions. In a search for the relic Lara Croft travels through Japan, Bolivia, England, Kazakhstan, Ghana and the Himalayas. She get some new tools in this game to help her during the search for the relic. The PDA for instance, provides real-time statistics and updates on objectives. The grapple hook can be used to swing over pits and also captures enemies. A headset is used to keep contact with Zip who follows Lara through the cam and informs her about new objectives when they become available.</p>\n<p>Lara can also jump, attack with her guns, and she needs to swing to new platforms, avoid obstacles and take out enemies and animals in her way. Timing and precision is essential to reach platforms, much like the early <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Prince+of+Persia\">Prince of Persia</a> games. New guns are collected when enemies drop them, but this does not change the sprite of the weapon Lara is holding. There are also a number of vehicle sequences where Lara is driving a bike.</p>\n<p>The cut-scenes that progress the story are shown as pages from a comic book, with bubble dialogue. After collecting treasure, it can be exchanged in the main menu to unlock a number of mini-games, cinematics, character profiles, cheat codes and a time trial mode to complete levels as fast as possible.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Asterix &amp; Obelix: Bash Them All!</em> is a 2D side-scrolling platform game based on the French comic series Ast\u00e9rix. It is a collection of two games. One old, namely a port of the SNES game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=SNSP-AXOP-NOE\">Asterix and Obelix</a>. The other game is called <em>Asterix &amp; Cleopatra</em>, based on the comic and animated movie of the same name. </p>\n<p>In <em>Asterix and Cleopatra</em>, Asterix has to help a Egyptian architect Artifis to build his pyramid for Cleopatra. You play typical platform levels where you jump around obstacles and walk towards the right of the screen. Many enemies such as fake building contractors and Roman soldiers (sent by a jealous Caesar), and pirates have to be bashed into the sky. Each level is concluded with a mini-game. The game closely follows the events of the comic.</p>",

The goal is to destroy all invading aliens before they can capture the humans sitting on the ground. Besides updated graphics with various backgrounds and sprites for the enemies and humans, there are other differences as well: players can select from different ships, all with slightly different weapons and ratings for shields and speed. The XGP mode offers six different levels to complete. It can also be played by two players over the System Link.</p>\n<p>The cartridge also includes \"Classic\" mode, which is a port of the original arcade game. Finally, \"XG\" mode is the same gameplay-wise as Classic, but has been updated with graphics similar to the XGP mode.</p>",

Also, whereas the Japanese version featured characters that were geared towards anime and had larger heads, this version's characters are more realistically designed to look like actual people instead. It also features the ability to allow four friends to play against each other using the Game Boy Link Cable.</p>",

The player chooses from eight different lures, spinner, swisher, minnow, rubber jig, worm, frog, crankbait, and spinnerbait, while using a fish finder to locate the best spot for fishing.</p>\n<p>The player must also contend with constant weather changes that will either help or hinder their fishing with three different game modes to choose from. <em>Quick Fish</em> instantly takes the player to a spot with a lure already available to them. <em>Practice</em> lets the players learn the basics of the game with the main mode being <em>Tournament</em> where the player must progress through the lakes, unlocking them as they do, by catching up to five fish that will be kept in the livewell. In the tournament mode, the player must adhere to rules and regulations and complete their fishing within a certain time limit, failure to do so will result in a disqualification.</p>\n<p>There is even a multiplayer mode that allows up to four players to go against each other using the GameBoy Link Cable.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Winx Club</em> is an action adventure game based on the Italian cartoon series of the same name. The story is similar to that of Harry Potter, only this time the main character is a fairy. She gets to go to a fairy school in fairytale world called Magix where she has to find her true self. This game is similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Winx+Club\">Windows and Playstation 2</a> versions, except that instead of a 3D third person perspective it features a 2D top-down perspective of the game world.</p>\n<p>This game loosely retells the story of the first season of the television series.</p>\n<p>There are \"action\" and \"adventure\"levels. In the adventure levels gameplay consists of finding items for specific NPCs and playing various mini-games. In the action levels the player has to jump, climb and fight enemies. The main character, Bloom, has a magic shield and two attacks that improve during the game. She can also cast a number of spells that can aid her in finding the items she needs. During boss battles Bloom changes to her Winx form in which she is more powerful and can fly. During the levels there are various items to be picked up which improve Blooms health or attacks or unlock new outfits that can be worn.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>A Sound of Thunder</em> is an overhead shoot-em-up based on the 2005 film, which in turn was loosely based on the classic short story by Ray Bradbury. It is Chicago, 2055, and you are Travis Ryer, scientist and employee at Time Safari Incorporated (TSI), a business dedicated to taking wealthy clients back in time 65 million years and giving them the chance to do the impossible: hunt a dinosaur.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are dangers: the tiniest change can screw the future up in ways you can't possibly imagine. Somehow, one of the recent clients has managed to accidentally take a butterfly back through time with him. Soon, the present is rocked by time waves, waves which gradually change the future into how the butterfly-less past would have been. Dinosaurs have been popping up around the city, buildings are crumbling and decaying, and the last wave that hits may mean the end of the human race unless Ryer can return the butterfly to the past.</p>\n<p>With a nice arsenal of weapons at your disposal, such as grenade launchers, machine guns, stun prods, and time freezing bombs that will freeze all enemies for a short amount of time, plus vehicles such as an ordinary car or a tricked-out ATV, you may just get the necessary edge. You can also battle it out in four-player deathmatch mode or a two-player cooperative mode. You may want to hurry, though: you're racing against time... and time is NOT on your side.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Arthur and the Invisibles</em> is an officially licensed game for the French film of the same name (Arthur et les Minimoys in French). Players assume the role of 10 year old Arthur. His grandmother is about to lose her house and Arthur wants to stop this. Instead of the conventional channels Arthur travels to the land of the Minimoys; minuscule creatures just a tenth of an inch tall. Here he searches for his grandfather's treasure together with princess Selenia. This treasure should save the house. But to find it they'll have to travel to the forbidden city ruled by the evil M. the Malicious.</p>\n<p>The Minimoy world consists of the house and its garden, but in an up-scaled size, since the characters are very small. Unlike the PC and console version, which is in 3D, the Game Boy Advance version uses a sidescrolling perspective. The player gets to play as both Arthur, Selenia and her little brother Betamesh. Each character has its own abilities. Arthur is more acrobatic, Selenia has a knife with which she can cut through foliage and Betamesh is smaller and can use this advantage to creep through smaller areas. The story in the game closely follows the script of the film.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In a twist for the series, <em>Beyblade VForce: Ultimate Blader Jam</em> is not based on spinning top battles. Instead, the game bears a closer resemblance to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Marble+Madness\">Marble Madness</a>. In each level, you'll need to get your top to the exit, negotiating narrow paths, and watching out for enemies. There are collectibles in each level, called Bit Beasts, and each level has a par time to beat. Of course, you're controlling a top, not a marble, and so you have a spin gauge. The lower this gauge gets, the harder your top will be to control, and the closer you are to losing. The story features a group of mysterious strangers who are systematically beating the world Beyblade champions.</p>\n<p>This game also has a multiplayer mode. Battle against a friend in the battle mode, and try to knock your opponent's Beyblade off the level, or just stay spinning longer. There is also a race mode, which challenges you to reach the exit before your opponent.</p>",

It sports an official license for the Roland Garros and US Open tournaments. The game comes with 4 official and 6 fictional players. The Game Boy Advance version of the game is mostly the same as its bigger brother on the PC and PlayStation 2. Differences are mostly of a graphical nature (2D instead of 3D). It does lack one of the game modes however and controls tailored to the handheld console.</p>\n<p>The game features the following game modes: arcade, training, exhibition, career, and multi-player. All modes can be played in both singles and doubles. The arcade mode allows you to unlock new courts, players and gear. In the career mode you can start out small and use the cash prizes to further train your character and buy better gear.</p>\n<p>With a link cable you can play with and against up to four friends.</p>",

Herod Sayle has offered to give every schoolchild in the country a free \"Stormbreaker\" computer, but the government doesn't trust him. They trust him even less after Ian is gunned down. That's when Ian's fourteen-year-old nephew Alex comes in. Trained by Ian for years, Alex is recruited by MI6 to investigate Sayle. Alex is tasked with infiltrating Sayle's mansion and finding out just what is going on. Based on the book and movie of the same name.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is equal parts stealth and action. Some enemies are better off avoided, while others you'll want to take out. Collect keycards, use spy gadgets, and be careful. After each level, you'll gain new combat techniques or spy gadgets.</p>",

Throughout each level are fireflies, scattered to lead you in the right direction. For every 50 George collects, he earns an extra life. Due to his inquisitive nature, George likes to touch objects. By pressing \"R\", George will interact with any nearby object with an exclamation mark next to it - and usually cause it to break.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Turbo Turtle Adventure</em> is a puzzle adventure game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Marble+Madness\">Marble Madness</a> where the player guides a rolling turtle through different platform like mazes. Played from a top down perspective, the player has to control his turtle throughout the levels without falling over the edge. There's seven different levels in total and includes a jungle, volcano and a space station. </p>\n<p>There's a number of power ups or items available that are necessary to complete a challenge. First of all the player ha to fins keys to unlock doors. These come in different colors that have to match. Some tiles have arrows on them which force the player in the direction they face. To overcome this the player can use his turbo speed. Some of the ground is weak and can collapse when rolling over it. Often the player will come across gaps. For this there's a build item and a jump item. There's also gravity and wind which drag or push the the player. The turtle's shell can be upgraded in three ways. There's a glide shell which allows the player to go faster over slow ground, the panzer shell which allows the player to pass through force fields and the spike shell which allows the player to get a better grip on slippery ground such as ice.</p>",

It's a one-on-one fighting game where the player takes control of a robot inside a boxing ring and battles against other robots. Each robot has a special move that can be used after filling up a special bar. By combining different button presses the player can unleash a robotic rampage for extra damage against the enemy. It's also possible to do charged punches by holding down the attack button. Once one of the robots has lost all of its health, a concussion mini game is started. Here the player can perform a finishing move by alternately tapping the L and R buttons. </p>\n<p>Three game modes exists. The classic mode where the player can choose to play as either the Red Rocker or the Blue Bomber is a one-off game. In the versus mode it's possible to choose from some additional robots as well as some different arenas. In the title fight mode, the player starts out with the Red Rocker and then has to unlock the other by winning the fights against them.</p>",

The game is played from an isometric perspective and lets the player race around with 19 different classic Hot Wheels cars including Phantasm, Bullygoat and Firestorm. The action takes place on four tracks each with its own theme. These are city, ice, volcano and jungle. Each track has its own obstacles that the player has to watch out for. In the city there is manholes and old ladies, while on the ice track the player has to avoid snowmen and polar bears. In addition to just racing around, the player can also use Nitro and slow motion features. </p>\n<p>Four game modes are available: The quick play mode brings the player straight into the action. The player chooses location car and mode and then then the track is randomly selected. Second, challenges come in five different variants: In VS the player competes against AI controlled cars and has to come first. In Collector the player has to collect items before time runs out. In Pursuit the player has to catch up with a criminal car before time runs out. In Eliminator the last placed player gets eliminated. In Beat the Clock the player races against the clock. </p>\n<p>The third game mode is the ultimate challenge where the player can win the All Out trophy. Here the player will have to complete multiple challenges in turn to unlock the next one.</p>",

There are four different tracks in the game, each with its own layout and appearance, although the difference between them is very small.</p>",

It's an arcade racer similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Micro+Machines\">Micro Machines</a> where the player competes against three other racers on a number of different tracks. To his help, the player has a temporary turbo which he can refill by driving over special items that he finds on the race tracks. Weapons exist too; rockets and mines can be used by the player to stop the competition from winning. </p>\n<p>The game's career mode allows the player to compete and progress in four different race series. Each of these has unique vehicles and courses. While racing the player can earn money which can be used to upgrade the car's tires and engine as well as buy more armor, rockets and mines. There's also a gambling option. The player can bet by guessing on different outcomes from the races, such as the right finishing order. </p>\n<p>The game also has a multiplayer mode for up to four players.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This platformer is based on the hit 2003 movie starring Will Ferrell who played a boy who was raised by elves in the North Pole and became a large elf comparatively. At 30 years of age, Buddy goes on a journey to New York to find his real father and a place where he can fit in.  The game's release was timed to come out the following 2004 holiday season with the dvd release and contains the choice of 5 languages.  </p>\n<p>The main game is a side-scroller where you guide Buddy as he makes his way across icebergs while avoiding chasms and polar bears, dodges Manhattan traffic, and more. There are 10 missions based on the movie's events as he journeys to also help Santa and save Christmas.  You must collect missing sleigh parts, letters (to spell \"New York\" in one level) or parcels.  You will be penalized falling into the icy water or getting hit by a car which drains your health. To restore it, you   jump for lollipops and candies, Buddy's favorite foods. There are also 3 mini-games available from the start menu: Snowman Building is like Sokoban, Santa Says is a memorization game, and Cobbler's Workshop has you matching elves' shoes to put them in boxes. Plus, more minigames are available within the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>NHL 2002</em> is the only entry in Electronic Arts' hockey series to be released on the Game Boy Advance. With the console versions having migrated to 3D graphics years earlier, the handheld game retains a 2D top-down view very similar to the earliest titles in the series on the Genesis and SNES. In particular, the GBA title is based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/142059/nhl-96/\">NHL 96 for SNES</a>, with modes, graphics and even menus recreated almost exactly.</p>\n<p>Besides a standard mode for exhibition games, the game has a practice mode where the number of players on the field can be freely chosen. Season mode is unusual in that, unlike in other games, the player doesn't select a team to lead through a season. Instead, the game includes the full game schedule of the 2001-2002 NHL season, and any team in any scheduled game can be played. If no games of interest are scheduled on a given day, it can be skipped and the results simulated. The season mode also includes the ability to trade players, sign free agents and even to create players.</p>\n<p>The game also includes a multi player mode over the link cable, with up to four players able to join for cooperative or competitive play.</p>",

An aspect integral to the Monsters series from the start is the breeding or merging of monsters to create stronger offspring inheriting the parents' skill sets.</p>\n<p>Only released in Japan, <em>Dragon Quest Monsters: Caravan Heart</em> puts players once again in the role of prince Kiefer from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5640/dragon-warrior-vii/\">Dragon Quest / Dragon Warrior VII</a>. Like previous <em>Dragon Quest Monsters</em> games for the GameBoy Color whose plot took place before <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9104/dragon-quest-vi-maboroshi-no-daichi/\">Dragon Quest VI</a>, <em>Caravan Heart</em> is set before the events of the main series' part from which it was spun off.</p>\n<p>Hiding from the consequences of one of his infamous pranks again, young Kiefer is whisked away by the goddess Rubiss, known from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8075/dragon-warrior-ii/\">Dragon Quest II</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dragon+Warrior+III\">III</a>, to the land of Alefgard. There he meets the boy Lewin whose parents have fallen ill. To cure them with the 'Ball of Roto' artefact and secure his passage home, Kiefer takes the lead of a monster caravan travelling through the country.</p>\n<p>The monster caravan, made up of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/436/dragon-warrior-dragon-quest-series/\">Dragon Quest series'</a> iconic covered wagons, acts as players' mobile base from which they plan their monster hunts. Travelling with it consumes food rations, one of the game's resources.\nUnlike in the first Dragon Quest games, Kiefer can recruit monsters as well as human protagonists into his party which can take on various jobs. The monster breeding from previous titles was replaced by merging monsters, requiring the game's other resource, monster hearts.</p>",

It's pretty simple to figure out, since it's just normal chess.</p>\n<p><strong>Versus Mode</strong>  </p>\n<p>Versus Mode is a two-player mode which can be played with one GBA, where both players alternate control of the console or it can be played with \ntwo GBAs using the Link Cable. Players can choose their character and play chess.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick Play</strong>  </p>\n<p>This plays just like tournament mode except players only face one person. Players choose their own character and play a single game of chess against the computer.</p>\n<p><strong>Puzzle mode</strong>  </p>\n<p>The most complex game mode. The player has to clear the chess board by using his or her wits and different combinations of moves. This is the main part of the game. There are many different levels where the player has to find the correct solution.</p>",

Unfortunately the Bogeyman steals the soles of their friends and turns them into stone - of course the two heroes have to get them back. So they visit the Land of Dead and have to survive a cemetery, a haunted house and the lab of a mad scientist (overall 15 stages).</p>\n<p>The player can switch instantly (but limited because it costs crystals which can be found in the levels) between the two characters which is often needed to progress in the game: both have distinct advantages and disadvantages. Alicia is disguised as a witch, is strong with the ice element, can attack from a range and doesn't take damage from long falls. Greg on the other hand is the master of fire, is disguised as imp and has a super jump. Both have also a special attack which also cost crystals to perform. The gameplay is the usual platforming along with fighting enemies.</p>\n<p>The main difference to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/47813/spirits-spells/\">console version</a> is that the whole game is in 2D with different level design and less puzzle elements.</p>",

Several game modes are included. Wild Race is a basic race, just you versus several computer bikers in a race to the finish line. Use your fists or items you find along the way to knock opponents off their bike and into the hands of law enforcement. Cop Patrol puts you into the shoes of Marshall Lee, to take down those no-good motorcycling thugs. Time Attack is pure racing; just you, the road, and a ticking clock. Survival mode doesn't allow you to restart a race if you lose, so you'll need to complete all races on the first try. Finally, a 2-player mode is included.</p>\n<p>Three different characters are included, each with distinct strengths and a special weapon. Between races, you can upgrade your chosen character. Saving is possible through passwords, and both your current upgrades and unlocked tracks will be remembered.</p>",

There are no options available, like changing the number of balls for example.</p>\n<p>Apart from using Waalkes' characters, some of the sound effects are samples from Waalkes' shows and in the menus, the game plays audio extracts from old shows instead of music.</p>",

There are powerups scattered around the track, which can make Herbie go faster, jump, and shoot a tire. Herbie likes to win, so if he's doing well, he'll go faster, but if he just got hit or is last place, he'll be sad and drive slower. His current mood is noted on the screen.</p>",

You control Kao the Kangaroo through twenty-seven levels. You basic modes of travel are running or jumping but in later levels, you will have snowboarding, flying and jet skiing. As you travel along, enemies try to stop you. You must kill or avoid these enemies. Your main weapon is a pair of boxing gloves with which you can pound enemies but, if you push down and attack, you can also do a tail spin to attack lower-height enemies. In each level, there are flags you can pick up and, by pressing select, you can drop them to create your own continue point.</p>",

They have received a strange letter from an anonymous sender, and are about to discuss it during their meeting in a park, when they suddenly become unconscious... When the two wake up, they find themselves in a strange world, populated by characters from various works by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/355934/go-nagai/\"> Go Nagai</a>. At first, they meet Akira from <em>Devilman</em> and Cutey Honey from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=cutey+honey\"> eponymous manga</a>. At that point, the player can choose to follow either of them as the main protagonist; the best friend will then leave with the other character. The two stories have the same main events, and eventually lead to a grand confrontation that will decide the fate of that world.</p>\n<p><em>Legend of Dynamic: G\u014dsh\u014dden - H\u014dkai no Rondo</em> is a Japanese-style RPG, with wandering on the world map, party management, turn-based battles, simple leveling-up, and other typical features of the genre. The characters the player meets in the game are heroes featured in Go Nagai's stories, including <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=mazin\"> Mazinger Z</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=susano%C5%8D+desentsu\"> Susa no Oh</a>. The game features a so-called \"Assort System\", which allows the player to team up characters and create combinations within the party. Active party members which participate in combat directly are called \"Battlers\"; their abilities can be enhanced in various ways by assigning \"partners\" to them, which play a more passive, supportive role, and can not take part in battles.</p>",

Each level represents one of Garfield's lives (though this implies Garfield has lived an entire life in the sewer and another in a tree...).

        "description": "<p><em>X-Men: The Official Game</em> is based on the third <em>X-Men</em> film. The game lets you control either Wolverine, Colossus, Iceman or Nightcrawler through twenty-five stages of a traditional side-scrolling beat-'em up. You move through the levels usually to find the exit. The stages can scroll from left to right, top to bottom or are designed more like a labyrinth. Enemies are getting rid off using a variety of punches. The characters differ hereby in range and the damage they deal. Every character also has his own special attack and some abilities on his own. For example, Colossus can smash certain materials while Wolverine regenerates his health over the time.</p>\n<p>While you start off the game as Wolverine, you are later joined by the other characters and may switch between them any time. Every X-Man also has his own power bar, which is filled up by collecting blue symbols, which can be used up to increase the amount of damage you deal for a period of time.</p>",

Sharing the storyline (Bond must stop megalomaniacal industrialist Raphael Drake from achieving world domination) and general gameplay concept (first-person shooter), this version adapts a selection of levels from the other versions for the handheld's capabilities.</p>\n<p>The player must navigate 007 through nine objective-based levels, mixing action and stealth in exotic locales like an Austrian castle, corporate towers in Tokyo and a South Pacific island. To defeat the enemy goons, a variety of guns including pistols, automatics, and a sniper rifle, are available. In some missions, heavier hardware like rocket and grenade launchers as well as explosive charges must be found to overcome special adversaries. Of course, no Bond game would be complete without a few of Q's gadgets like a wristwatch laser or a cellphone grapple, usually to be used when Bond's spy qualities are called upon.</p>\n<p>The game is powered by a 3D engine that is fully polygonal (with the exception of sprite-based enemies) and features digitized speech.</p>",

After the battle, people built a shrine to protect the Four Sword.</p>\n<p>Several years later, princess Zelda noticed that Vaati might have escaped from the blade of the Four Sword. She asked Link to come to the Four Sword shrine to check with her. As soon as they came there, Vaati captured Zelda and carried her away.</p>\n<p>Some little fairies later told Link that princess Zelda was at Vaati's palace up on the sky. In an attempt to recuse Zelda, Link dragged the Four Sword and it created three more Links! The Links then began their adventure to save Zelda...</p>\n<p><em>Four Swords</em> requires from two to four players. There are five levels (a training level, three main levels and Vaati palace-an unlockable level). During the game, players must collect as many Ruppees as possible while solving puzzles and defeating enemies. When enough Ruppees are collected, the Great Fairy will give the players a key to open the unlockable level. At the end of each level, the one who collects the most Ruppees will be the winner.</p>\n<p>When any of the players dies, the number of Ruppees collected will decrease. The more times a Link dies, the more Ruppees are lost. The game is over when there are not enough Ruppees to revive any Link.</p>",

It retains the action RPG gameplay system of the console version; however, in this release, the player character is unable to jump.</p>\n<p>The player is only allowed to control a human character in this version (as opposed to the pre-made human, elf, and dwarf characters of the console release). The player can still choose to assign the human hero to one of the three available classes: warrior, archer, and wizard.</p>\n<p>Other differences include the addition of a few side quests, and an enhanced level of interactivity in the city of Baldur's Gate (the characters are able to enter more houses, talk to town inhabitants, break barrels with equipped weapons, etc.).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Tom and Jerry in Infurnal Escape</em> is a cartoon game with a rather complicated plot: In an attempt to catch Jerry, Tom pulls the carpet which Jerry is standing on. But instead of Jerry, a piano comes down and crushes Tom. Tom is sent to hell, where a big red dog puts him in a cauldron to cook him. Fortunately, a fairy-cat appears and offers to help Tom escape provided that he has to go back to the living world and collect as many golden bones as possible. That's where the game begins, with hidden golden bones, funny looking but tough enemies, and the annoying little devil Jerry who tries to make Tom's life miserable or aids the enemies.</p>\n<p>Players control Tom, in order to collect golden bones and get to the goal while fighting against enemies on the way. Tom can also collect helpful items such as bat (boots hitting power), cheese (distracts Jerry), and Tom's head (Adds one life). There are a total of 15 levels. Players must go through all of them to reach the final boss: the devil dog. When Tom has no more lives, he is sent back to hell, where he has to get his 3 lives back (with 2 minutes limited) to return to the living world and start the level over again.</p>\n<p>The graphics are 2D. The game has no saving function. Players have to remember the passwords to choose their level.</p>",

The puzzle element of the game come in the use of a combination of their skills such as Giselle's ability to jump, float, pick up objects, and hang from ledges and Pip's abilities to push objects, climb walls, enter small passage ways, and distract the enemies. Working together they are able to knock their foes unconscious and, with Giselle's singing, free the woodland creatures trapped within them. Some woodland creatures are trapped in cages and once freed will aid Giselle with their various skills such as birds helping her float across small gaps and to slow her descent during a long fall.</p>",

Now rather lost, they must puzzle their way through seven large levels to escape.</p>\n<p><em>The Berenstain Bears and the Spooky Old Tree</em> is a puzzle platform game based on the book with same name. Each of the three bears have different abilities and attacks, and all three will need to work together to reach the exit in each level. Brother Bear can push boxes, and has a slingshot that shoots straight ahead. Sister Bear can jump extra far, and has a stick. Cousin Fred can use a rope to reach high areas, and can throw pinecones in an arc. When they're attacked by enemies, they lose courage. After three attacks, they need to retry the level. Candy and honey pots are scattered around the level, and will give the Bears another chance at the level.</p>\n<p>The game was packaged with a Berenstain Bears story, called <em>Trick or Treat</em>.</p>",

In the story mode, each level has 3 runs, each one unlocking more of the level. Characters are scattered around the level, and will give missions, for example making a difficult jump, or collecting items within a time limit. There are also time challenge (most points inside a time limit), trick challenge (match tricks), and turbo challenge (match kinds of tricks fast) modes for each level, along with a tutorial and versus mode. In versus mode, two players take turns (hot-seat) getting the best trick possible.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2</em>, the first game in the series on the Game Boy Advance, is an extreme sports game following the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tony+Hawk's+Pro+Skater\">Tony Hawk</a> template.</p>\n<p>The game features 12 professional BMX riders to choose from, each with their own statistics in speed, spin, balance, bunnyhop, air, and hangtime. Five different selectable bikes augment these stats further.</p>\n<p>The game's main mode is called \"Proquest\". In each level, a variety of goals and challenges must be met within a time limit, netting experience points. These points can be used to increase the rider's stats and they unlock further levels. Challenges include reaching certain high scores, collecting letters and spray cans, and performing specific tricks. Completing the first levels switches the game to Pro, and later, Hardcore mode, increasing the difficulty of the goals in each stage. </p>\n<p>All of the six levels (shown in isometric perspective) are filled with half and quarter pipes, ramps, bowls, rails and special objects (a truck, a fountain, a row of boxes) to perform tricks on. Tricks are activated through button combinations. Completing several tricks in a row without bailing increases the rush meter - when filled, it allows the performance of signature moves for each rider.</p>\n<p>Two further modes are \"Session\" and \"Freeride\" - they allow practicing unlocked levels either with or without the time limit.</p>\n<p>Two two-player modes utilizing a single GBA (the players take turns) are also available: In \"Full Run\", the two players compete for a high score, in \"Star Collector\" they compete for a best time in finding 10 stars scattered over the levels.</p>",

Game modes include Exhibition, Tournament and Career. Tournaments are either one-on-one or tag team, with randomly selected brackets. In Career mode, the player can choose a region of the United States to fight in and is then assigned a random match. The goal is to increase audience popularity to 100% by winning matches, which will lead to the chance of a championship fight.</p>\n<p>In the ring, the action is viewed from the side. Punches, grapples, reversals, taunts and special moves are available through button combinations. Successful moves build up an energy meter, which, when full, can be used to perform a unique signature move for each wrestler.</p>\n<p>Not all 40 wrestlers are available from the start - some have to be unlocked by winning the Career mode first.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The 2002 iteration of <em>Madden NFL</em> is the first to be released on the Game Boy Advance. Its style of graphics and gameplay mimics that of the 16-bit entries in the series on the Genesis and SNES: the field is seen from an angled overhead perspective with players as sprites; camera movement is achieved through the GBA's scaling abilities.</p>\n<p>A \"play now\" mode offers quick exhibition games, while \"season play\" offers full seasons or playoffs, with progress stored to battery-backed RAM. Configurable options include quarter length, penalty levels, weather (in exhibition games), two skill levels, and manual or automatic player control on offense or catching passes. Season and playoff modes simulate the complete games schedule - every single one can be either played or the results simulated.</p>\n<p>The game includes the 31 teams of the 2001 NFL season, as well as the 2002 expansion team, the Houston Texans, and the traditional All-Madden team. Commentary is provided by the sampled voices of John Madden and Pat Summerall.</p>",

Team and player stats are updated for the 2003 NFL season, and the game again features commentary by John Madden and Al Michaels. An entirely new feature is connectivity to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10021/madden-nfl-2004/\">GameCube</a> version of the game, which can be used to unlock bonuses in the console title.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Inspired by the Playhouse Disney (later Disney Junior) cartoon of the same name, \"Disney's Little Einsteins\" puts you (or your child, which the game clearly was designed for) in control of the titular characters and their transportation, Rocket.</p>\n<p>The game has 7 missions of 3 sections each, and each mission, like the missions in the actual show, is set to a piece of classical music and features a famous work of art. At the start of each mission, you'll have to give Rocket enough power to blast off by tapping the action button to the beat of the music. After that, there are six ways to play - one section has you in control of Rocket as you steer him through an obstacle course, and another asks you to listen to the music for what you need to find. There are also two difficulties - Easy and Hard - which affect not only the buttons you need to press in certain situations, but also require you to do a little extra work to fulfill your objective.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Like earlier entries in the Tony Hawk skateboarding series on the Game Boy Advance, <em>Tony Hawk's Underground</em> adapts the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10893/tony-hawks-underground/\">console title</a> to the handheld platform using isometric graphics and polygonal characters.</p>\n<p>The main game mode is story mode. Players create their own skater who in the beginning only knows a few basic tricks. By performing moves successfully, the skater's stats and number of known tricks will increase. The campaign consists of 10 large levels. Friendly characters standing around the neighborhood can be talked to and give tasks that usually have to be completed within a time limit: these include performing specific tricks or combos, finding certain items or reaching high scores. Completing goals adds cash to the character's wallet, makes more areas of the level available to skate in, and unlocks levels and pro skaters. Crashing deducts from the characters health' bar. When it reaches zero, the skater is moved to the beginning of the level. Wearing protective gear (helmets and knee pads) reduces the impact of crashes, and eating food items replenishes the health meter. Both are available in the skate shop in exchange for cash.</p>\n<p>Further modes include arcade mode, which hearkens back to the classic Tony Hawk games: after picking a pro skater, a two-minute-run of a level begins, in which a number of goals must be completed. While arcade and story modes use the same levels, the goals are completely different. The free skate mode allows practicing unlocked levels without a time limit. Multiplayer modes include two hot-seat games: a HORSE contest and a high score competition. Available only via the link cable is the cart racing mode, where players race each other in shopping carts \u00e0 la <em>Jackass</em>.</p>\n<p>Gameplay and controls remain the same from previous entries in the series. An entirely new option allows the skater to step off the board and run around on foot: thus a quick 'run-out' is a new trick to increase the combo multiplier.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In this portable installment of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Activision's\">Activision's</a> long standing <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Cabela's+Big+Game+Hunter\">hunting simulation series</a> players start a game by customizing a character, selecting age, hair, and snazzy hunting couture, as well as hunting skills, such as aiming, accuracy, strength, and stealth. Then they set out on an hunting adventure, with a view to pot a grizzly bear or wildest moose. Two modes are available a \"Quick Hunt\" and a \"Career Hunt\". Fear not, the later is hardly social commentary, rather it is a goal oriented story mode, while the former will allow the player to select one of the various breath taking North American hunting and persecute the local fauna to their heart's content. The story mode revolves around allowing the player's grizzled uncle \"Pete\" live vicariously through the them by accomplishing Pete's dream of entering the Hunter's Hall of Fame. Hunters wishing to achieve such fame must slay one animal in each of the 65 hunting regions in the country. Poor Pete was three kills shy of bloodsport immortalization, then he broke his leg... The player must accomplish the entire task, for Pete's sake.</p>\n<p>Gameplay consists of selecting a region to go hunting in and then wandering about looking for the correct animal in your bestiary to knock off. In Alaska for instance the player may be tasked with gunning down a moose. During the aimless wandering and Promethean loneliness sections of the game the player will have time to select the proper guns and ammo for their quarry as well as apply various lures and fatally seductive moose (etc.) mating cries. When the animal sought is kind enough to appear, at the end of a long trail of tracks, the player may whip out their rifle going into a first person, crosshair-grafted-directly-to-the-eye style, mode. When the player is content with a corpse it will be weighed and the level will end, until they choose to return to try and bag a heftier score. </p>\n<p>Being sentimental the game provides the player with trophies of their kills in the form of taxidermied animal heads for which a rustic and picturesque log cabin has graciously been provided.</p>",

He has scattered five golden runes and handed each one to a different character in the Puyoverse. Our hero Arle isn't aware of this - until her pet Carbuncle runs for the runes! Now Arle must find the five runes and recover her friend - all at the same time.</p>\n<p>As with many other titles in the Puyo Puyo series, <em>Puyo Pop</em> pits you as Arle Nadja against a series of crazy characters bent on stopping her from recovering the five runes. As before, gameplay is simple - match Puyos (which come in up to five colors), make chains, and drown your opponents in a flood of Nuisance Puyos. In certain stages, you might run into Point Puyos, which when popped will add a bonus to the current chain, and Hard Puyos, which require two hits to pop. In addition, once Arle is finished with her quest, she can search for items which can unlock new things for her to explore.</p>\n<p>The traditional battle mode is still around, of course, as up to four players can compete for Puyo bragging rights.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Game Boy Advance version of <em>Finding Nemo</em> adapts the Pixar film as a side-scrolling action game with light puzzle and exploration elements.</p>\n<p>The game's 12 levels follow the plot of the film. Depending on the level, the player either controls clownfish Marlin or his son Nemo. Goals in the levels might include simply finding the exit, finding certain characters or items, reaching a certain point within a time limit, or simple survival, like when Marlin and his friend Dory are chased by Bruce the shark.</p>\n<p>The levels are full of unfriendly sea creatures that shouldn't be touched and environmental hazards like strong currents. Simple puzzle solutions are used to get around some obstacles, like dropping a pearl into on oyster for it to close, pushing a piece of rock on a hole to block a current or flipping switches to open barriers.</p>\n<p>Two levels deviate from the norm and are not side-scrollers. The camera is placed behind Marlin instead, who has to chase the character before him, taking care not to deviate from the path laid out by bubble rings.</p>\n<p>Between levels, players can play a simple game of Concentration/Memory to unlock pictures in the game's gallery. Swimming through bubble rings during the levels gives additional chances in the mini-game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Fila Decathlon</em> is a sports game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Track+%26+Field\">Track &amp; Field</a> where the player gets to compete in all ten events of decathlon (100 metres, long jump, shot put, 400 metres, 110 metres hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin throw and 1500 metres). Like previous games in the genre, the gameplay involves large amounts of button mashing, but with added complexity.</p>\n<p>In all events running is done by alternatively pressing the a and b buttons. In the running events, rising at the start and dipping at the end is done with the d-pad. In 1500 meters the d-pad is used to chance lane and to a fast rush. In the jumping events the d-pad is used to do the jump. To make a good jump the player first has to press down and then quickly up. The shorter the time this is done in, the higher or longer the jump will be. In these events the player also has to pick an optimal starting position. In discus throw and shot put the player has to press b quickly to gain horizontal speed and then a to gain vertical speed. Pressing a too long will lead to an over step. In javelin throw the player has to press left to draw the javelin back, then press down to minimize speed loss, and finally press right twice to make the throw. </p>\n<p>There are three game modes: championship, practice and multiplayer. In the championship the player plays all the events in the right order, while in practice the player is taught how to play them.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Released as the handheld companion to the 3D <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/11487/bionicle/\">BIONICLE</a>, this game obviously has different gameplay, such as the lack of a save feature, using passwords instead, and a limited number of lives, after which the game resets. An improvement is that all versions of the Toa, including Toa, Toa Nuva, and Takanuva, are playable. Some basic story elements are kept the same, however.</p>\n<p>A set number of Matoran have to be rescued in a level so that they can help the Turaga construct a key to the boss room. Players use their Elemental powers to fight enemies, but their powers are limited. Once their meter runs out, they have to find a power-up. Rescued Matoran are taken back to a shrine near the beginning of the stage. Platforming is also involved, as moving platforms, falling platforms, cliffs, and jumping are included.</p>",

All they want to do is take a breather, but Harmony, the girls' number one fan, won't let them. When Ami and Yumi refuse to cater to Harmony's whim, the crazed blonde takes matters into her own hands - by stealing their diminutive manager Kaz and their instruments! Now Ami and Yumi must use their wits - and what's left of their music - to recover their instruments, find Harmony and rescue Kaz. Without any of them, Puffy AmiYumi may be doomed!</p>\n<p><em>Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi: Kaznapped</em> is a single-player platformer based on the Cartoon Network series \"Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi\". Controlling and using Ami and Yumi's unique abilities (Ami can sing and swing, while Yumi plays guitar and lifts heavy objects), the player battles through six worlds of three areas each (with another world revealed when the game is complete). Along their way Ami and Yumi will encounter a series of puzzles which only a certain skill can solve, Kaz-bots created by Harmony, and other Puffy fans who just want a piece of the girls. Kaz-bots can be attacked, but fans can only be temporarily distracted (if they get attacked, the girls will lose points). Thankfully, Ami and Yumi can gain an advantage by petting their cats Jang Keng (to regain lost health) or Tekirai (for an extra life).</p>\n<p>As Ami and Yumi progress in their adventure, they can also unlock mini-games, costumes, and other goodies for the player to enjoy.</p>",

The game takes the simulation approach, with the player being able to adjust suspension, gearbox, steering, tyres and more to fit driving style and road conditions. Damage acquired during a race must be repaired between stages at the expense of time. Besides driving the full championship, it is also possible to practice single rallies and even single stages - a time trial mode for single stages is also available. Tracks not available to be selected from the beginning must be unlocked by winning the championship first.</p>\n<p>Besides rally mode, the game also offers arcade mode, which features six tracks for conventional circuit racing. The circuits can be driven as time trials, single races or a championship. This mode also supports multiplayer via the link cable, only requiring a single cartridge.</p>\n<p>During racing, the track is displayed via a Mode-7-style scaling/rotating bitmap engine, with the cars rendered as texture-mapped polygons. During rally races, the game features a co-driver calling out road features ahead via digitized speech, which is provided by Colin McRae's actual co-driver Nicky Grist.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Need for Speed Underground</em> for the Game Boy Advance takes the street racing concept of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/11175/need-for-speed-underground/\">console/PC title</a> and adapts it for the capabilities of the handheld platform.</p>\n<p>The game's main mode is Underground Mode, in which the player's goal is to make it to the top of the street racing scene from humble beginnings. Starting with 10.000 credits and a choice of 3 cars, races must be won to win money and unlock further cars and upgrade parts to make them available for purchase. In each night of racing, the player must challenge one of the other racers that is slightly above them in the rankings. The race track and parameters are then randomly chosen and winning the race advances the player's ranking. Once other racers are behind in ranking, they can also challenge the player. In that case, the player gets to choose track, number of laps and number of opponents. The game begins in the preliminary rankings, in which there are only standard circuit races. Once the number one position has been reached, the championship rankings open up and there is a different ladder for each of the four racing types: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Circuit (six tracks): The goal is to complete a set number of laps before the opponents. There will be passing traffic at intersections which must be avoided.</li>\n<li>Sprint (six tracks): Shorter than circuit races, the goal is to reach a set point on the track the fastest. </li>\n<li>Drag (four tracks): The very short tracks are completely straight, but manual transmission is mandatory, requiring precise shifting to avoid engine burnout or losing speed.</li>\n<li>Drift (eight tracks): Points are awarded for stylishly sliding around corners, with care taken not to crash into them. The goal is to beat a score set by the opponent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All modes but sprint also feature reverse variations of the tracks. All in all, more than sixty races must be won to complete Underground Mode.</p>\n<p>Between races, cars can be traded and upgraded. 14 different cars are available, and there are a large variety of functional (engines, turbos, transmission, tires, brakes) and visual (bumpers, hoods, rims, paint jobs, vinyls) upgrades. Unlike in the console version, visual upgrades are only cosmetic since there is no reputation system.</p>\n<p>Quick Race mode can be utilized for quick challenges using cars and tracks unlocked via Underground mode. The game also features a multiplayer mode via the link cable.</p>\n<p>The game engine is fully polygonal and represents cars and tracks as texture-mapped polygons.</p>",

The goal in each level is simply to reach the exit. The player controls only one of the two friends at a time, but can switch between them at will. Each of the two has different abilities: Asterix can double jump and carry torches, while Obelix has a more powerful punch and can move giant stone cubes. Hindering the duo on their way are legions of Roman soldiers as well as other enemies like barbarians, who come in different shapes and sizes, most of which can be punched out rather easily. They leave behind their helmets, which should be collected as they function as a sort of currency. The helmets can also be found lying about in the levels, along with other power-ups like hams (which restore health) or magic potions (which make the heroes temporarily invincible and stronger). Some light puzzle elements come into play when switches have to be pressed to active certain mechanisms like rising platforms or open doors that will allow the player to advance.</p>\n<p>The collected helmets come into play when the peddler appears in a level. At his store, helmets can be spent for health power-ups as well as unlocking bonus combo moves.</p>\n<p>Some of the levels deviate from the norm: in the so-called \"Ob-Sleigh\" stages, Obelix will slide down a river or mountainside, with Asterix riding on his back. In these, any bonus items are to be found in the middle of the track. Slowing down helps in trying to collect all of them, but high speed is required for some jumps that have to be made.</p>\n<p>Picking up golden laurels and Roman helmets in the levels will unlock an Ob-Sleigh bonus mini-game, featuring both the stages from the main mode as well as some new ones.</p>",

While running there will be many platformer obstacles like needing to to interact with levers to move to following areas. The main villain in story is Sin Tzu, but Batman meets other villains from the universe, such as the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>Using a Gamecube to Game Boy Advance link cable unlockables can be obtained in both the console and handheld versions of this game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Action Man: Robot Atak</em> is based on the direct-to-DVD animated film of the same name, in turn based on the line of toys. To stop the evil Dr. X and his army of robots that have been attacking cities across the globe, Action Force seek out his secret hideout, Island X. Dropped on different parts of the island, Action Man, Redwolf and Flint must first find each other, and then put an end to the evil doctor's plans.</p>\n<p>Most of the game's 17 levels take the form of a side-scrolling platformer with a heavy action focus. To get to the level exit, the controlled character must jump pits and gaps, climb ledges and take out many enemies, different varieties of X' robots and various animals native to the island: spiders, bats, even dinosaurs. Each character has slightly different abilities (until the finale, which hero is controlled depends on the level): Native American Redwolf always carries his bow, while Action Man and Flint start most levels with only their fists. They can pick up weapons, though, including throwing discs (for Action Man only), several different guns (which can be further enhanced by timed power-ups) and a boomerang (for Australian Flint only). Only Flint can double jump. Picking up 50 Action Man icons gives an extra life. Regular extra lives and health power-ups are also available, and a reset checkpoint is available every few screens.</p>\n<p>Variety from the platform levels comes in two levels where Flint uses his dirt rider and Redwolf surfs the waves. These are seen from behind the heroes as they must avoid or blast away obstacles and collect Action Man icons. Action Man lives up to his name in a level where he rides a motorcycle up a volcano (shooting missiles at enemies and jumping across gaps) and another one where he straps helicopter blades to his back to fly towards the level end.</p>\n<p>Finally, there are several boss battles, including a fight against the spider queen, a fist fight(!) against a T. Rex and the final confrontation with Dr. X.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Looney Tunes: Back in Action</em> on the Game Boy Advance is, like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/14987/looney-tunes-back-in-action/\">its counterpart on consoles</a>, loosely based on the 2003 film. Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck find the office of Mr. Warner at Warner Bros. taken over by bad guys, including Yosemite Sam, Marvin the Martian, Elmer Fudd and the Tazmanian Devil, all working for the evil Acme Corporation. Thankfully, other Looney Tunes characters have formed a resistance against Acme and can guide Bugs and Duffy to defeat Acme's nefarious scheme.</p>\n<p>The game takes place over four large levels: the Wooden Nickel casino in Las Vegas, Area 52 in the Nevada desert, the Louvre in Paris and a temple in the jungle. Levels are displayed in an isometric view and players can switch between Bugs and Daffy at any time. The characters have slightly different abilities: Bugs can jump longer distances by flapping his ears and can get across the level by burrowing through rabbit holes. Daffy is the only one who can swim in water.</p>\n<p>The goal in each level is to capture 12 \"munkeys\". Other characters like Foghorn Leghorn or Egghead Jr. are always nearby to give hints on what to do next. To get to the munkeys, several smaller challenges must be met: solving a maze, racing or dueling other characters or leading enemies into a trap. Enemies like guards, cowboys (in the casino) or robots (at Area 52) always patrol the levels. Mailboxes dispense useful powerups to deal with them: throwing ammunition in the form of eggs, a special one-time-use dropping weapon (an anvil for Daffy, a piano for Bugs), an invincibility shield, and more.</p>\n<p>Also lying about the levels are \"munnies\" (i.e. banknotes). Collecting enough of them opens up mini-games in which bombs drop from the sky and must be pushed off a platform before they explode. Fulfilling the quota of bombs without being blown up by one gains an extra life.</p>\n<p>A boss fight against one of the four main bad guys concludes each level. The transition to the next level comes in the form of a racing game, seen from behind the player's car. The same bad guy just beaten in a fight must be beaten again, this time to the finish line. Winning on speed alone is impossible, powerups lying on the road must be used to slow down the opponent: these include bombs, shields, anvils, magnets, and more.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>B\u014dkyaku no Senritsu</em> is an action-adventure game based on the anime with the same name. While the game was not released outside of Japan, western localization of anime is also known as <em>The Melody of Oblivion</em>. After the opening movie, you get to select on of the three characters to start the game with. The characters available for selection are Bokka (\u30dc\u30c3\u30ab), Toone (\u9060\u97f3), and Coco (\u30b3\u30b3). Each of the characters feature different story lines and clearing them all unlocks a bonus scenario.</p>\n<p>The game consists of stages at the end of which is a boss fight. Adventure part of the game works as a visual-novel and progresses the story. Action parts of the game play in top-down perspective where you walk with your characters through the open world and fight the monsters and creatures along your path. If your HP reaches zero, you will be prompted to continue which will restart the current stage you are on from the beginning. Your basic set of attack is close combat swinging, arrow shooting or special power strikes. You can also pick up items to replenish your health or strength bar.</p>\n<p>Option menu lets you check quite a few bonus materials. You can listen to background music from the stages you have cleared, you can check anime movies, events from the story parts you have passed, and character graphic from the characters you met so far. The game also lets you choose between three difficulty settings: easy, normal, or hard.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Moto Racer Advance</em> is the first adaptation of the motorcycle racing series for a handheld platform. The core concept is similar to the original games: players race on asphalt or all-terrain tracks. The game offers different game modes: single race, championship, league and progression. The latter is the game's main mode as it offers a path for the three main racing styles: Cross, GP and Traffic. By winning races additional locations, bikes and tricks are unlocked. Each of the three paths can be followed separately, they do not need to be completed in a specific order. A fourth style called Ultimate is unlocked later on in the game.</p>\n<p>Bikes have different statistics based on maximum speed, acceleration, brakes and grip. Some of the available locations include California, England, Kenya, Moscow and San Francisco. GP tracks have a set number of laps and an amount of opponents needs to be passed before reaching the finish line. It puts the focus on using brakes effectively to go through corners in a fluent manner. The off-road terrain tracks in the Cross mode are similar in concept, but demands mastery of powersliding to pass corners. They also have bumps and rougher terrain. The traffic style is a mix with both types of terrain, but introduces AI-controlled traffic that needs to be dodged. Signs above the racer show upcoming corners with a different colour based on the sharpness and they also warn for obstacles. While racing a nitro is available to do a wheelie and gain more speed. It can be depleted, but regenerates over time. The top of the screen holds the time and shows a horizontal bar with the positions of all riders.</p>\n<p>Multiplayer games for up to four racers simultaneously are available through a link cable.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Developer HotGen's adaptation of Activision's Tony-Hawk-style <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5362/mat-hoffmans-pro-bmx/\">BMX game</a> for the Game Boy Advance is based on the design of their earlier <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/57027/mat-hoffmans-pro-bmx/\">GBC version</a>, offering mostly the same game modes but in different and larger levels, and adding two-player modes for the first time.</p>\n<p>Players can select from the same eight professional BMX riders as in the console and GBC versions, each with different stats and signature moves. The training section is as comprehensive as on GBC: in 19 levels, basic riding and all manners of tricks, grinds, and combos are taught. The main Career mode consists of six levels. To unlock later levels, magazine covers must be collected, which is done by achieving specific goals in each level, all within a time limit: this includes reaching several different high scores (\"high\", \"pro\", and \"sick\"), collecting the letters T-R-I-C-K, finding secret covers hidden in the levels, and performing specific tricks, combos, or consecutive tricks without any bails in-between. The final level is a competition level where there are no goals to be completed or magazine covers to be won: medals are awarded instead for the best scores.</p>\n<p>The same levels as in Career mode are used in Tournament mode, where players must impress judges to land in the top three for each level. Unlocked levels can be practised without a time limit in Free Ride mode. Time Trial mode features four special dirt track stages and consists of trying to reach the finish line within a very tight time limit: performing tricks extends the limit and is necessary to have any chance of winning.</p>\n<p>Four different two-player modes are included via link cable connection: VS. allows the two players to perform in the same level, trying to outscore each other. Bomb is a game of tag where players try to give each other a bomb before it explodes. In Star Hunt the goal is to collect more stars than the other player, and Tug-O-War features a power indicator that needs to be shifted to the other player's side by performing high-scoring moves.</p>\n<p>Like on the GBC, the game shows the player's biker from a side-scrolling perspective. While still based on horizontal lanes, movement isn't as limited as on GBC - changing the lane through vertical movement is possible at any time when on the ground. Tricks are performed through button combinations when in the air or at certain objects. The GBA's L and R buttons enhance the possible moves from the GBC: Pressing R allows any trick to be turned into a Fakie for more variety. Pressing L locks the biker in the current lane so no accidental vertical movement is made. Performing moves without bailing raises a power bar, that when full, allows the biker's signature moves to be performed for extra score.</p>",

The player can control two different air crafts depending on the mission: a Huey or a WWII-era propeller fighter. Each vehicle has its own mechanics such as the ability to pick-up troopers from the ground for the Huey, and a higher speed for the fighter. As he flies through each of the sixteen missions, the player must destroy enemy tanks, soldiers and helicopters, and protect his own army. The goal is to take over enemy bunkers to gain credits and destroy the enemy base. As the game progresses, other weapons can be acquired.</p>",

You gain points by hitting Pok\u00e9mon with Water gun at very close range, sending them flying. At first, you start only juggling Poliwag and Totodile, but after gaining 3000 points Psyduck jumps in. Psyduck requires two blasts to send flying, while Poliwag falls faster than Totodile. Be careful not to let anyone touch the ground, or the game will end. The cards were part of the McDonald's Original Minimum\u2605Pack, a 30-card pack distributed in McDonald's Happy Meals in Japan from January 26 to February 24, 2002.

Soon, some Swinub join in on the attack. Swinub run even faster than Teddiursa, and are more cautious of the player's moves. The attacks just get faster as time marches on, and if the player allows the other Pok\u00e9mon to stay at the leeks long enough, the patch starts shrinking. When the patch disappears, Farfetch'd is devastated and the player loses. The cards needed to play the game are the Skyridge Piloswine, Farfetch'd, Nidoran\u2640 and Swinub.</p>",

The player picks a group of girls from a previous arcade entry (with the exception of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/65341/super-real-mahjong-pii/\">PII</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/65788/super-real-mahjong-piii/\">PIII</a>, which are grouped together like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Super+Real+Mahjong+PII+%26+PIII\">the home port</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/64540/super-real-mahjong-pi/\">PI</a>, which isn't included because it only included a generic opponent and never received any ports). After the player makes a selection, the computer randomly selects an order for the girls, and the player must face them in this order. After defeating an opponent in mahjong, the player will get a picture as a reward, sometimes risque, but not nude.</p>",

The heads side shows a Chansey, and the tails side is blank. A calculator shows you what percentage of the coins landed on which side. The game can go on infinitely, as it keeps track of every coin until exited, but the coins displayed on screen are cleared after ten flips. The coin is already rotating before it is flipped, so the exact moment the button is pressed may affect which side it lands on. The only card required to play this game is Chansey from the Expedition Base Set.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Gem Smashers</em> is an action puzzle game where the player has to rescue prehistoric creatures captured by a fearsome scientist from outer space. Three creatures, Bau, Bam and Bom have already escaped and the player takes control of these. The game consists of single screen levels that are full of gems in different colours. It's the player's task to destroy these with the use of the little creature that bounces around the screen. The problem is that the creature can only destroy gems of the same colour as itself and therefore it's necessary to hit specific colour changing blocks that may be hidden in a rock that first has to be broken. To make it all a bit trickier there are also death blocks marked by skulls that the player has to avoid hitting. Once all gems have been destroyed an exit opens and the player can move on to the next level. </p>\n<p>The game has a story mode with more than 100 levels, an arcade mode with more than 60 levels and a battle mode for two players via link cable. There are also three special modes that the player can unlock. The story mode consists of a world map where for each section the player can complete the levels in any order. Each section ends with a boss fight. Depending on which of the creatures the player chooses to play as he will start at different sections. The arcade mode has a more linear level structure.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Next to versions on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/22927/ultimate-spider-man/\">consoles</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/68361/ultimate-spider-man/\">Nintendo DS</a>, <em>Ultimate Spider-Man</em> was also adapted for the Game Boy Advance. It follows the same basic story as the other versions (reducing it to its bare necessities and changing many details) and presents it as traditional 2D side-scroller.</p>\n<p>The game is a follow-up to the Venom storyline from the <em>Ultimate Spider-Man</em> comic series. Three months after his apparent death, Venom is back and causing trouble. Spider-Man finds his home neighborhood of Queens besieged by a gang of thugs while a group of mercenaries have set their sights on capturing Venom. The game's storyline is illustrated by comic-style cutscenes, with many of the images re-used from the DS version.</p>\n<p>The game consists of seven parts called \"issues\" of three chapters each. As in the other versions of the game, players will control both Spider-Man and Venom, both of which have different abilities. To take out the many enemies, both have various attack moves at their disposal, which can be strung along into combos. Both can also stick to walls and ceilings and pull themselves up (Spidey using his web, Venom using his tendrils). Spider-Man can additionally use his webbing in various other ways, like immobilizing enemies by throwing a web ball and swinging across obstacles. His web fluid however is limited and must be filled up by collecting appropriate power-ups. Power-ups are also needed to refill his health. Venom on the other hand cannot find power-ups even though his health constantly drains. He instead has to feed on defeated enemies to restore his health. Some levels feature permanent power-ups: increasing Spidey's maximum amount of web fluid or unlocking new combat moves.</p>\n<p>The main goal in each level is simply to find the exit, but there are other objectives that have to be met, sometimes with a time limit. Spider-Man in particular often has to rescue civilians or disarm bombs. A directional indicator displays where the next objective is to be found. Several of the levels consist purely of boss battles.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Antz Extreme Racing</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6590/super-mario-kart/\">Mario Kart</a>-style kart racing game based on the 1998 animated film. Compared to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7479/antz-extreme-racing/\">console version</a>, the GBA title has its own tracks and modes and displays the tracks through \"Mode 7\"-style 2D scaling and rotation. </p>\n<p>The game contains six different racers (all characters from the film), each with different ratings in speed, brakes and weight, and twelve tracks, only the first eight of which are unlocked from the start. The game's main mode is the 4 Seasons championship, taking players through the twelve tracks consecutively, with finishing in first place a must to advance. Progress is saved via passwords awarded after a win. Further modes are Quick Race (a standard race on unlocked tracks), Head to Head (a one-on-one race against a random opponent on a random track) and the Game Link mode for two-player match-ups via link cable.</p>\n<p>As many kart racers, the game features a variety of power-ups for collecting on the tracks and using during a race. These include turbo boosts, fireflies (self-seekers launching to the front), stun nuts (thrown to the back), bubble gum traps, protective helmets and more. There are also health power-ups since ramming into obstacles decreases health as indicated by a leaf that grows shorter with each hit. Also on the tracks are green items that act as currency. Between races, these can be spent to buy additional power-ups in a store.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance</em> on the Game Boy Advance adapts the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7787/mortal-kombat-deadly-alliance/\">console game of the same name</a> to the portable platform, presenting a subset of characters, arenas and modes, with simplified controls and graphics in line with the handheld's capabilities.</p>\n<p>The game includes 12 characters (down from 23 in the console version) and 13 arenas (down from 17). 7 Fighters and 9 arenas are selectable from the start, the rest have to be unlocked. The unlocking works through the acquisition of \"koins\" (of which there is only one type compared to the six of the console version) that are earned in the game's various modes. The koins can then be spent in the \"Krypt\", unlocking \"koffins\" that reveal characters, arenas, several alternate costumes for each character, and some other surprises. 120 different koffins are available.</p>\n<p>The game's modes include Arcade (a series of consecutive fights against all other characters in the game), Survival (subsequent fights with only a small amount of health restored after each bout) and Link Mode (one-on-one fights via link cable, with players being able to wager their koins). The same two mini-games as in the console version are also included: Test Your Might (the classic button-smasher to break an object) and Test Your Sight (a variation of the shell game: picking out which shell a symbol is under after the shells are shuffled quickly).</p>\n<p>Fights are displayed in a pseudo-3D view, simulated through a scaled and rotated textured floor with 2D backgrounds and the fighters animated in 2D. Fighting takes place on a 2D plane, but side-stepping with the camera then rotating to keep up is possible. Controls are less complex than in the console version: only two attack buttons remain out of the original five: one usually used for kicks, one for punches. The right shoulder button blocks, while the left shoulder button switches between two different fighting styles for each character, each with its unique moves and combos. The third weapon stance from the console version is gone, being replaced instead by special weapon moves for most characters. Fatalities, a Mortal Kombat series trademark, are of course also featured. Exclusive to the GBA version is the inclusion of the morphing ability of series mainstay baddie Shang Tsung, allowing him to take the form of other characters.</p>",

As in the PC and console versions, this mode takes players through the history of Porsche cars from the 1950's 356 to the 1990's GT1, but without any of the economy or customization options. All in all, there are 25 different models available to drive. Evolution mode consists of 15 events, which have to be won in order. Earlier events are single races, later ones include multiple races in a tournament. All are races against 4 opponents, with winning necessary to go to the next event. Each new event unlocks new cars that can also be used in the game's other modes. These include a single player mode that offers quick races as well as knockout (last car after a race is removed) and quick knockout (last car after a lap is removed) races. A multiplayer mode offers races for up to four players via link cable.</p>\n<p>The game includes five different tracks, each with forward and reverse directions and dry, rain and snow weather options. The graphics engine is the same as used in developer Pocketeers earlier <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/61503/need-for-speed-underground/\">NFS Underground</a>, with cars and tracks modeled in texture-mapped 3D. 1st-person cockpit and 3rd-person behind-the-car views are available. Actual racing has a heavy arcade focus, with braking to get around corners rarely necessary since bumping into the road usually only deducts a few kph from the current speed.</p>",

        "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7497/britneys-dance-beat/\">Britney's Dance Beat</a>, the rhythm game licensed from pop star Britney Spears, received its own version for the Game Boy Advance, with similar gameplay, but a unique selection of modes, and graphics and sound tailored to the handheld platform.</p>\n<p>The game's main mode is called Dance Mode. It features two main stages: Practice Mode and Concert Mode. Practice Mode has to be completed first before Concert Mode opens up. Each consists of the same five songs, but Concert Mode increases the difficulty. Actual gameplay consists of a radar-like object spinning clockwise on the left of the screen, highlighting the buttons to be pressed in rhythm with the music, while a rendition of Britney Spears dances along on the right of the screen. Depending on if and how well the notes are hit, a score of either \"great\", \"good\" or \"miss\" is given. The simpler songs in Practice involve only a single button, but later songs include both the A and B buttons, and, in Concert Mode only, also require the D-Pad to be pressed at the same time. To complete a song and move on to the next, a scoring threshold must be met. Finishing a song also unlocks pictures of the star to be looked at in the Tour Book. Finishing every song in Concert Mode unlocks a video clip of a concert performance.</p>\n<p>There is also a two-player mode via link cable, which is similar to the main game mode in the console version: both players have their own rhythm indicator. Good performance allows attacks on the other player, shuffling their controls for additional difficulty. An additional single-player game mode is the Puzzle Mode: a simple sliding puzzle, with four different pictures available (three of which must be unlocked in Dance Mode).</p>\n<p>While the included Britney Spears songs are the same as in the console version, they are not simply played back digitally. Due to hardware limitations, they are only approximated with percussion samples and the occasional voice sample, but the main vocal track is played through a GBA synthesizer.</p>",

Unlike the other application, however, this version doesn't play infinitely: the goal is to get as many heads as possible before getting a tails. If even one tails is flipped, the round is over, and the player must start again. However, the game still keeps track of the percentage of heads the player gets. Only one card is required to play this game: the Supporter Trainer card Bill's Maintenance from the Expedition Base Set.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Fruits Daisakusen!</em> is a Pok\u00e9mon-themed e-Reader application. In the game, Totodile is swimming across a stretch of Tentacruel-infested waters. Its goal is to collect as many pieces of fruit as possible before crossing the finish line at the end, and also to avoid physical contact with the Tentacruel. Using the directional pad allows Totodile to move left and right, while pressing the A button causes it to swimm faster and head to the top of the screen. If Totodile touches a Tentacruel, it is stung, and temporarily becomes immobile. For a few seconds afterward, it flashes and is invincible. Each type of fruit is worth a different amount of points: banana bunches are worth 300, apples are worth 600, melons are worth 1000, and watermelon halves are worth 5000. The entire length of the water is 100 meters. There is a \"timer\" in the bottom left corner of the screen that shows how many meters are left. To play <em>Fruits Daisakusen!</em>, the player needs the following cards from the super-rare Theater Limited VS Pack, which was only distributed in Japanese movie theaters showing <em>Pok\u00e9mon Heroes</em>: Misty's Politoed, Misty's Corsola and Ross's Wailmer.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Tokotoko Truck</em> is a Pok\u00e9mon-themed e-Reader application. In this game the player controls two Pichu (possibly the Pichu Bros.) as they travel down a railroad on a drasine, on their way to Pok\u00e9mon Center Tokyo. A timer is present, which starts at 30 seconds. Along the way, the Pichu will pass several train stations. Each time a train station is passed, a random amount of time is added to the timer, allowing the Pichu more time to reach their destination. However, the tracks are riddled with boulders. Each time the drasine collides with a boulder, it slows down, eating away precious time. The game will end either when the timer runs out (resulting in a game over) or when the Pichu finally reach the Pok\u00e9mon Center. Six cards are needed to play this game, all of which are promotional cards available only at the JR Train Rally in August 2002: Celebi, Entei, Pikachu, Pichu, Mewtwo and Lugia.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Construction: Melody Box</em> is a Pok\u00e9mon-themed e-Reader application. It involves playing a variety of different musical tracks in different ways. The data for this application is found on a great variety of cards. Only one card is technically required to play this game, but the idea is to try as many as possible. There are three types of cards: sound cards, which change the sound or instrument, music cards, which provide a musical piece, and pattern cards, which provide a sort of \"wallpaper\" for the application. The player can use any combination of these, including having just one type of card. Using all three, however, provides the full experience. For example, one combination of cards features Chikorita singing Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 with a Charmender pattern, and another could be a church organ playing Team Rocket's theme from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5515/pokemon-gold-version/\">Pok\u00e9mon Gold</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5426/pokemon-silver-version/\">Silver</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/12055/pokemon-crystal-version/\">Crystal</a> to a Hoppip pattern. Scanning only a pattern card always results in the same tune, and scanning a sound card without a music card plays this same tune in whatever sound is selected. While listening to the music, a Clefairy is shown on screen using Metrenome. The player can move this Clefairy using the D-pad. Moving it left and right slows and speeds up the music, respectively, and moving it up and down increases and decreases the pitch, respectively. Cards for this game can be found in the Expedition Base Set, Aquapolis expansion, Skyridge expansion, McDonald's Original Minimum\u2605Pack, and various promotional cards.</p>",

        "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3578/driver-2/\">Driver 2</a> received a belated adaptation for the Game Boy Advance in <em>Driver 2 Advance</em>. The handheld version adapts the storyline of the original but cuts it down heavily, while presenting the gameplay in a graphics engine tailored to the portable platform.</p>\n<p>As in the original, the player controls undercover cop Tanner, who investigates the murder of a Brazilian criminal, leading him facing both a Brazilian gang as well as the Chicago mob. The story is mainly told through cutscenes that employ stills from the rendered scenes of the original, with dialogue adapted in accordance with the cut-down story. While the original moved through four cities, only two remain in the GBA version: Chicago and Rio de Janeiro.</p>\n<p>Gameplay still takes the form of individual missions that have to be taken on in order. Goals vary between quickly moving to a certain location on the map, following another car, ramming a car to stop it, tailing a car without being seen (neither moving too far away nor too close) and pick-up and delivery jobs. The cities are rendered in texture-mapped 3D, with cars and pedestrians displayed as sprites. Some of the game's missions are direct adaptations from the original, while others are completely new. The Chicago and Rio map layouts are much simplified compared to the original.</p>\n<p>Besides the main Undercover mode, the two cities can be freely explored in Take A Ride mode. The game also includes the same five mini-games as in the PlayStation version, involving ramming a car, losing a police tail, following a path set out by traffic cones, a checkpoint race and a demolition survival. The game also includes four-player-multiplayer via link cable, with four exclusive modes: checkpoint and cross-town racing as well as free-for-all (solo) and cops-n-robbers (team-based) survival.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Construction: Action</em> is a Pok\u00e9mon-themed e-Reader application. In it, multiple cards are scanned to build a mini-platform game. The goal is for the player to catch all the Pok\u00e9mon on the screen before the timer runs out. That said, there are several player characters with different statistics, and the one used depends on the card scanned. Likewise, there are several different maps, each with different Pok\u00e9mon, depending on what card is scanned. One map may be played at a time, but the game is experienced at its fullest when the maximum number of six map cards are scanned, creating a long, multi-screened stage. The player must choose the order of the maps wisely, however, because the layout of the maps may create walls making it impossible to traverse.</p>\n<p>The game is played by throwing Pok\u00e9 Balls at Pok\u00e9mon, and most Pok\u00e9mon take several to catch. The Pok\u00e9mon will also attack the player. The player loses if they fall into a bottomless pit, they get hit by a Pok\u00e9mon's attack, they touch a Pok\u00e9mon, or the timer runs out. If the player runs out of Pok\u00e9 Balls, they will have to look for extras on the map.</p>\n<p>Cards for <em>Construction: Action</em> can be found in the Aquapolis and Skyridge expansions.</p>",

The story is mainly told through cutscenes that employ stills from the rendered scenes of the original, with dialogue adapted to any changes in story. While the original moved through three cities, the city of Istanbul is missing in the GBA version: only Miami and Nice remain.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is mission-based as in the original, with 25 missions in total (12 in Miami, 13 in Nice). Goals include chasing cars, getting to a certain location within a time limit, protecting another character, evading police, taking part in shootouts, and much more. Many missions consist of multiple objectives that have to be accomplished. Between missions, the two cities can be freely explored, and several secrets and some extra challenges be found, including four different driving mini-games: Trailblazer (following a trail of traffic cones), Destruction (driving over a number of crates), Slalom (navigating between gates) and Checkpoint (racing between different points on the map).</p>\n<p>The graphics engine is similar to the one used in developer <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Velez+%26+Dubail\">Velez &amp; Dubail</a>'s earlier GBA titles like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/69505/v-rally-3/\">V-Rally 3</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10214/stuntman/\">Stuntman</a>, with the environment modeled in texture-mapped 3D and cars and characters as sprites.</p>",

It offers simpler gameplay, harkening back to early arcade entries in the Gauntlet series, with unique levels based on a selection of the other versions' themes.</p>\n<p>Players can select from four characters in their quest to defeat the evil sorcerer Garm: archer, wizard, warrior and valkyrie, all with a unique weapon and different ratings in strength, speed, armor and magic. Starting from a hub world, players must fight their way through five different realms: Mountain Kingdom, Castle Stronghold, Desert Lands, Ice Domain and Dream World. Each consists of five levels, with a boss waiting in the final one. Only after all realms have been conquered will the path to the final battle against Garm and the demon Skorne open up.</p>\n<p>The levels are displayed in isometric perspective and are huge and labyrinthine. Gameplay follows the classic Gauntlet template: many monsters have to be destroyed alongside the generators that spawn them while the player looks for the exit. Keys must be found to open doors and gates, food replenishes health and potions give an extra powerful magic attack. Piles of coins lie around and can be picked up, but there is no way to spend the gold as in other versions. Some timed powerups can also be found, including triple and five-way shots, rapid fire, speed boost and a reflective shield. Killing monsters gives experience, with attributes and health increasing automatically on level-up. The game can be saved to cartridge memory in the hub world.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Released in conjunction with a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7790/hot-wheels-velocity-x/\">version on console and PC</a>, <em>Hot Wheels: Velocity X</em> on Game Boy Advance is not an adaptation, but an entirely unique game. It shares the general concept and some characters, but has its own story, modes and gameplay style.</p>\n<p>The evil MetaCog attacks Hot Wheels HQ, putting the engineers to sleep with his hypnotic headlight, stealing five cars along with five parts of a new prototype. The Professor finds that his robot Gear Head isn't affected by the hypnosis, so he modifies him to become a top racer, able to beat MetaCog and his gang bosses and recapture the stolen parts and cars.</p>\n<p>In the game's main Story Mode, the player controls Gear Head through five different worlds of seven missions each. The missions include races (in which the only goal is to cross the finish line first), stunt challenges (performing moves during jumps for points) as well as other objective-based missions: these include finding objects in a level within a time limit, playing a game of tag with a bomb (putting it on an enemy car before it explodes), protecting another car that is on a special mission, and many more. The final level in each world is a confrontation against one of the gang bosses, involving a race followed by a combat duel against the boss.</p>\n<p>Races and missions are seen from an isometric perspective. Controls can be adjusted between track-relative and car-relative. The tracks feature a lot of jumps, loops and corkscrews, through which cars automatically move - there is no falling off or failing a jump. Scattered around the tracks are power-ups, including various weapons (necessary for the combat missions, but also useful in all others), a shield, a repair kit and more.</p>\n<p>Completing missions in Story Mode unlocks new cars (there is a total of 30 cars in the game, each with different ratings in speed, acceleration, traction and armor) and makes the completed levels available for the game's other modes. These include Race Mode which allows standard races with number of opponents and laps adjustable, with three tracks per world available. Challenge mode has two varieties per world: Battles require the player to destroy all other cars in the level within a time limit, Tag requires the player to tag all other cars without getting tagged back, also within a time limit.</p>\n<p>There is an in-game database of cars, characters, power-ups and stunt moves whose entries are unlocked by moving through Story Mode. Game progress is saved via passwords. The game also features connectivity to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7790/hot-wheels-velocity-x/\">GameCube version</a>, which is the only way to unlock certain cars.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Dreamcast cult classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4126/jet-grind-radio/\">Jet Grind Radio</a>'s adaptation to the Game Boy Advance takes the concept of the original game and distills it for the capabilities of the handheld, with somewhat simplified gameplay and the levels adapted from cel-shaded 3D to isometric 2D.</p>\n<p>The story is the same as in the original game: in the near-future metropolis of Tokyo-to, the player controls members of the teen gang the GG's, who are in a turf war with rival gangs and must also avoid the law in the form of Captain Onishima and his forces. Players must skate through fifteen distinct levels, collecting spray cans and spraying graffiti at certain spots within a time limit while avoiding the cops.</p>\n<p>Most of the original game's levels have been transposed to the isometric viewpoint (two have been combined into one), even though some of the interactivity is lost (like traffic or sprayers from rival gangs). The graphics engine used is similar to that in developer Vicarious Visions's earlier entries in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/21922/tony-hawks-pro-skater-2/\">Tony</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/31002/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3/\">Hawk</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/31004/tony-hawks-pro-skater-4/\">series</a>.</p>\n<p>Progressing through the game unlocks several unique mini-games that can be played by up to four players via link cable: Throw Down and Tricky can be played in teams. Tricky is a run for a high score by performing tricks and stunts, Throw Down asks players to knock each other over and spray the other's backs for points. Turf Wars asks players to tag designated areas, while Killer Crush is a two-player race for a tagging spot.</p>\n<p>Like the original, the GBA version features a Create-A-Graffiti mode. A unique feature is Jet Set Radio DJ Professor K as an unlockable playable character. The game features cut-down loops of six of the original game's signature music tracks.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Minority Report</em> on the Game Boy Advance is based on the 2002 Spielberg/Cruise film. In the near future, murders have become rare. The Precrime division of the police, employing future visions of mutated humans called Precogs, can predict when and where a homicide will take place, and arrest the perpetrator before the crime is committed. Precrime officer John Anderton is one of the best at his job, but finds himself on the run when the Precogs predict him murdering a man he doesn't even know. The game follows the film only in its most basic aspects, with almost no characters from the film except Anderton himself appearing, and the storyline moving along an entirely different path. Comic-style images illustrate the story between levels.</p>\n<p>The player controls Anderton through ten side-scrolling levels displayed in a pseudo-3D view. The first few involve him trying to arrest criminals, later ones find him hunted by his own colleagues. In both cases, he must shoot down hordes of enemies (with non-lethal weapons) to progress toward a boss enemy. Shooting involves cycling through available targets via the shoulder buttons, taking care not to target any innocent civilians - hitting them costs one life. Anderton can take cover by dashing into obstacles, enabling him to pick off his targets from relative safety. Six different weapons become available during the game - from a simple pistol with unlimited ammo to more advanced automatic weapons and grenade launchers. There are also hand grenades and, if all else fails, melee attacks. Health and ammo refills as well as bonus lives are available as pickups.</p>",

This is done by challenging other racers - winning against them unlocks their car for playing. All in all, there are 42 cars in the game, differing in top speed, acceleration, handling, durability as well as the number of nitros available. Most are won in races, others can be unlocked in ways that are less obvious.</p>\n<p>There are two types of race: waypoint races are entered by spotting a so called \"hook man\" on the streets and following them around until a symbol on their head turns from red to yellow to green. The waypoint race itself is against the hook man and several of his gang, and consists of a number of waypoints that must be hit in order to finish. A green arrow displays the nearest waypoint, which is not neccesarily the next in line, though. The second type of race is head-to-head. These are triggered by calling the opponent on their cell phone, challenging them to a one-on-one. Progress in career mode is saved via passwords awarded after a won race.</p>\n<p>Arcade mode allows players to replay content unlocked in Career mode. The two cities can be freely explored in Joyride mode (with amount of traffic adjustable), and all Career waypoint and head-to-head races can be relived as well.</p>",

Both can be selected in either a full Championship or a Quick Race. Racing is divided into 250cc and 125cc classes, each with its own selection of 16 different professional riders, with Freestyle having another 8 riders. There are 12 racing tracks and 4 freestyle tracks. More racing is available in the US Open mode, which offers a special track not available in the other modes.</p>\n<p>Races consist of several heats. The first three in the first and second heat move on straight to the finals, with a third \"last chance\" heat requiring one to finish first or second to advance to the finals. Freestyle competitions on the other hand involve a two-minute solo run, with the rider with the most points being declared the winner.</p>\n<p>The game employs textured-mapped polygonal graphics for the track and 2D bitmaps for the riders, with the camera always behind the player. Controls are relatively simple compared to the console version, with only steering, accelerating and breaking being of importance for races, and slight air control plus pressing shoulder button and D-pad combinations for tricks necessary during freestyle.</p>\n<p>The game allows to set dry, wet or random weather, race lengths between two and six laps and also features a tune-up mode, in which tires, muffler, gears, springs and torque tuning can be set before a race. Championship progress is saved via passwords.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Rugrats Go Wild</em> is based on the 2003 animated film of the same name, which crosses over the Nickelodeon TV series <em>Rugrats</em> and <em>The Wild Thornberrys</em>. It is broadly similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9800/rugrats-go-wild/\">movie's adaptation for PC</a>, but has its own interpretation of the movie's story and unique level design and gameplay.</p>\n<p>Both the Rugrats and the Thornberrys are stranded on an uninhabited island after a storm wrecked their ship. Players will control Timmy, Eliza and Lil &amp; Phil on their quest to find missing family members. The maze-like island is seen from an overhead view. When another character is found, they usually offer a fetch mission - finding items like fish, magazines, boots, keys, etc. When the item is found and returned, either the path to the next level or a mini-game will open up. Most of the mini-games fall into two categories: a side-scrolling platformer and a top-down racing game. </p>\n<p>In the platformer, the goal is to defeat a number of animals by throwing gooshy balls at them. The balls can be collected both on the main island map as well as in the side-scrolling levels. Once all animals are defeated, a fight against a tougher boss follows. The racing game has varying objectives, like chasing an animal or collecting a number of objects on the track. Once that goal is reached, there is also a boss confrontation: the boss is trying to catch the player and the goal is to keep away from him until a time limit runs out. Completing a mini-game will usually award an item that another character needs.</p>\n<p>Should the player get hurt during a mini-game, glowing balls can be collected to refill the health bar (represented by a milk bottle for the Rugrats and a water bottle for Eliza Thornberry). An overview map of the whole island can be used to quickly move to places already explored. Progress in the game is saved via passwords.</p>",

This is mainly done by approaching the sheep, which makes them move into the opposite direction. This way they must be guided around obstacles and away from dangers. The dog can also grab a sheep to carry it, bark to encourage movement further and leave treats behind for the sheep to follow him.</p>\n<p>Players can select from two different dogs at the start of the game who differ in attributes like speed and strength. Further dogs can be unlocked by playing through the game's various modes. The main mode is called Normal Mode and presents the levels grouped into four different stages. Within a stage, the levels can be tackled in any order, but only once all levels are done the next stage opens up. Before a level, the type of sheep to be herded can be selected. Some types are more difficult to control, resulting in a higher score multiplier.</p>\n<p>The game's second mode is called Arrange Mode. It features the same stages and levels, but introduces a new element: the leveling up of sheep and dog. The dog levels up by reaching a certain score, which increases his abilities. The sheep also level up, mainly by performing certain feats within a level. This can become problematic if a sheep reaches a higher level than the dog, making it prone to disobedience.</p>\n<p>Once one of the regular modes is finished, a Training Mode opens up that allows one to select any level directly.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Almost two years after its release on consoles, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5569/the-simpsons-road-rage/\">The Simpsons: Road Rage</a> was adapted for the Game Boy Advance. While it retains the general gameplay concept inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3575/crazy-taxi/\">Crazy Taxi</a>, it has a reduced selection of drivers and cars, unique playing modes and missions, and adapts the 3D graphics of the original to a Mode-7-style sprite scaling and rotation engine.</p>\n<p>The game's main mode is called Road Rage. Just like in <em>Crazy Taxi</em>, the goal is to pick up passengers and deliver them to their destination within a time limit, earning money in the process. Bonuses are awarded for arrival speed and hitting the target exactly. Special objectives might appear during a fare for additional bonus: either hitting a certain number of cars or avoiding hitting any traffic at all.</p>\n<p>The second main game mode is entirely new: in Performance Mode, players select one passenger to take on and must offer them an exciting ride: the different characters' preferences for jumps, hitting cars and hitting roadside objects differ. They must be taken into account in order to take the passenger's excitement meter to its heights, resulting in cash being awarded.</p>\n<p>The Mission Mode is similar to that in the console version: in each of the ten missions, one specific character is controlled in order to reach a certain goal, like driving over a number of objects, or racing a course, all within a time limit. Some of the missions are based on those of the console version, others are entirely new.</p>\n<p>A Head-to-Head multiplayer mode via link cable is also available: in these, two players compete to pick up a single passenger and deliver him to his destination. By bumping into the other player, the passenger can be forced to switch cars.</p>\n<p>The game includes 16 different vehicles (driven by 15 Simpsons characters) and six different locations. Only five drivers and one location are available from the start. More vehicles are unlocked in Road Rage mode, more locations in Performance Mode, and further extras (like a car color editor) in Mission Mode. The locations are based on those from the console game, but with some differences in track layout. None of the signature locations from the TV series are featured however - drop off points are generic. Unlocked environments can be freely explored in Sunday Drive mode.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=SpyHunter\">modern update</a> of the classic arcade game <em>Spy Hunter</em> was also adapted for the Game Boy Advance. It adapts roughly half of the console version's missions, albeit with completely changed level designs that fit with the Mode 7-style sprite scaling and rotation engine, and adds several unique gameplay modes of its own.</p>\n<p>The player controls the advanced G-6155 Interceptor car to combat the evil Nostra Corporation. The game's main Normal Agent mode consists of seven different missions. Each mission has one primary and several secondary objectives, to be finished within a time limit. The primary goal must be met to unlock the next mission, the secondary goals are only necessary to unlock further game modes. Objectives include destroying certain targets, moving through slalom obstacles, avoiding civilian casualties, activating Satcoms by driving over them, making long jumps, and more. Various enemies will be on the road that can be attacked with the Interceptor's weapons, including machine guns, missiles and rail guns. There are also defensive weapons like smoke screens and oil slicks. The weapons can be either found as pick-ups on the road or by finding and driving into the classic weapons van.</p>\n<p>The seven mission levels can also be played in Special Agent mode. This involves the levels being filled with chickens, with the goal being to drive over or shoot as many chickens as possible. An extra unlockable mode is Secret Agent mode. It is similar to the regular mission mode and features the same levels and objectives, but different placement of objects and enemies. Also unlockable is Arcade mode, a free run through a level with the goal to cause as much destruction as possible for a high score. The game also features a two-player mode via link cable. The players compete to either activate more Satcoms or kill more chickens.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>SSX Tricky</em>, the second game in EA Sports' snowboarding series, received an adaptation for the Game Boy Advance one year after the game's release <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5327/ssx-tricky/\">on consoles</a>. It adapts the console game's main playing modes, but removes a lot of the details and remodels all tracks into its own 3D engine in line with the handheld's capabilities.</p>\n<p>The game's main playing mode is World Circuit mode, taking players through either Race or Showoff competitions through eight courses. Gaining medals in World Circuit unlocks more characters to select, and courses to play in Single Event mode, which offers a Time Challenge mode in addition to Races and Showoffs. Races are competitions against four other boarders, while Showoffs require performing tricks to score points. Time Challenge is a time-limited run down a course in which performing tricks and combos is necessary to enhance the time limit. Neither board and boarder customization nor boarder rivalries from the console version made the transition to the GBA.</p>\n<p>The tracks are based on those in the console version, but are completely redesigned. They now resemble more realistic winter sports courses and feature none of the extravagant drops, shortcuts and tunnels of the original game. The graphics engine employs texture-mapped polygons for the courses and 2D animated sprites for the boarders, with the camera always behind the player.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Barnyard</em> is based on the animated movie of the same name. It is set on a farm where all animals can talk and walk, but only when no humans are around. The player takes the role of a new arrival, either a male or female cow, who has to finds its place inside the community. While the basic gameplay mechanics are almost identical to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/27910/barnyard/\">console version</a>, many aspects are simplified, e.g. the overall size, the mini game complexity and the graphical presentation (top-down instead of behind-the-shoulder).</p>\n<p>The basic gist is that the player walks around freely in the unlocked portions of the farm, talks to other animals with exclamation points on their head and solves fetch quests for them. While some of those quests are mandatory to progress the plot, others are side content and only serve to earn money in order to buy decorations for the night festivities (there is a day/night circle and the character automatically goes to sleep at 2 a.m.). When entering more dangerous areas of the farm, there are enemies which take away life energy when touched. They can either be avoided or fought by shooting milk at them (which involves rotating the character so the udder aims in the enemy's direction).</p>\n<p>The main character has three stats which can be improved during the course of the game: life energy, milk capacity and running speed. The latter is important because the cow can only run a short amount of time before running out of breath, but later there is a bicycle which helps moving around. Additionally there are a few optional mini games.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>V-Rally 3</em> for the Game Boy Advance adapts the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7034/v-rally-3/\">console game of the same name</a> to the handheld platform, offering its own selection of cars, tracks, modes and a platform-appropriate graphics engine.</p>\n<p>The main game mode is V-Rally Mode. It takes players through a rally championship over seven different countries, with each country's course consisting of distinct stages. Stages are taken on in groups of two, allowing for changing of car setup and repairs after every pair. Car setup options include a choice of tires (appropriate to road and weather conditions) as well as suspension, steering, brakes and gearbox. Bumping into the roadside during a race damages the car, with body, suspension, brakes, steering and turbos getting individual damage ratings. The repairs must be possible to be carried out within a time window or there is no choice but to drive on with the damage.</p>\n<p>The game contains 10 licensed cars from 9 manufacturers, of which only two are available from the start. Winning a rally championship unlocks further cars. Driving the more powerful unlocked cars increases the game's difficulty, requiring much better times to keep ahead of the competition.</p>\n<p>The game's second major mode is called V-Rally Cross and offers traditional circuit racing on five different tracks. Only one is available from the start, the others have to be unlocked by winning on the earlier tracks. Races are against three opponents and consist of two rounds of three laps each, one in forward, one in reverse direction. Performing well in the first round fills a boost meter that can be utilized in the second.</p>\n<p>Time Trial mode allows single runs utilizing cars and tracks unlocked in the other modes. Multiplayer is available via the link cable and offers two-player versions of V-Rally Cross and Time Trial.</p>\n<p>The game's graphics engine renders the tracks in texture-mapped 3D, with backgrounds, scenery (like trees and spectators) and the cars themselves displayed as 2D bitmaps. Graphical effects include rain, snow, fog and nighttime conditions. By default, the camera is behind the car, but there is also a first-person cockpit perspective (not available in V-Rally Cross) that shows the driver's hands steering and shifting and also displays damage to the car as cracks in the windshield.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Tir et but: \u00c9dition champion du monde</em> is an adaptation of the dice football game created by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Michel+Bouchet\">Michel Bouchet</a>. It simulates football matches through players taking turns to throw dice for attack and defense moves. Combinations are formed through multiple throws of three blue dice (attack). Further gameplay also involves a white one (more risk through double or nothing), a green one, and a red one (defense). The concept borrows some elements from poker dice with risk assessment based on retaining dice after the first throw. The gameplay involves different types of shots, but also penalties and foul cards (causing a player to wait a turn).</p>\n<p>At the start of the game the original or the arcade mode needs to be chosen. In the original mode all actions are shown on a stadium board, while the arcade mode shows the actual shots and the keeper's defense. Further options then include training, a versus game, a friendly match or a full cup. In the training mode shots can be practiced as in a regular football game, by timing a button press for power and then determining a direction for the shot. Each type of shot (lob, volley, penalty ...) has slightly different game mechanics, with both offensive and defensive sides. The game includes a selection of French teams and countries playing in the World Cup. The versus mode can be played against another player using a Link cable.</p>",

The GBA version is in 2D and is completely different from the 3D <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/16502/titeuf-mega-compet/\">Titeuf: M\u00e9ga compet'</a> game for PS2 and Windows. After seeing a program about cloning on television, Titeuf and his classmates are worried they will be cloned as well. They participate in different activities to prevent this from happening.</p>\n<p>After each activity points can be earned in three categories: <em>m\u00e9ga bisou</em>, <em>m\u00e9ga style</em> and <em>m\u00e9ga b\u00eatise</em>. The environment of the school acts as the main hub. It it shown through a top-down view and a star can be moved to scroll and select an activity. There are various mini-games. In one Titeuf is positioned on a window up high and he needs to pee on his classmates without hitting any passing adults. The player has to direct the stream. Another one shows him from a top-down view running in the park. He needs to hit his friends with a water gun before time runs out, also avoiding adults. The gun regularly needs to be refilled at the fountain. In another Titeuf needs to select a cool magazine at the newsagent's and avoid bad ones. At school he needs to undress a woman in a picture as quickly as possible by picking the next item of clothing to remove out of three options before time runs out.</p>\n<p>The game uses a calendar system for a school week and a certain amount of points need to be earned before the week is over. Through a cell phone in the top left corner text messages can be received. Titeuf can reply, choosing from different options, to send gag texts. Next to the main single-player mode there is the <em>m\u00e9ga compet'</em> mode where various mini-games can be accessed directly. In this mode up to two players are supported. An example is a vertical split-screen running game where the characters need to jump over obstacles.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Titeuf: Ze Gag Machine</em> is an action game based on the <em>Titeuf</em> comic books series. Players control Titeuf as he attempts to play tricks on people in his environment. The challenge mode consists of a series of levels with specific objects. In each one Titeuf runs around in an environment such as the school or a playground. He can pick up objects such as bananas, firecrackers, exploding cans, toy cars etc. He needs to launch these at the people in the environment to scare them or to make them slip. The opponents have three alert states: blue, yellow and red. Blue means it is safe to launch the object, yellow means he is spotted and red makes them chase after Titeuf.</p>\n<p>Titeuf can be moved in eight directions. He receives points (trophies) for completing a gag. When an enemy has a red alert state, the player quickly need to press B to sprint and avoid a confrontation. If he is caught, a life (a red star) is lost, but additional ones can be picked up sometimes. After a while chasing opponents will become tired and return to a blue state. There are various objectives to complete, such as performing a number of gags, collecting other types of items, or sprinting for a certain amount of time. When the objective is complete, the exit is opened up. After each completed challenge Titeuf's performance is rated, also taking into account the amount of time. The second mode, crash test, is a practice mode where all objects are available right away, there is an unlimited amount of lives and there is no time limit. A password system based on objects can be used to continue playing a next time.</p>",

Later that evening, as they check the buffet and meet many other invited guests, pleasantries are exchanged and small talks reveal little to nothing of interest... until, a body falls down on a sports car that was on the display in the lobby area.

        "description": "<p><em>No Rules: Get Phat</em> is an action game where the player controls the little boy One Eye Jack. While he is watching television the broadcast is interrupted by aliens who announce to invade the planet. Jack sets out to stop that. The game contains five worlds that consist of 2D side-scrolling platforming environments. Jack moves to the left or right on his skateboard and is able to duck, and jump to dodge enemies and obstacles and to get on top of platforms. A slingshot is used to attack, as well as a spinning move. He can aim to the right as well as upwards. Levels encourage exploration and often have a vertical design where he can use windows to reach higher parts of a level. Jack has a limited amount of health replenished by grabbing first aid kits. There is a set amount of lives and additional ones are collected by finding icons that represent his head. There are also sections where he can grind rails, ledges and horizontal surfaces and grab vinyl records. By collecting all of them in a single level, additional moves and tricks are unlocked.</p>\n<p>Next to the platforming sections he needs to defeat aliens at the end of levels in sequences similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dance+Dance+Revolution\">Dance Dance Revolution</a> games where the directional buttons need to be pressed at the right moment to match the beat, appearing in a bar from the right side of the screen in a vinyl shop. This leaves the alien open to an attack and the A button is then used to scratch and attack. The game package includes a physical fingerboard.</p>",

He must have his hand under a ball when it reaches his hands' level, or else it will fall to the ground and break in two, resulting in a game over.</p>\n<p>The game is presented with Game &amp; Watch style graphics.

New modes coming over from the consoles are Two Minute Drill, Practice, Situation, and the Madden Cards card collecting sub-game. Gone however is player creation with its associated mini-games.</p>\n<p>The graphics engine is still sprite-based and takes after the early installments of the series on Genesis and SNES. The game includes the 32 teams of the 2004 NFL season, with updated rosters and stats. Season progress and team stats are saved to battery-backed RAM, there is commentary by John Madden and Al Michaels, and the game also offers a two-player option via link cable.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Hello Kitty: Happy Party Pals</em> Hello Kitty needs help to organize parties. The game consists of different levels (parties) that need to be planned. This includes inviting guests, gathering supplies and keeping everyone happy. The guests' happiness is shown through a percentage by talking to them, but it is also visible through a meter above their heads. If a certain rating is achieved Hello Kitty can move on to the next level. The game contains many <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Sanrio\">Sanrio</a> characters and it is the first <em>Hello Kitty</em> game for the GBA.</p>\n<p>The first party is a small one in Kitty's playroom and she needs to invite two family members. Kitty can freely move around in the house to collect supplies such as a table cloth, a music disc, balloons etc. The gathered supplies are stored in a journal. The journal also shows who to invite. Kitty needs to do this by walking up to them and initiating a conversation. The guests are not always the same and items are not always in the same location. When talking to a potential guest their happiness rating is shown. By talking to them or giving items that rating can be improved, but only up to a certain level. The final part of the planning is decorating the room, with, for instance, the cloth and the balloons. Once the party starts Kitty can talk to the characters or play music to improve their happiness rating. The music needs to be matched with the guests. Old tunes will only make the elder people happy, but young people can for instance be given cake instead or you can play a game with them.</p>\n<p>Many parts of the planning involve mini-games. Kitty can for instance make cakes. She needs to pour dough on a cooker with six burners, quickly flip them to prevent them from burning and then transfer them to a plate with a time limit of one minute. The second party takes place in the garden and Kitty can play the Bouncing Balloons mini-game in the sandbox, a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Bust-A-Move\">Bust-A-Move</a> clone. Based on the player's score various types of food are provided for the party. With each new party new environments are introduced, such as a garden, a park, an arcade etc. with more guests and items.</p>\n<p>The third party is a park picnic. It has a mini-game that is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Concentration\">Concentration</a> variant, matching identical cards. Guests can also be made happy by playing the Cutie Catch game. It is based on throwing a ball by determining the angle and the power of the throw so the other character can catch it and vice versa. The fourth party takes place at a Sushi restaurant and the fifth one at the Arcade. Other mini-games are a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dance+Dance+Revolution\">Dance Dance Revolution</a>-like rhythm game, a sliding puzzle game, and designing custom invitations in a simplified art program, using images and colours that match the recipient's taste. Many items and activities return for the different parties. After each completed level a password is provided and it possible to access the thirteen mini-games right away from the main menu.</p>",

It features 25 cars that can be taken for races on 16 different tracks.</p>\n<p>The game's main Grand Prix mode is organized into four increasingly difficult cups that have to be taken on in order, each consisting of two sets of four races. Finishing in first or second place in a race is necessary to advance - finishing further behind costs a life.\nRaces are displayed in a Mode-7-style sprite scaling and rotation engine, with cars displayed as rendered bitmaps. Many of the courses take the miniature car concept literally and take place in large everyday locations like a bathroom, a piano or a billiard table. Winning races earns money that can be spent to tune cars by purchasing new engines, mufflers, computers and other components, increasing top speed, acceleration or traction. Only five cars are available for selection from the start, the others have to be unlocked through winning in Grand Prix mode or beating time records. Progress in Grand Prix mode is stored to battery-backed RAM.</p>\n<p>Further game modes include single races and time trials on courses unlocked in Grand Prix mode. There is also a two-player mode via link cable, requiring both players to have their own cartridge.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Superman Returns: Fortress of Solitude</em> is a tie-in to the 2006 film <em>Superman Returns</em>. Unlike most Superman games, which have a heavy action focus, <em>Fortress of Solitude</em> is instead primarily a puzzle game, with only minor action elements.</p>\n<p>The game consists of twenty chapters, each consisting of a set of crystals in the Fortress of Solitude. Behind each crystal is one puzzle challenge. There are two kinds of puzzles: Kryptonex is a Sudoku variant with crystals instead of numbers. The board of cells must be filled with crystals, with only one kind of crystal per row, column and group allowed. The board is pre-filled with some crystals so players can deduce where to begin.</p>\n<p>The second type of puzzle is called Crystallization. In this game, rows and columns must be filled with crystals. Completing a row or column energizes it and removes the crystals. The goal is to energize the entire board. Crystals (taken from a group of three, with random additions after removal) can only be placed next to other crystals that have either the same shape or color. Only wild card crystals can be placed anywhere.</p>\n<p>Superman's powers can be used to help in puzzle completion. Each use of a power depletes a power meter which slowly recharges. \nIn Kryptonex, Superman can show the correct crystal placement of the entire board for a short time or put the correct crystal into the current cell. In Crystallization, he can energize fields without having to complete a row or column. In both games, he can also stop the clock for a short while.</p>\n<p>The puzzles come in three different difficulties, with higher ones being played on larger boards. Some of the crystal challenges require playing several boards in a row. All puzzles within a chapter must be completed within a time limit. It is possible to replay puzzles to improve the completion time, leaving more time for the remaining tasks. Completing a chapter unlocks a digitized picture from the movie.</p>\n<p>Besides the puzzling, there is also a small action game. During each chapter, one of Superman's arch-enemies (including the likes of Metallo, Brainiac, or Mr. Mxyzptlk) will attack and send his minions. In a side-scrolling shooter level, it is then Superman's task to shoot down the minions, who come in red and blue varieties. Red ones must be taken out with super breath; blue ones with heat vision. Shooting down a group leaves a red or blue crystal. Collecting enough crystals before the level ends is necessary to defeat the bad guy.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Disney\u2022Pixar Cars</em> is a racing game based on the animated movie of the same name. The player takes the role of Lightning McQueen in his quest to win the Piston Cup. </p>\n<p>There are two types of events: eleven regular races and four Piston Cup races. The regular races (involving racing either against the clock or against competition) take place on courses with curves, obstacles (e.g. road blocks and slow cars in the way) and pads which either increase or decrease Lightning's speed when driving over them. The Piston Cup courses are oval, without obstacles, and Lightning can build up a nitro boost by closely driving behind opposing cars. Winning a race unlocks the next event, still images from the movie and additional cars. However, each event has to be won with Lightning before another car can be used.</p>\n<p>The camera moves with the course (for example the perspective is close to top-down when driving north and isometric when driving north-west) and is relatively close to the car. In order to know where to steer, the game shows a direction arrow before turns; optionally the player can also activate a reduced map with the course direction of the next few meters. Two buttons are used to speed up or brake.</p>",

Now that Diablos has killed all but one of the antenna trees, it's up to Kyou to stop him before the two worlds are completely separated, which would leave Kyou stuck in the Denj\u016b world forever.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is similar to the original pair of <em>Telefang</em> games, but with some added enhancements. Several new Denj\u016b are available, and many old ones now have different evolution methods. Attacks now receive their own typing independent of the Denj\u016b, meaning a monster with the right move can cover its own weaknesses in battle. New types of items are also introduced, including healing items and ones that increase the chance of a defeated Denj\u016b sharing its phone number with Kyou. Lastly, befriended Denj\u016b have their own friends, which may randomly appear to assist in battle even if Kyou has never met them before.</p>\n<p>As with the earlier games in the series, <em>Power Version</em> was released as part of a pair, with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Keitai+Denj%C5%AB+Telefang+2:+Speed+Version\">Speed Version</a> being its counterpart. Certain Denj\u016b are exclusive to one version or the other, and players can connect their games via Game Link Cable in order to trade and battle their collected Denj\u016b.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In this second paired game in the <em>Keitai Denj\u016b Telefang</em> series, a new T-Fanger named Kyou becomes involved in a struggle against the evil Denj\u016b named Diablos, who wants to permanently cut off humanity's access to the Denj\u016b world. Now that Diablos has killed all but one of the antenna trees, it's up to Kyou to stop him before the two worlds are completely separated, which would leave Kyou stuck in the Denj\u016b world forever.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is similar to the original pair of <em>Telefang</em> games, but with some added enhancements. Several new Denj\u016b are available, and many old ones now have different evolution methods. Attacks now receive their own typing independent of the Denj\u016b, meaning a monster with the right move can cover its own weaknesses in battle. New types of items are also introduced, including healing items and ones that increase the chance of a defeated Denj\u016b sharing its phone number with Kyou. Lastly, befriended Denj\u016b have their own friends, which may randomly appear to assist in battle even if Kyou has never met them before.</p>\n<p>As with the earlier games in the series, <em>Speed Version</em> was released as part of a pair, with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Keitai+Denj%C5%AB+Telefang+2:+Power+Version\">Power Version</a> being its counterpart. Certain Denj\u016b are exclusive to one version or the other, and players can connect their games via Game Link Cable in order to trade and battle their collected Denj\u016b.</p>",

Like the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/36969/disneys-donald-duck-goin-quackers/\">GBC version</a>, the GBA release is a traditional 2D side-scroller.</p>\n<p>The storyline is the same as in the other versions: Merlock has kidnapped Daisy Duck and Donald tries to rescue her with the help of Gyro Gearloose's teleporter. Donald must move through four environments, each consisting of shorter levels: Duckie Mountain, Duckburg, Magica De Spell's manor and Merlock's temple. The goal in most levels is to collect three energy spheres, which will make the level exit open up. To get to them, Donald must take out or evade many enemies, jump over dangerous gaps and brave other hazards. To do so, he can attack, jump on top of enemies and even double jump. He can also start running, a skill used to jump farther or to survive in one of the chase levels. One level in each of the four worlds differs from the norm in that Donald either has to flee from an enemy or try to catch something. Each level features several setback points for restarting upon loss of a life. The levels include a lot of stars that Donald can collect. Collecting 100 awards a life and collecting all stars in all levels unlocks a secret bonus. Progress in the game is stored via passwords.</p>",

The goal is to collect the highest number of M&amp;M's minis. Green spaces add minis, red spaces remove them. Yellow spaces allow players to swap places with another player. Gold spaces do nothing, while blue spaces launch one of sixteen mini-games in which players compete for M&amp;M's. These include catching falling candies, playing mini-golf, basketball or dodgeball, or a top-down race through a labyrinth to get to the sweets. Other game board spaces include teleporters and random events (wheel-of-fortune style).</p>\n<p>Up to four players can play the game. On a single GBA, CPU players can join in, while multiplayer requires several GBAs connected via link cable. Four different game boards are available that can be played either in single games or in a tournament. A game in progress is stored to battery-backed RAM to be resumed later. The mini-games can also be played directly from the menu.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Land Before Time</em> for Game Boy Advance is a side-scrolling platform game based on the cartoon franchise. The dinosaur friends have been lost after running away from a sharptooth. It's now up to Littlefoot to rescue his friends and together they must find a way back home to the Great Valley.</p>\n<p>The game consists of five different levels, each made up of four smaller stages. Environments include a desert, a swamp, mountains, a cave and a volcano. In the first level, players can only control Littlefoot, but subsequent stages add the rest of the gang as controllable characters, adding Cera, Spike and Ducky. The difference between the characters is mostly visual, since they have almost the same abilities.</p>\n<p>The goal in the first stages of each level is simply to find the exit. The dinosaur heroes can walk, run, jump and double-jump to make their way across platforms, traps, quicksand, water and other obstacles. Enemy dinos can be defeated by jumping on top of them or striking them with a normal attack. Glowing orbs are setback points that allow resuming upon loss of a life. Arrows point the direction to the goal in the first level only. The final stage in every world is a boss battle against a large enemy, including the likes of a huge scorpion, a T. Rex and a spider.</p>\n<p>Scattered over the levels are tree stars. Collecting 100 of them in one stage unlocks an arcade mini-game. After every main level, a password is given for resuming at a later date.</p>",

There no longer is a license for real players' names, though, so all players are fictional. Returning game modes are friendlies, the international cup and penalty shootouts. The new Super Star Mode is a series of do-or-die three-minute matches against superstar teams.</p>\n<p>The view on the pitch has been adjusted from the isometric perspective of the predecessor to a view from the sidelines. As before, the game allows to set a variety of formations and strategies. It also includes a choice of weather, different stadiums and referees, and again, running commentary by Jon Champion and a two-player mode via link cable.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Mystery Inc. gang meet with their friend, Eric Staufer, a computer science major at the university, who created a laser that has the ability to send people into cyberspace. A video game featuring Scooby and the gang was designed to test the laser, but during the test, a Phantom Virus has escaped from cyberspace, and begins wreaking havoc in the university. Can Mystery Inc. stop the Phantom Virus, and find out who is responsible for releasing it?</p>\n<p>In <em>Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase</em> for Gameboy Advance, you must discover the identity of the suspect responsible for unleashing the Phantom Virus. This is done by navigating seven levels; the main lab level, which contains CDs, grant access to six additional levels, which may only be reached via the computer in cyberspace, and the laser in the robotics lab section of the main level sends a character there. Each member of the Mystery Inc. gang is available, but only one character may play at a time. Only two CDs are available at the start. Two additional CDs are gained upon completion of a computer level, which appear in the main lab level in the Computer Lab room, and when picked up unlocks more computer levels in the game to complete. You cannot enter the computer levels unless you pick up the CDs from the main lab level.</p>\n<p>Each level consists of various pick-ups: disguises, which helps you sneak past the various monsters on each level, smiley faces, which increases your character's health, Scooby Snacks, including a counter telling you how many are needed to finish the level, and a Scooby Snacks Box, which appears after picking up enough Scooby Snacks, allowing you to successfully complete the level. Level bosses either contain classic Scooby villains, or the Phantom Virus; the villains must be defeated to complete the level, the Phantom Virus cannot be defeated until the final level, and must be avoided until you pick up the Scooby Snacks Box. Contact with monsters, villains and the Phantom Virus' electric bolts will reduce your character's health; if a character's health is gone, that character is captured in cyberspace, and another character will have to try the level.</p>\n<p>Points are earned for collecting Scooby Snacks, and evading the monsters. Clues are also collected during the game; the game saves via a password system, which records your collected clues, turns (remaining characters), and your score after each level. After finishing the final level, the game will ask you which of the four suspects in the game was responsible for unleashing the Phantom Virus. You win the game if you correctly identify the suspect who released the Phantom Virus based on the clues you've collected during the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: Battle Nexus</em> is based on the 2003 television series in the Turtles franchise. Like the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/16667/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-2-battle-nexus/\">console game of the same name</a>, it is based on the events of season two of the series. It however adapts fewer storylines and presents them in unique side-scrolling gameplay.</p>\n<p>The story is based primarily on the first two story arcs of the TV season: <em>Turtles in Space</em> and <em>Secret Origins</em>. The turtles are surrounded by a strange light and find themselves on a strange alien planet. After they rescue a robot who is hunted by soldiers and Triceratons, he tells them that he can help them get back home via the teleporter he built. Required for the vast distances however is the power of special crystals, so the four reptile dudes set out to collect them.</p>\n<p>The game consists of five worlds of six levels each. Each world contains 100 crystals. Finishing a world and unlocking the next requires beating all levels and, depending on difficulty, collecting all (hard), 85 (medium) or no (easy) crystals. Before each level, players can select which of the four turtles to play, and any level can be played again with another character to try and find more crystals. The levels themselves are of one of four different gameplay types. The majority take the form of a platformer with beat'em up elements. Due to interference by the Shredder and Baxter Stockman, the turtles' weapons materialize some distance away from them, so the first order in the platform levels is to collect the current character's signature weapon. Enemies stand in the way and can be taken out or avoided by hiding in doorways. To get around, the turtles can climb poles and ledges and pull themselves up shafts. Taking out enemies may reveal keycards, which are needed to open certain doors. The crystals can be in plain sight or hidden in blocks that must be destroyed first. The four characters have different abilities, and some crystals can only be reached by a specific turtle. For example, only Donatello can enter dark rooms because he wears sensor goggles and only Raphael can scale walls with his sais. Several of the platform levels end with boss fights.</p>\n<p>Next to the platform levels, there are three different kind of shooting levels. The hoverboard levels put one of the turtles on a hoverboard. The level scrolls automatically and enemies arrive from front and behind and can be shot at in both directions. The board can only stay airborne for a short time and will slowly glide downwards. It is slightly different with the hovercraft levels, which are similar to traditional arcade shoot'em ups. They also scroll automatically, and the craft can employ forward-firing lasers or a falling bomb to take out enemies. Both side-scrolling shooter level types occasionally end with boss battles. The final type of level takes place in space, with the action seen from a cockpit perspective. Lasers must be fired at enemy spacecraft, asteroids (to prevent collisions) and crystals (to pick them up).</p>\n<p>Besides the main story mode, the game also includes two smaller modes which can be played solo or in multiplayer via link cable. Race mode has the four turtles racing each other on hoverboards. Crouching above certain areas gives a speed boost or lets one knock the other turtles off their board for a time. In battle mode, the goal is to collect a number of crystals in a small level within a time limit, with enemies also standing in the way. Beating a level ups the crystal threshold for another player. Both extra modes feature a number of levels that are unlocked in succession.</p>",

The two will however only help SpongeBob if he runs several errands for them first, like getting them a meal or a facial treatment.</p>\n<p>The game is a traditional side-scrolling platformer consisting of five worlds of four levels each. In every level, the goal is to collect one particular ingredient for fulfilling the latest errand. Swimming or lying in SpongeBob's way are various hostile sea creatures he can dispatch with a slap from his giant red glove. In addition, he can pick up several items that allow more options, like several different weapons, including a fishing net, a coral blower and a jelly gun - all can be used to collect ammunition in the form of jellyfish or coral which can then be fired. A balloon allows SpongeBob to glide. A beating heart shows SpongeBob's health - should it get too low, he can refill it by picking up fast food items like milkshakes, fries and burgers. He can also collect spatulas - picking up 50 of them awards an extra life. Extra lives can also be found in the form of an extra pair of underpants.</p>\n<p>Every world ends with a boss battle. One level takes place in Sandy Cheeks' home tree. There, SpongeBob must periodically refresh himself at a water puddle or dry out and lose a life.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2</em> features eleven boxers. Eight boxers (Afro Thunder, Lulu Valentine, \"Raging\" Rivera, Jet \"Iron\" Chin, Mama Tua, Johnny Blood, Robox Rese 4, and Joey T.) are available from the start and three more are unlockable as additional boxers (two of them being real life celebrities).</p>\n<p>Arcade mode lets the player jump in the ring straight away and lets them box their way through several matches. Survival mode is similar to the Arcade mode, except the player's health isn't restored from the previous match so it becomes a test of endurance.</p>\n<p>The Championship mode is the most in depth mode for this game. It lets the player take their boxer from the start of their career to their final championship match. Between matches, the player has to train their boxer. Training involves exercise mini-games like weightlifting, using the speed bag, and heavy bag. Depending on how the player performs at these tasks will effect how much stats like their boxer's stamina, speed, and power will increase.</p>\n<p>Before a fight, boxers are introduced in the boxing ring by announcer <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/97653/michael-buffer/\">Michael Buffer</a>. During a fight, each boxer has two meters they have to pay attention to. One meter measures their health and the other measures their stamina. A boxer losing all of their health will get knocked down. The stamina meter measures how strong a punch is thrown. It will drain each time a boxer throws a punch and will slowly refill while not throwing punches, so it's better to throw punches to land with as much power as possible then to throw punches wildly as they will lose their potency as the boxer starts tiring. Taunting an opponent will earn a boxer letters that will eventually spell out the word \"Rumble\". Once the word is filled out, the player can unleash a flurry of punches on their opponent which doesn't cost their boxer any of their stamina for a limited amount of time.</p>\n<p>After a match, the fight stats are shown and list things like the number of punches thrown and punches landed, punch accuracy, and the total number of knockdowns given to the opponent.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Midway's arcade hockey series makes its only appearance on the Game Boy Advance with <em>NHL Hitz 20-03</em>. Adhering to the arcade style, matches are three-on-three (plus goalies), there are hardly any penalties and fights happen regularly.</p>\n<p>Game modes include exhibition games, a full season (of 29, 58 or 82 games) and playoffs (best of 1, 3, 5 or 7). Season progress is stored to battery-backed RAM. A multiplayer mode via link cable for up to four players is also available. Before a match, players select their lineup from the star players of the included NHL teams.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is seen from an elevated horizontally scrolling view. Controls allow for stick and body checks and dekes. As is standard in Midway arcade sports games, each player has a turbo meter that allows the toggling of turbo, which enhances the other moves. Additionally, players can \"catch on fire\" after a hat trick or a sequence of successful checks, which increases their abilities for a short time.</p>\n<p>The game features voice sample commentary from long-time Midway announcer Tim Kitzrow.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Salt Lake 2002</em> is the officially licensed game of the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. The Game Boy Advance version has its own selection of disciplines compared to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5639/salt-lake-2002/\">console version</a>, with graphics and controls customized for the handheld.</p>\n<p>Six different disciplines are available: Ski Jumping, Curling, Downhill Skiing, Bobsleigh, Snowboarding and Downhill Slalom.\nDifferent competitions are available: in Tournament Mode, players select one event and compete through four rounds, trying to best the feats of an (unseen) opponent. Olympic Mode is a competition for medals, through one or more events. Getting gold requires exceeding a certain score. Classic Mode consists of all six events in order. All target scores must be met/won in order to unlock higher difficulty levels for the other modes, with three lives available. There is also a time trial/ghost mode, in which players can try to beat their previous records. There is also a multiplayer mode for up to four players, taking turns on the same GBA.</p>\n<p>Each discipline has its own perspective and controls: jumping requires keeping balance by keeping a red dot in a targeting reticle and then pushing a button for a good landing. Downhill, slalom and snowboard are all similar, seen from an overhead perspective and allowing the athlete to crouch for acceleration, break, and make hard turns. Acceleration for the bobsleigh is done from a side view, with the actual run then seen from an elevated view behind the bob, with a dot indicating the optimum position on the track. Curling is seen from a side view, with players controlling both the throw as well as the sweepers.</p>",

Compared to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9635/mlb-slugfest-20-04/\">console version</a>, it has a reduced number of gameplay modes and options and features traditional two-dimensional graphics.</p>\n<p>Gameplay modes include Quick Play for a single exhibition match, Challenge (similar to a season, with one game against every team) and Series (best-of-7 World Series match). Progress in Challenge and Series modes is saved via passwords. The game includes licensed teams and players from the 2003 MLB season, along with six different ballparks.</p>\n<p>Gameplay largely follows the traditional model: pitching and batting are seen from a view behind the batter, while the view switches to an isometric view of the field once the ball is away. The standard features of Midway's sports games can also be found here: players have a turbo meter that can be used to enhance their moves, and they can catch on fire after several successful plays, enhancing their abilities even further.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Acclaim's baseball series makes its debut on the Game Boy Advance with <em>All-Star Baseball 2003</em>. It has fewer modes and features than the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6419/all-star-baseball-2003/\">console version</a> and is presented in 2D graphics adapted to the platform.</p>\n<p>Game modes include Quick Game (random match-up), Exhibition, All-Star Game, Batting Practice, Home Run Derby, Season (8 different length and mode combinations) and World Series. There is also a two-player mode via link cable.</p>\n<p>Gameplay follows the traditional model. Players control pitching, batting and fielding. For pitching and batting, the view is from behind the batter. Batting involves moving a triangular cursor to aim the bat and pushing a button for swinging or bunting. The triangular cursor can be turned off for an attempt at a power swing, which is harder to hit but almost guarantees a home run. The pitcher selects the type of pitch from a menu. During fielding, the game switches to an overhead view of the field, realized through a Mode-7-style sprite/background layer engine. The ball's landing place and running lines are indicated through a red marker and yellow lines, respectively. The camera moves and zooms automatically to focus on the action.</p>\n<p>Like the console version, the GBA title has a trading card feature. Cards are gained by winning games in many of the modes and can be traded with another player via link cable.</p>",

Pitchers can either throw a fastball or select from a variety of special throws on a pitching cursor. Which pitches are available depends on the athlete's skill set. Batting works without aiming and simply requires correct timing when swinging or bunting. Fielding is done on an isometric view of the field. Advanced playing techniques like picking off players, stealing bases, hit-and-runs or beaning are not possible.</p>",

Season progress is again saved to battery-backed RAM. Multiplayer has been added with two-player matchups via link cable. Teams, players and stats have been updated for the new MLB season.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is also largely unchanged. Batting and pitching are again done from a view behind the batter, but with the batter now rendered in real-time via polygons. The pitching interface via the pitching cursor is unchanged, as are the isometric field graphics. Some advanced playing techniques have been added: it is now possible to steal bases and throw bean balls.</p>",

It offers a selection of teams and modes from the concurrent <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8352/fifa-soccer-2003/\">console version</a>, with simpler controls and traditional two-dimensional graphics.</p>\n<p>The game includes 14 leagues (the same as in the console version minus the Brazilian league), including English Premier League, German Bundesliga, Spanish Primera Divisi\u00f3n, Italian Serie A and North American Major League Soccer. In addition, there are 16 teams from the rest of the world (down from 40 in the console version) and 40 international teams. There is a license for real player names, with leagues and rosters based on the 2002-2003 season.</p>\n<p>The teams can be used in friendly matches, two-player games via link cable and a number of competitions. These include league play for all of the included leagues, Club Championship (a league of the top 18 European clubs), EFA Trophy (akin to the real-world UEFA Cup, but without license) and European Champions Cup (akin to real-world UEFA Champions League, but without license). Competition progress is stored to battery-backed RAM, with two slots available.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is seen from an angled overhead view parallel to the sidelines. Controls allow for lobs, kicks and passes on the offensive, and conservative and hard tackles on defense, with a sprint toggle also available. Selectable options include various skill levels (separately for team and goalkeeper), extra time (with Golden Goal option), as well as weather and wind conditions.</p>",

The number of teams from the rest of the world has increased to 24, while the number of international teams has decreased to 37.</p>\n<p>Game modes still include friendlies, two-player link cable play, and several competitions. There is league play for all included leagues, the returning EFA Trophy and European Champions Cup (UEFA Cup and UEFA Champions League without license, respectively) and three new additions: Americas Club Championship (pitting North, Central and South American clubs against each other), and International Cup (akin to the real-life World Cup) and a Ladder Tournament. The three new competitions must be unlocked however by connecting to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10895/fifa-soccer-2004/\">the GameCube version of the game</a>.</p>\n<p>Actual gameplay has changed ony little: the same overhead, two-way scrolling perspective is used as are the same controls.</p>",

It comes with many changes compared to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/79056/fifa-soccer-2004/\">its predecessor</a>, with new modes, more teams, new control options and a new graphics engine.</p>\n<p>All included leagues from the predecessor return, with several additions: Brazil and Mexico, plus lower-tier leagues from England, Germany, France, Italy and Spain. There are 12 \"rest of the world\" teams as well as 39 international teams.</p>\n<p>Returning game modes are friendlies, link cable multiplayer, league play, and several tournaments: Americas Club Championship, International Cup and Ladder Tournament. Newly added competitions are the national cups of 16 of the included leagues. Making its first appearance on the GBA (after having been part of the console versions since <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10895/fifa-soccer-2004/\">FIFA 2004</a>) is the career mode: in this mode, players take control of a single club for up to five seasons, taking the club to national and international heights. Each season has its own goals that must be met. Meeting certain conditions in games played awards manager prestige points, which result in a star rating which will improve the squad's performance.</p>\n<p>An exclusive feature not seen in the console versions are the challenges. There are comeback challenges and rout challenges, each presenting a certain situation from a real game, asking the player to recreate or improve upon the real results. Playing through all pre-set challenges unlocks the custom challenge editor, which allows the player to create any situation.</p>\n<p>The game employs a new 3D graphics engine that allows for variable camera perspectives. During normal gameplay, an overhead view similar to those of the previous games is maintained, but there is a choice of three different zoom levels. Penalties, corner kicks and instant replays place the camera in appropriate spots.</p>\n<p>Controls have become more complex with the addition of the left shoulder button as a modifier, which allows for through ball and 1-2 pass plays on offense and last man back and goalkeeper charges on defense.</p>",

Grim's chest was tampered with and Mojo Balls were released into the universe. These Mojo Balls infect everyone they touch with supernatural rage. So Grim, Billy and Mandy have to go out and retrieve them all to prevent the universe to fall into eternal chaos.</p>\n<p>The game's Story mode is a side-scrolling platformer/brawler, which alternates between small platforming sections and stopping to have the player battle a certain amount of enemies, all of which have to be defeated before the level can move on. To accomplish this the player has kick and punch attacks as well as an air attack and a special attack which can be launched once the power bar is full. It is filled by defeating enemies. There is also a double jump and a butt bounce action, which help to get through the platforming sections.</p>\n<p>At the end of each character's story is a boss, whose defeat awards the player with one Mojo Ball. The Mojo Balls are needed to unlock the extra characters. Initially only Billy is available, then Mandy, and last Grim. To unlock Mandy Billy's Story must be completed and a certain amount of Mojo Balls collected. Most of the Mojo Balls come from Mission mode, which plays essentially the same, but in very short levels, many of which have time limits and play like mini-games.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ice Nine</em> is a first person shooter where player assumes a role of newly-enlisted CIA operative. The game starts at Langley with a series of training missions: target practice and live exercise with marker pellets instead of real bullets, where you need to mark your fellow operatives in a real urban area. However that training ends on a sour note as you learn that one of your colleagues could possibly be a mole that tries to leak and sell a deadly computer virus called Ice Nine. Since there's no hard proof it becomes your new mission to infiltrate CIA and find it - not without help from your chief.</p>\n<p>The game is using 3D-engine similar to <em>Doom</em> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=dark+forces\">Dark Forces</a> - it can display some simple texture mapped 3D architecture, has variable level height, ladders, elevators, but the characters are sprite-based and there's no free look. Many objects on levels could be destroyed or at least damaged. The game is majorly run'n'gun exercise where doors are opened automatically to not slow down the action and most of the goals include finding keys or objects and eliminating all of the opposition, however in several missions the CIA agent must avoid security cameras and use night vision to move in the dark.</p>\n<p>There are 18 missions, but some of the locations are reused throughout the game. <em>Ice Nine</em> arsenal offers a standard FPS set that has everything from a handgun to rocket launcher, also there's a sniper rifle that can be used with a zoom feature.</p>",

You begin the game by selecting one of several Kids to control, each with their own name and appearance. The goal is to reach the end of several sets of platforming levels &amp; talk to the friend or puppy at the end. The gameplay is simple and there is no way to die or take damage, though there are occasional enemies who will knock you back if you touch them. There are also three minigames to play through in-between stages. After beating all the stages, you can revisit each level to collect all the gems and try for a 100% file.</p>",

The game features platforming levels where the player will play as the Apatosaurus Littlefoot, the Pteranodon Petrie, or the Saurolophus Ducky, as well as levels with a top down perspective where they take control of the Triceratops Cera or the Stegosaurus Spike. Each character has a different level type, with Littlefoot's focused on normal platforming, Petrie's on flight, Ducky's on swimming, Cera's on breaking boulders in her path, and Spike on navigating mazes. There are some special levels where all the dinosaurs may ride together on a leaf sled or a raft, and the final level has a greater combat focus as the player controls Littlefoot's grandfather.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Wankuru</em> is a falling-block puzzle game that plays similarly to Sega's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/2342/baku-baku-animal/\">Baku Baku Animal</a>. Players drop pairs of puzzle blocks, which can be dogs, doghouses, or a mix of the two. The goal is to place long chains of dogs of the same colour, then place a doghouse of the same colour next to them so the whole chain can go home. Like other puzzle games, creating long chain reactions produces a major point reward. Like in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/2464/puyo-puyo-games/\">Puyo Puyo series</a>, chain reactions rain garbage blocks down on the opponent's playfield; in this game, the garbage blocks are bones, and any dog eating a bone will refuse to enter a doghouse until they finish.</p>\n<p>Similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/115867/wankuru/\">earlier Windows version</a>, there are both single-player and multiplayer modes. The main single-player game is a story mode which features some short visual novel-style scenes in between matches against the CPU. In this version the player is able to customize both their protagonist and their dog. The player can pick and name a female or male protagonist, and can also choose from one of a large number of dog breeds to name and customize. There is also a score attack mode, in which the player tries to get as far as possible through a set of 100 levels while racking up points. There is also a two-player mode which uses the Game Boy Advance's link cable.</p>",

Each character is tied to a different minigame: Topaz has \"Watch the Hair\", in which she shrinks down and climbs through her friends' hair to untangle knots while dodging frizzies and Snarf; Sapphire has Smarty Trollz, a memory-matching game; Ruby has Trollz Dance, a rhythm game; Amethyst has Flying Spell, an aerial sidescroller that also involves shooting enemies while managing the skoot's energy; and Onyx has Spell Beadz, a Puzzle Bobble clone. Each minigame also features collectible power-ups, with each one doing something different depending on the game. The gameplay is affected by the difficulty setting chosen at the beginning of the game (easy, medium, or hard).In the story mode, these minigames are played in between short cutscenes.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Power Pro-kun Pocket 4</em> is a 2002 arcade Baseball simulator developed by Diamond Head and published by Konami for the Game Boy Advance. </p>\n<p>The game's main feature is its Success story scenario, \"Sunrise Highschool Edition\", which follows a boy who is inflicted with a deadly curse after accidentally knocking over a memorial headstone. His friends start vanishing and his Baseball club is set ablaze. If he does not rebuild the club and win the Koshien tournament in three years, even he will be dragged into a vortex of oblivion.</p>\n<p>The player must manage the protagonist's weekly routine to train, recruit new teammates, fix the Baseball club and date one out of a few love interests. Failing the story's objectives or losing any late-game matches results in a game over which erases the player's save file. It is possible to reset the game to prevent that, but there are restrictions and penalties for doing so.</p>\n<p>Clearing the first scenario 3 times reveals the Inner Success, which is called \"RPG-Style Fantasy\". It follows a warrior in a fantasy world who must face various monstrous threats while looking for powerups and mystical spheres to build a Baseball Doll for a king. From this installment on, various characters from previous games are adapted into these alternate universes.</p>\n<p>As suggested by the title, this mode features turn-based battles and random encounters. Allies can be found around the world and recruited, but will be lost if killed in combat or from other circumstances. The same inventory system from <em>Pawapoke 3</em> is used to manage powerups for the player character and his custom Baseball Doll. And although the player is under a limit of 200 actions to clear the story with, rushing through the mission can result in various events being lost, including the final boss.</p>\n<p>Upon clearing either Success mode, the player can use the resulting character to build a custom team for playing Baseball on the Exhibition mode. Much of the game's replayability comes from attempting to earn the best possible ballplayers with strategy and luck. Matches between two people who own the game and a link cable are supported, and players can also share their characters via long passwords.</p>",

It adapts the film in the form of a beat'em up/brawler seen from an isometric perspective. The player controls the Fantastic Four (usually only two, but sometimes all four at the same time) and can switch between them at will, with each of the heroes having different attacks they use to fight minions and boss enemies. The Four also have distinct special abilities that are utilized for slight puzzle elements, with a color-coded prompt usually indicating which hero's power is necessary to overcome an obstacle. Besides Dr. Doom (the main villain of the film), the game includes additional storylines featuring other villains from the comics.</p>",

Assuming the role of one of the main characters from the represented franchises, players are instructed by Jimmy Neutron to head to the worlds of the Nicktoons and use a specially designed camera to return characters to their home dimensions while also finding and defeating the robot doppelgangers. </p>\n<p>Players are able to move their chosen character around a set walking area to avoid hazards and get better angles for their free-moving camera cursor. Taking pictures of objects in the environment can reveal characters, and many characters require repeated snapshots to perform actions or return to their home dimension. Each level has a score threshold that needs to be beaten by taking pictures of characters and interesting sights, with many smaller side objectives like photographing a specific interaction between characters providing point bonuses if they're completed. Boss fights also cap off each world where players must survive attacks and snap three good shots of the robot duplicates.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the film of the same name, The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause sees players controlling Scott Calvin in a platforming game that follows the movies events. Beginning as him firmly in his role as Santa Claus, early levels are devoted to exploring icy levels at the North Pole, collecting cookies and milk while avoiding hazards like spiky ice and enemies. Players only need to reach the end of the levels to complete them, the game capping off most of its chapters with minigames like elves navigating a haywire workshop to build a scooter or playing as Santa flying his sleigh to deliver coal and presents to the appropriate households.</p>\n<p>Villain Jack Frost aims to sabotage Santa's Christmas activities so he can steal the mantle of the legendary holiday figure for himself, leading to Scott Calvin having to navigate a few levels without his Christmas powers. Normally Santa can glide with his coat and attack with a jack-in-the-box, but Scott relies only on thrown snowballs to repel baddies and the double jump both he and Santa share for level navigation. Some levels will change away from the lax pace of free level exploration to add automatically scrolling screens to pressure players into fast movement.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Rocky</em> is a boxing game that was inspired by the first five Rocky movies.</p>\n<p>The main mode is called Movie mode which follows Rocky's career from small-time boxer to champ. There are 20 opponents from the movie for Rocky to fight. Beating certain boxers will unlock cutscenes inspired by the movies and is basically the games narrative moments.</p>\n<p>In this mode Rocky has to train before each match so his skills can improve. Training increases Rocky's strength, speed, stamina, and defense statistics. Training includes sparring with a padded trainer, hitting the heavy bag, or punching the speed bag. These activities can be done manually or automatically as the player so chooses. When in the ring Rocky can throw left and right punches, do combos, and can dodge punches.</p>\n<p>Other modes include Exhibition mode, Knockout mode, and a 2 player Versus Mode. In exhibition mode players can fight any boxer they unlocked from the Movie mode and they also have the option to select the venue, the round length, the number of rounds, and the computer's difficulty level. Knockout mode is unlocked only after Movie mode is completed. It is basically a survival mode in which the player selects a series of fighters against whom to compete for belts in a tournament.</p>",

        "description": "<p>After numerous conflicts around Earth, peace has finally come, if only temporarily. A race of extraterrestrials, Barm (\u30d0\u30fc\u30e0, from the animated series <em>T\u014dsh\u014d Daimos</em>), escaping their dying home planet, come to the Earth Orbit as refugees. While initially the Earth Federation was willing to accept them into the Space Colonies, the assassination of the diplomatic mission results in the war with the extraterrestrials. Meanwhile, an empire on the Moon declares independence and assaults the Federation, and the Mars Colony goes missing after an attack by an unknown enemy. On Earth, monsters of Dr. Hell (<em>Mazinger Z</em>) start rampaging through again. The only saving grace for the Federation is the 13th Independent Battalion, Londo Bell (from <em>Char's Counterattack</em>). However, none of the members of the team really know who sowed the seeds of war. The battalion bands together to find out.</p>\n<p>This is the first game in the <em>Super Robot Wars/Taisen</em> franchise released for the Game Boy Advance. Graphics-wise, the game shares many similarities with the games in the Classic timeline, especially <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/44831/super-robot-wars-f/\">F</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/44832/super-robot-wars-f-final/\">F Final</a></em>. Units in combat do not have battle animations and they are drawn in the \"super-deformed\" style. In terms of gameplay, the game is a classic tactical RPG with many Japanese robot franchises. Unlike the previous entries in the series, the game introduces a loyalty system, where units that assist other units by way of support attack or defense can increase their damage or defense rate every time they do it. Also, defensive items such as shields now have their own separate HP bar.</p>\n<p>Like other SRW games starting from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/44831/super-robot-wars-f/\">F</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/44832/super-robot-wars-f-final/\">F Final</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/67374/super-robot-taisen-\u03b1/\">Alpha</a>, players are given the option of choosing their main character and their robot type. Depending on the choice of the type of robot or choices made by the player character mid-game, the story can branch out in different directions. During intermissions, players can customize pilot skills and upgrade their current robot roster.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Butt-Ugly Martians: B.K.M. Battles</em> is a side-scrolling shoot'em up game based on the cartoon of the same name. The Martian Emperor Bog has grown tired of his inefficient Earth-invaders-turned-Earth-protectors envoys and had dispatched an army of evil aliens to finally take over the Earth. The three Butt-Ugly Martians must stop him.</p>\n<p>The player can pick their favorite Martian out of B-Bop A-Luna, 2T Fru-T, or Do-Wah Diddy, each with a different mix of attack, defense, and speed abilities. All of them are in \"butt-kicking mode\" (B.K.M.), meaning they don their powerful assault suit. </p>\n<p>On each level, the player is tasked with destroying aliens and unlocking doors by finding the correct keys to reach the end of the space cavern where a boss enemy will be waiting for them. Various power-ups can be picked up to increase the abilities of the playable characters: extra fire power, extra armor, temporary invincibility, turbo, etc. </p>\n<p>Occasionally, the player will be confronted by Stoat Muldoon, an alien hunter and long-time antagonist of the Butt-Ugly Martians, who can be defeated by simply collecting a memory erasing crystal and using it against him. The game contains a total of 28 levels spread over 7 worlds. There are three difficulty levels and progress is saved using a password system. </p>\n<p>Butt-Ugly Martians: B.K.M. Battles also features Gamecube connectivity with the game Butt Ugly Martians: Zoom or Doom in which special content can be unlocked by collecting five colored gems in the Game Boy Advance game.</p>",

Due to the game now appearing on a handheld device some sacrifices were made. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 23 levels of the PlayStation version were reduced to only 12. This removed the factory levels where Pac-Man rescues Pac Jr. and this reduction in levels also causes the majority of the boss fights to be removed too.</li>\n<li>The Maze Mode and Classic Mode of the PlayStation version are not present here.</li>\n<li>The story told through FMV cutscenes of the PlayStation version are now just still images with text. Since the FMV's were removed the bonus outtake FMV's that were rewarded for players who collected all the P-A-C-M-A-N letters are not here with collecting the letters now simply counting to the completion percentage of the game.</li>\n<li>No hub worlds at all unlike the PlayStation version which had them.</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p>This GBA release is different from the main console version <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/11247/all-star-baseball-2004/\">All-Star Baseball 2004</a> for some game elements. This portable version offers both single-player and multiplayer modes with a full license for all 30 MLB teams, stadiums and more than 800 players. Game modes include Exhibition, Season, All-star game, Home run derby, Playoffs and World series. There is no Franchise mode. Multiplayer against a second player is supported through a link cable. Through the battery back-up, progress in the season, a collection of 250 trading cards that can be earned, player trades and roster changes are stored.</p>\n<p>During the batting phase the swing is aimed using a large triangle indicator. The direction of the hit is then determined by rotating and tilting the triangle. A similar mechanic is used for pitching during defense. During field a base is chosen using the directional pad and optionally the CPU can take over to do this automatically. The AI behavior of computer-controlled players is quite different compared to the main console version. At any moment it is possible to make substitions or adjust the position of the field players.</p>\n<p>A new feature compared to the 2003 version is the ability for CPU pitchers to throw outside the strike zone. The increase in the base runners' speed now also allows them to do doubles or triples. There are more animations for the players, for instance the pitcher follow-throughs and the batter walk-ups. There is more visual details as well, such as a scoreboard celebrations and typical stadium details such as waving flags. Audio-wise, play-by-play commentary is a new feature for this year's version.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Backyard Baseball 2006</em> is an entry in the <em>Backyard Sports</em> series and the second <em>Baseball</em> title in the series to be released for the GBA, following <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/193967/backyard-baseball/\">Backyard Baseball</a> in 2002. The game uses cartoon-like visuals and carries an MLB license presenting famous players from 30 professional teams as kid versions, with 55 neighborhood kid characters in addition. Matches take place in famous stadiums, but also in backyards. The main game modes are Pick-up Game, Season Play, Mini Games and Link Play.</p>\n<p>In Season Play a team can be taken through a season of 16 or 32 games. Typical baseball rules are followed, but there are new elements such as the ability to earn power-ups by fulfilling certain requirements, by hitting a homerun or throwing a crazy pitch. A fireball then offers an automatic strike for instance and a metal bat turns a hit into a homerun all the time. Several fields, abilities and players are unlocked gradually through the game modes and through specific actions, such as tagging out a runner, or making a double or triple play. The Mini-games mode offers challenges based around fielding and homeruns.</p>\n<p>Compared to the first version there are improved visuals with tweaks to the gameplay. Fields are more colourful and a red target now shows where the ball will land during the fielding. There is a large amount of customization for the games, player uniforms, abilities and options such as toggling pitch locators or player stamina. There are three difficulty levels: Rookie, Pro and Allstar.</p>",

A number of skaters gathers to raise funds to turn their backyard into a real skatepark. They participate in the Backyard Skate Tour where they help out people in the neighbourhood to earn stamps in their tour book. They start at Mom 'N' Pop's Skateshop and by earning enough stamps they can move on to another shop. Every location also has a kid acting as a boss, offering a challenge. When defeated, the kid the joins the group as a new playable character. As each kid also brings a sponsor, at the end of the game their will be enough funds to build the ultimate park Skate Station Alpha.</p>\n<p>The game is different from the earlier <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Backyard+Skateboarding\">PC version</a> and uses a bird's-eye view. There are different skaters available that can be customized. Each skater has different statistics based on air, balance, flip, speed and spin. The skater is controlled directly in a scrolling environment that can be explored freely in any direction. Every location has characters with tasks or challenges to complete to earn the stamps. Tasks for instance include delivering newspapers against a time limit. The main score is shown in the top left corner as \"juice\". Skaters can move, jump and perform tricks. Often parts of the environments can be used for grinds and jumps using ramps.</p>\n<p>The game includes a multiplayer mode.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Fear Factor: Unleashed</em> is a game based on the US stunt/dare TV game show <em>Fear Factor</em> that initially ran on NBC from 2001 to 2006. The shows pits contestants against each other in a variety of stunts for a grand prize. In this adaptation a character is created at the start with minor customizability options (hair colour, skin tone and costume colour) and twenty skill points to distribute over four statistics that influence the performance: nerve, stamina, steadiness and stomach. A random type of fear is also assigned to the characters, such as acrophobia, claustrophobia, herpetophobia, tachophobia etc. The character then gets to compete in twelve mini-games based around stunts.</p>\n<p>The main game modes are Custom, Fear Factor, Multiplayer and Practice. Each game starts with a brief explanation of the stunt and the controls that are used. One example is The Pit and the Pendulum. In a fixed screen environment shown from a side view a character is tied up near the bottom of the screen while a swinging axe descends slowly. The player needs to balance a fear meter to keep it steady while opening a lock by moving a shaft and locking barrels. In single-player the character competes against five other contestants who each get their turn with a time to beat. In another challenge, Gross Out Buffet, the character needs to gobble down Madagascar cockroaches. Examples of other challenges are Creepy Conveyor Belt (move maggots between conveyor belts using your mouth), Helicopter Havoc (use ropes to jump between helicopters in flight) and Runaway Train (obstacle course on top of a moving train). The fear meter is a returning element in each mini-game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Battle B-Daman: Fire Spirits!</em> is an action game based on the anime TV series of the same name, which is in turn based on the B-Daman line of toys. It is a follow-up to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/153697/battle-b-daman/\">Battle B-Daman</a> game released in the same year. The game is mainly about one-to-one battles between two robots interspersed with some story elements. By winning matches new parts become available offering customization options. The battles are played from a first-person perspective where the robot can only be moved left or right, firing coloured plastic balls to damage the opponent and avoiding the incoming attacks.</p>\n<p>The story revolves around the character Yamato Delgado who, after becoming a B-Dachampion, now enters the Winners Tournament. Most of the game he is in search of Strike Shots that will help him ensure victories. It initially follows the story of the early anime episodes, but then changes introducing a new antagonist called Death Poker Alliance. They are after the Petrified Parts Yamato is looking for.</p>\n<p>The game contains a main Adventure mode focusing on the store as well as a Battle mode. There are also six mini-games: Battle Shoot, Gate Check, Puzzle Wall, Snipe Shoot, Target Bug and Target Hit.</p>\n<p>There are many strategic elements during the battles based on different special and charged attacks. The Zero System concept of the original game is replaced with the Blaster Core System. It allows for the customization of special moves by equipping a specific core.</p>",

The winner of the competition will then receive the grand prize: A pair of go-go boots studded with several diamonds.</p>\n<p>The girls use the truck to travel between locations and it can be customized with different designs and colors. The driving is a short mini-game shown from a behind view where heart-shaped items called 'blingz' are collected while a timer counts down. In the location the girls arrive at there are short story sequences and different types of activities need to be completed such as finding an assistant, assisting the people with tasks or buying and items using the 'blingz' currency. In these sections the girls are controlled directly in turns with a scrolling bird's-eye view.</p>\n<p>More currency is earned through short mini-games such as a game of volleyball, collecting blingz while rollerskating against a time limit, designing a flyer or participating in a dance competition. There is an overview of all objectives that need to be completed. It is possible to talk to most of the characters. Once everything is done, the girls drive to a new location where a new set of objectives needs to be completed.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Blades of Thunder</em> is a 3D action game about controlling a helicopter during military missions. The story revolves around defeating a terrorist organization called The Solar Martyrs targetting oil refineries in the Middle East. During gameplay the helicopter is shown using a behind view. It has a pseudo 3D environment and it is one of the first games to employ voxel technology on the GBA. The helicopter can be steered freely combining strafing with changing the altitude for evasive manoeuvrers. There are separate controls to move the crosshairs. The main action usually revolves around taking out units in the air, on the ground or at sea, but there are also escorting tasks or protecting allied vehicles and buildings.</p>\n<p>Three types of environments are used with snowy areas, deserts and a generic European setting. In the bottom right a radar shows enemy units. Enemies also use radars as vehicles and these can be taken out to draw less attention. Other parts of the hud display remaining lives, the amount of health, the remaining ammo for the unguided Hydra rockets and lock-on Homing Missiles (the regular machine gun has infinite ammo) and the total score. Later levels introduce power-ups to provide additional damage or the ability to fire multiple rockets in one shot. Health and ammo are replenished by flying over pick-up stations.</p>\n<p>There are ten levels with primary and secondary objectives and each one starts with a short briefing. There are also bosses to defeat. There are three difficulty levels and a password system is used. At the end of a mission a total mission score is calculated based on the amount of units destroyed, the amount of secondary objectives completed and bonuses.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Babar To The Rescue</em> is a game based around Babar the Elephant, a character from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Jean+de+Brunhoff\">Jean de Brunhoff's</a> children's books. It consists of a series of nine levels played in a fixed order. There are three types of gameplay and these are repeated with some variations. The included levels are:* Balloon Ride: control Babar in a hot air balloon in a 2D side-scrolling environment. Collect crowns and avoid obstacles and enemies to make it to the children.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Across the Rivers: a side-scrolling platform game where Babar needs to make it past water sections, using platforms, swinging with vines and collecting crowns.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jungle Rally: a top-down, vertically scrolling racing game where Babar needs to collect crows and avoid obstacles. There are also ramps that can be used. The car is steered and can be sped up or down.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Savannah: similar to Across the Rivers but now in a savannah that is on fire.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Down the River: similar to Jungle Rally but now on a river controlling a speedboat.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the Snow: similar to Across the Rivers and The Savannah, but now in a frozen environment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Motorcycle Rally: similar to the previous two racing sections, but now on a motorcycle.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Off to the Island: the platforming mini-game, but with a new setting and with the ability to swim and explore underwater. Babar needs to go back to the surface regularly to fill his oxygen meters or his points are drained.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Going Home: a variation of the first Balloon Ride level as Babar needs to get back home.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are short story sequences between levels shown as static images and overall progresses through the levels is shown on a map. The game emphasizes the score a lot and keeps track of the highscore.</p>",

In this adaptation of the animated TV series Aang and his friends investigate the disappearance of the Waterbender Hiryu and discover it has been happening regularly.</p>\n<p>Controlling only Aang at the start, a group of three characters is soon formed with Katara and Sokka joining. The group moves together and the player can switch between them at any moment to take control of a specific one. It is mainly played as an action game, exploring the environment, dodging hazards and fighting enemies using a bird's-eye view, but there is also a strong element of environment based puzzle-solving.</p>\n<p>Characters can push boxes to manipulate the environment and they each have different abilities. Aang can use a high jump to reach high ledges, Sokka can activate switches using a boomerang and Katara can construct bridges. Characters have a health meter as well as a stamina meter that is drained when performing actions and then quickly refills again.</p>",

The game is set in Barbie's high school where valuable items for the high school charity auction have gone missing. By locating these Barbie cannot only help the school, but it will also help her land the TV anchor position currently held by Raquelle, a girl she does not like.</p>\n<p>The game is largely played as an adventure game where Barbie explores the environment, talks to characters and uses a large variety of tech tools to locate and inspect clues. All available tools are accessible through the BDA (Barbie Diary Assistant). Examples are an Infrared Viewer, an MP3 Decoder or a Picture Descrambler. There are nineteen locations in total to explore with a map that provides an overview. The clues are stored in a separate screen and there is also an overview of the current objectives. The sequences where the tech tools are used are also available as mini-games at the main menu.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Agent Hugo: RoboRumble</em> is an action game starring Hugo the troll, here part of the <em>Agent Hugo</em> science fiction reboot first introduced in 2005. Agent Hugo needs to take on Geekdorph who threatens the world. He is a scientist who inserted his own brain into a robot and he is now the lord of a robot army. Agent Hugo needs to infiltrate his robot factory using Tex 2000, a futuristic hoverboard.</p>\n<p>In 2D-sidescrolling levels Hugo moves at a fast speed and can move vertically between lanes to pick up items or avoid hazards. He is always on top of the hoverboard and he can shoot, jump and activate a shield device. Tricks can also be performed while in the air.</p>\n<p>A mission is completed when the end of the track is reached. The game keeps tracks of the completion time, the score based on item pick-ups and the number of kills. Lanes often have gaps that need to be avoided. There also jump pads and arrows that provide additional speed. The HUD shows the passed time, total score, current speed, track completion percentage and number of kills. A retry is provided for every death and a password is provided when a mission is completed.</p>",

Game options include a difficulty level selection, adjusting the amount of innings and a selection of different fields. Before the start of the game the batting order can be determined.</p>\n<p>During the batting phase a behind view is used when swinging with an orange circle that can be moved around green cross-hairs to strike at the right time. When pitching the same perspective is used with a red dot moved around the green cross-hairs, a separate bar for pitching power and four options for the pitch type. During field play the perspective shifts to a bird's-eye view.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Battle B-Daman</em> is a game based on the B-Daman marble shooting toy produced in Japan by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Takara\">Takara</a>, and more specifically the <em>Battle B-Daman</em> manga adaptation by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/1112508/eiji-inuki/\">Eiji Inuki</a>. The game follows Yamato Delgado who dreams of playing B-Daman, the traditional sports game of the B-Daworld. The goal is to battle various B-DaPlayers to compete in the Winner's Tournament. To get there he needs to find all parts of a Cobalt Blade.</p>\n<p>The game is mainly about one-to-one battles between two robots interspersed with some story elements. By winning matches new parts become available offering customization options. The battles are played from a first-person perspective where the robot can only be moved left or right, firing coloured plastic balls to damage the opponent and avoiding the incoming attacks. There are two ways to battle: Direct Hit Battle or B-Daman Invasion. A button is used to shoot while a B-DaSpirit gauge fills up gradually. When the D-Pad shape starts blinking along with red triangles and different directions, the B button can be pressed along with the direction of the red triangle to launch a Special Attack. These Special Attacks vary throughout the game based on the B-Daman customization and equipment.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This Hasbro board game compilation features the three board games of the same name. Based off the selection of those games, the compilation seems to be themed towards luck and young children, as a structurally similar compilation featuring \"The Game of Life,\" \"Pay Day,\" and \"Yahtzee\" themes to chance and economics. Each game gives the player the option to have each participant either be played by a person or the computer itself; the player can even make every player a computer player and watch the action in the chosen board game.</p>\n<p>\"Candy Land\" has participants try to navigate the location stated in the title to meet King Kandy. Two to four players can participate. Each space either is of a solid color, includes an icon corresponding to a location, can transport the player through shortcuts, or can hold him/her back from finishing the game. Movement is done by a deck of cards; the card drawn from the top by a player directs him/her to the next space to transport to. A solid-colored square card tells the player to move to the next space with that color; cards can have two squares, which have the player move to the second space of the same color in his/her path. Location cards have the player transport straight to the space corresponding to those cards. The first to make it to Candy Castle, where King Kandy is located, wins.</p>\n<p>\"Chutes &amp; Ladders\" involves spinning a six-space wheel to progress through the 10 x 10 space board. Once again, two to four players may play this game. Although many of the spaces numbered 1-100 have nothing happening, some are located at the ends of ladders and slides. If the player reaches the bottom of a ladder, he/she can climb it to the top; if the player reaches the top of a slide, he/she must slide down it to the bottom. Each ladder and slide represent certain scenarios, where ladders involve positive actions leading to positive consequences and slides involve negative actions leading to negative consequences. The first to reach space 100 wins the game.</p>\n<p>\"Original Memory Game\" plays the same as the card-matching game of concentration. This time, one to four players can play, and the number of cards can be chosen; either 20, 42, or 72 cards can be played on. The cards begin face down; the player chooses two cards to flip over. If the cards are the same, the cards are removed from the game and the player gains a point. With multiple players, if a player finds a match, he/she can keep taking turns until that player finds a pair of different cards. The goal is to have the most points if competing with other players, or to find all matches if playing independently.</p>",

Each time a game is selected, the player has the option to select the number of players, along with whether each player is to be controlled by person or computer.</p>\n<p>\"The Game of Life,\" which allows two to four players, involves progressing through many events from the start of college or work, to retirement. The wheel, which can land on numbers 1-10, is meant to determine how many spaces (or sometimes how much money) the player proceeds (or gains). Each space can either mean earning or losing money, and/or it can affect the process of the players/opponent(s) through the game. A few spaces, however, must be landed on by every player. The goal is to retire with the most money.</p>\n<p>\"Pay Day\" is similar to \"The Game of Life\" in that the player must have the most money to win, and two to four players can participate. However, the length of the game can be determined, as the game (which is shaped like a calendar) can range from one to six months. The player may land on spaces that, once again, affect the amount of money possessed by oneself or others. There are \"Lottery,\" \"Event,\" and \"Auction\" spaces to name a few. At the end of each month is the \"Pay Day\" space.</p>\n<p>\"Yahtzee\" has the player roll dice to obtain certain combinations for points. Like the other two games, two through four players can participate; however, this game can also be a single-player experience. Each player gets to roll up to three times to try to fulfill their dice combination; one could try to roll ones, twos, threes, fours, fives, sixes, three of a kind, four of a kind, full house, small straight, large straight, or Yahtzee. If the player feels dissatisfied about the results, he/she can place the score for that turn into the \"Chance\" section; however, the score of each turn must go into one open space corresponding to one of the mentioned combinations. The most points earned wins.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the TV show and special of the same name, this game has the player complete a total of 20 different levels. <i>Story Mode</i> and <i>Play Any Game</i> are the two choices the player has when in the main menu.</p>\n<p><i>Story Mode</i> has the player select any level he/she wants to play from the 20, and go from there to the end. There are four levels each for France, Tanzania, Russia, and China; there are two for Dora's home once back from China. The first level of each involves going from country to country in varying modes of transportation. The second level of all five regions usually involves navigating through mazes and collecting three items. Only the second level in Russia has to do with skiing. The third in each of the four countries outside the Americas may vary between each other. The final one in each of the four have to do with finding each respective country's version of Swiper. The difficulty rises throughout the game in certain aspects. Also, the player may pause the game, but may not exit the level until it is finished. </p>\n<p>The level select menu is set up so the player first looks at two pages, each displaying about half of Earth. Then, once a location is selected, the player can choose from any section of the game in that region. Though Dora's home is a choice in both globe pages, the first takes the player to the beginning of the story, while the second takes the player towards the end. There are no levels in the first Americas choice, but the plot starts there. <i>Play Any Game</i> lets the player choose from any of the 20 levels to play. Once finished with it, the player goes back to the region's game select menu.</p>\n<p>The plot goes as follows:\nToday is Friendship Day, a worldwide celebration when friendship bracelets are worn by everyone. When worn, the bracelets will make the sky brighter by glowing. However, Swiper swiped friendship bracelets with his Swiper-copter, leaving the people of France, Tanzania, Russia, and China (mainly Paris, Mt. Kilimanjaro, the Winter Palace, and the Great Wall of China respectively) without them. Once realizing that the items swiped were friendship bracelets, Swiper felt repentance. After the Swiper-copter failed to work again, Dora and Swiper must return them back to those four countries a different way. Will they save Friendship Day?</p>",

It is up to Pac-Man to get the Golden Fruit back and restore order in Pac-Land. Run, bounce, roll, and swim your way through a variety of worlds to find the hidden fruits. There are also extra hidden Galaxian keys which unlock classic Pac-man mazes.</p>\n<p><em>Pac-Man World 2</em> is a side-scrolling platform game which has some depth to the play-field to allow for more movement than just left and right. There are a bunch of moves Pac-Man can pull off, such as a butt-bounce, a rev roll, a flip-kick or a rev jump. Some of these are dual function and aid in both reaching higher platforms or getting up steeper hills, as well as attacking enemies.</p>\n<p>The game also features a password system to get back to levels you have already played.</p>",

In this game, players take control of Angelica, who is running the school newspaper.</p>\n<p>Each story that she is working on is considered as a mission. Players will need to complete 8 missions in total.</p>\n<p>The Story Chase mode's gameplay involves finding the right character to talk to and sometimes finding and giving them specific items and playing mini-games to progress through the game. The mini-games that players complete in the story chase can then be played separately. Completing a mission awards players with a copy of the Class Paper.</p>\n<p>There are additional options in the game such as choosing which accessories Angelica will wear as well as switching the background music, image and character seen and heard in the menu, a PDA where players can make their own To Do lists, fill in personal details about them and their friends or take a quiz to find out which character from the TV series they resemble the most.</p>",

The game follows the Ed's quest to obtain as many jawbreakers as possible, which can either be found in the game world or purchased from candy machines for $1 accumulated from collecting pennies. The game features six distinct areas to explore and retains much of the art style and humor found in the TV show. Enemies encountered include dogs, squirrels, birds, and even water sprinklers and garden rakes. Characters from the show such as Kevin, Rolf, and the Kanker Sisters also make an appearance.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the 4Kids Entertainment adaptation of the One Piece anime and released exclusively in the United States, this sidescrolling action game features the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy in the East Blue. Recruiting his pirate crew, facing off against enemies with unusual powers, and facing of with the Navy as he travels between islands, players fight their way through seven Stories that consist of three stages each, the first two being platforming stages with the final level of a Story being a boss battle.</p>\n<p>Combat involves utilizing Luffy's rubber body to pull off moves like stretching his arm to attack from afar or inflating to deflect bullets, although most of the generic pirate enemies are defeated with a simple punch combo or aerial kick. The stretchy limbs also factor into level navigation like grabbing onto poles to launch Luffy to higher places or grabbing items that would otherwise be out of reach. Landing attacks will build up a power meter that can be used for either a special attack or to have Luffy's crew members to leap in and assist with their own attacks or by providing useful items.</p>\n<p>Between Stories a timed Ship Battle Royale takes place where the player needs to defeat all the enemies within a time limit. An infinite variation of this mode is unlocked through completing the main story, and by collecting pirate coins in the platforming levels the player can also unlock a boss rush mode.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the Japan-exclusive traveling exhibition <em>Jurassic Park Institute Tour</em>, this minigame collection has players taking part in five different dinosaur-themed minigames.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cross Dinosaur: A simple <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1540/frogger/\">Frogger</a>-style game. A helicopter lands on the far side of a field, and players have to dodge rampaging dinosaurs to reach it. Each person who reaches the helicopter gives the player 10 points, and the game continues until the player is hit by dinosaurs three times.</li>\n<li>Danger Zone: A sidescrolling game similar to Cross Dinosaur. Players control a dinosaur moving from the grass on the left side of the screen to a cave on the right while dodging falling rocks propelled from an active volcano.</li>\n<li>Egg Guard: Players control a mother dinosaur guarding her nest from humans who are coming from all eight directions. Players can scare away egg thieves by facing them straight on, but will lose a life if they let the thief reach the eggs.</li>\n<li>Rexercise: A \"Simon Says\"-style game. Players control a dinosaur who must remember sequences of button presses. Every time the player completes a round, players another button is added to the end. The game ends after the player makes three mistakes.</li>\n<li>Take Meat: Players control a mother dinosaur caring for her child. The nest is on one side of the screen, while some meat is on the other side. From a sidescrolling perspective, players have to make their way to the right side and fetch food, then bring it back safely to the nest while dodging falling rocks.</li>\n</ul>",

Pressing Select while playing as the Green Samurai Ranger makes him do a special attack which harms all surrounding enemies.</p>\n<p>Each ranger also has their own special attack which takes time to recharge and in each group the rangers have one out of two standard weapons they can attack with. In order to switch one weapon to the other, the rangers must destroy boxes and pick up the weapon. Usually, one of the weapons is a close-range sword, while the other is a longer-range weapon such as a blaster or a long fire blade for the Green Samurai Ranger. Collecting the same weapon will also level up the weapon making it do more damage.</p>\n<p>After going through the stage and defeating the boss in combat, players switch to a megazord battle where they must press the A and B button, as well as a direction button in time to do an attack on the enemy. When the meter on the bottom is almost completely red and the enemy is almost defeated, players can do a stronger attack by pressing one of the buttons simultaneously with the R button and doing that successfully will prompt players to use an item to attack.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Operation Armored Liberty is a Game Boy Advance remake of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/31178/garry-kitchens-super-battletank-war-in-the-gulf/\">Super Battletank</a>. Taking place during the invasion of Iraq, the player controls a lone M1A1 Abrams Main Battle Tank from the first-person viewpoint. Each of the ten levels requires the player to defeat all enemies on the map to proceed. To accomplish this, players are given several different weapons and abilities, including their tank's main cannon and a smoke screen. Levels three and onward feature boss battles against a static objective at the end of each level. The player is also given the opportunity to visit friendly bases to repair damage and rearm their tank. </p>\n<p>Despite the gameplay being similar to the original SNES release of Super Battletank, there are some changes made in Operation Armored Liberty. The game's time period has been updated to feature the more recent 2003 Invasion of Iraq in contrast to the original's setting in Operation Desert Storm. Operation Armored Liberty also features a password save system and allows for unlimited retries after failing a level. Gameplay has also been changed as the player now has an unlimited fire rate for their main cannon and are no longer able to traverse their turret left or right.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Lizzie McGuire 2: Lizzie Diaries</em> is largely a 2D side-scrolling platformer based on the Disney American comedy television series that ran between 2001 and 2004. Lizzie needs to complete levels avoiding obstacles and enemies. The latter can also be taken out by jumping on top of them. Lizzie has a limited amount of health, but when dead a level does not need to be restarted completely and the number of lives is infinite. The main goal is to reach the end of the level but optionally a certain number of diary collectibles can be picked up. In one level she needs to stay ahead of cheerleaders that chase her through the entire level.</p>\n<p>Next to the regular platforming other levels contain several activities and mini-games such as playing games of beach volleyball, badminton, surviving a food fight, completing a waterski course, mimicking a dancing routine, dressing up Lizzie with a correct outfit, a time management game as a waitress and so on.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Hachiemon and his friends are having a lovely day on Hachi Isle, when a strange incident occurs. The friends that came to play with him have suddenly lost their lips! Without lips, eating and talking are difficult for them. Time for Hachiemon to be a hero and get everyone their lips back!</p>\n<p><em>Hachiemon</em> is a 2D platformer starring the titular egg-shaped character with big red angled lips. He can use his lips in various ways, throwing them like a boomerang or grabbing onto walls and platforms, even slingshotting himself. Some enemies can be stunned temporarily by giving them a quick smooch with his lips. He can also roll to attack, but rolling for too long makes him dizzy. Many enemies, obstacles, and occasional boss fights stand in the way of his quest for the lost lips.</p>\n<p>The Hachiemon character was originally created as an advertising mascot for the TV station KTV (Kansai Television or Kantele for short). In game, Hachiemon sometimes exclaims \"Kantele\" (\u30ab\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30ec), like on the title screen or when pushing the left shoulder button.</p>\n<p>Hachiemon comments on some events, like pausing, smooching or getting hurt, with voice clips in which he has a comically deep and expressionless voice.</p>",

In each level, the player finds acorns which act as health. Enemies are countered by jumping on them, stomping the ground, walloping them with Manny's trunk or by launching a giant acorn. Some of the levels will have the player take control of Sid to run through a hazardous plain with various pitfalls and enemies until he reaches the end. When a certain number of acorns remains in the player's inventory by the end of a level, the player can acquire extra content.</p>",

This is a simple, child-friendly 2D platformer. This time, players can play as either a dog or a cat. Like in the first game, dogs can hover short distances by flapping their tea leaf ears; cats, meanwhile, are able to double jump. This game also features a detailed character creation system, and players are able to play as their custom designed dog or cat in the main game. Custom characters can also be imported into the later game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/187456/ochaken-no-heya-ds-2/\">Ochaken no Heya DS 2</a>.</p>\n<p>As a bonus, new copies came with a small ochaneko toy.</p>",

Players control a witch named Straw who is tasked with organizing the constellations in the sky. Using a cursor, players can nudge stars up and down; once they've aligned a gorup of stars into a straight line, they score points. As the game continues, players have to be able to deal with groups of stars physically close to each other, meaning that it becomes more difficult to find ways to organize lines properly. Completing lines within a short time period grants the player bonus points.</p>",

While looking for it, Dora and Boots met Pirate Pig, who offered them to help him search for his treasure chest.</p>\n<p>Based on the Nick Jr. television series, this platformer carries the player through eight locations on the map. In each location, three levels require the player to play as Dora and/or Boots to collect three stars. 30 coins also scatter each level, yet they are optional. Varying items, which help the player progress, are placed in each level. However, watch out for Swiper, who sneaks around, trying to steal your collected items.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This game features the three Hasbro board games mentioned in the title. Each board game maintains the option of having the music and sound effects on or off.</p>\n<p><em>Mouse Trap</em> has players build a contraption and attempt to trap each other with it. Two to four players can play, and at least one if the players must be controlled by a person. Players are mice who navigate around the edge of the board; spaces can either let a player obtain or lose cheese (which can be used by him/her to move mice when the contraption is complete and he/she is on the \"turn crank\" space), allow a piece of the contraption to be added (if the space displays the number of players), move the player to a different space, start the finished contraption (around the end of the board), or do nothing (whether it is the safe space or a build space without showing the number of players). The contraption may run when one of the mice is on the cheese wheel at the end of the board while another mouse is on the space that starts the contraption; the mouse on the cheese wheel gets trapped and therefore eliminated. The last one standing wins.</p>\n<p><em>Operation</em> lets players take on medical roles to remove objects from a patient named Cavity Sam. One to four human players can play on either easy, medium, or hard mode. Each player can choose one of four human portraits to represent him/herself. \"Classic\", \"speed,\" \"skill,\" and \"skill + speed\" are the four modes available. In \"classic,\" the player draws the top card from the deck, which states a certain job, whether it is \"doctor\" or \"specialist.\" On the other side of the card is the object to remove from Cavity Sam, along with the cash reward. The player must choose to commit to the procedure if he/she is the only one playing; the player also has the choice to turn down the offer if there are multiple players. If the player succeeds, he/she gets paid the said amount and the item is removed from the game. If he/she touches the silver edges, the item stays and no profit is made. \"Speed\" has players remove objects in 15 seconds (which is really about 30 seconds); another possibility of operation failure, which is the time running down to 0, is featured in this mode. \"Skill\" has players remove an object with a hand that gets more shaky as it gets closer to the object. In single player games, the player wins when all items are removed; in multiplayer games, the player with the most money wins. High scores based on money made are also available.</p>\n<p><em>Simon</em> is a memorization game which has players repeat what is played by the machine itself. The pattern gets one additional button press for every next level. The game, which consists of four buttons, only allows one player to participate. Levels can be changed between one and four, which ranges from combinations of 8 to 14 to 20 to 31. The game is over when either the player messes up a pattern once or completes the level played on. High scores based on pattern levels are also available.</p>",

Unlike the other versions this is a side-scrolling 2D platformer with condensed gameplay to meet the technical standards of the Game Boy Advance.</p>\n<p>Charlie Bucket is a young, humble, chocolate-loving child who lives with a family in poverty. One day, Willy Wonka, the mysterious man who runs his own chocolate factory in Charlie's municipality created a contest; five golden tickets, one in each Wonka chocolate bar, were dispersed randomly around the world. Recipients of each ticket win a one-day tour around Wonka's factory, and one of the five winners will win a prize beyond one's dreams. Will Charlie find one of the tickets? If so, will he be the one lucky winner?</p>\n<p>There are three save slots available. Upon choosing a save slot to use, the player gets taken to the game type menu. He/she may choose <em>Adventure</em>, <em>Mini-Games</em>, or <em>Oompa-Loompa Album</em>. In <em>Adventure</em>, the player gets to complete the games 14 main levels that follows loosely the main movie story line. The player can complete the first level, <em>In Town</em>, and collect 25 square candies that look round throughout each of eight levels to unlock one illustration each in the <em>Oompa-Loompa Album</em>; It has nine illustrations in total. The player can also find all five letters that make up <em>WONKA</em> in each of five levels to unlock one mini-game each; five mini-games are available to unlock. For both the mini-games and photo album, the player initially starts with none to play or look at.</p>\n<p>The player starts with five lives, and has a life bar of five segments, which resemble connected pieces of chocolate. When the player's life bar is low, a full Wonka bar can restore it to full energy. Whenever the player loses all lives in the main game, he/she gets a still <em>Game Over</em> screen before being taken back to the first game menu. If the player wants to proceed through the story after losing all lives, he/she must restart on the same level where the player lost. Each level that gets completed is replayable, and they can help the player fulfill the <em>Mini-Games</em> and the <em>Oompa-Loompa Album</em>.</p>",

When Sh\u016bto's father Genz\u014d gives him a special \"Snap Shooter\" camera which can turn photographs of Wonders into cards with special powers, Sh\u016bto sets off to compete in the Snap Grand Prix, a tournament where players compete with their cards to be crowned the Snap champion. Along the way, Sh\u016bto encounters both friends and enemies as well as a conspiracy by an organization called Magnet which captures and exploits Wonders.</p>\n<p><em>Snapkid's</em> is a role-playing/card battle game. Throughout the game, the player explores the world and encounters wild Wonders to take pictures of before using the resulting cards in tournaments against computer-controlled opponents. When encountering a Wonder, the game switches to a first-person camera mode where the player must follow the Wonder with their crosshair in an attempt to take the best possible photograph. Taking a photograph will result in a card being generated, with the abilities of the card varying depending on the distance at which the picture was taken and the species and behavior of the photographed Wonder. In the card battle segments, the player can form a deck of up to 30 cards to use against their opponent. The player wins if the opponent's HP is reduced to 0, or if the deck from which the opponent can draw cards from runs out.</p>",

Any traffic violations such as going down a one-way street earns penalties. The player is ranked depending on performance. In the adventure mode, the player can play as one of the Olsen twins and can select a type of car, which grows in variety as the player progresses, the ultimate goal being to earn enough money to afford a private beach party to celebrate Sweet 16.</p>",

The guardians are entrusted with magic stones, only to lose them. The heroes travel through portals to acquire those stones, before Phobos himself gets hold of them.</p>\n<p>Throughout the game, the player will control one of the guardians. Each guardian must navigate through platforming levels, using unique elemental powers to get past enemies and hazards. At any time, the player can switch to another guardian in order to use different powers for specific encounters. Some levels have unique playable characters. Many levels have their own objectives to complete and gimmicks that make them unique.</p>",
