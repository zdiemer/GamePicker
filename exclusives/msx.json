        "description": "<p>The year is 2042, the stage is a huge futuristic city Neo Kobe. Among the remains of passengers who died in a plane crash, experts discovered a strange biomechanical organism. Recent events proved that it was not the only appearance of a \"snatcher\" -a robotic creature who can masterfully disguise itself as a human being in order to infiltrate and to destroy human society. Gillian Seed, a man who suffers from amnesia, remembers just this word: \"snatcher\". He joins the Junkers, a combat unit whose goal is to track down and to exterminate the snatchers, and is determined to find out the truth about those creatures and his past.</p>\n<p><em>SD Snatcher</em> is based on the same story as the more famous <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7524/snatcher/\"> Snatcher</a>, but gameplay-wise it is an entirely different game: an RPG. You navigate your hero from top-down view, enter buildings and talk to people. In many locations you'll meet enemies who are visible on the screen. Upon contact with an enemy, a turn-based battle begins. You can choose to fire from a variety of weapons, and to target a specific part of the enemy's body. Targeting has a direct effect in battles: for example, shooting the enemy's gun will weaken it, destroying its wheels will prevent it from avoiding your shots to its face or body, etc. You gain experience points (\"rank points\"), improving in different categories (speed, defense, etc.). You also improve your weapon skills by continuously using the same weapon.</p>\n<p>Unlike <em>Snatcher</em> with its \"serious\" graphics, the characters in <em>SD Snatcher</em> have a typically Japanese anime \"super-deformed\" style, which adds an element of a parody to the game.</p>",

However, the investigation leads Randar also to other planets, and gradually he realizes that the mysterious vanishing is a part of a larger scheme...</p>\n<p><em>Randar II</em> features traditional top-down navigation and turn-based combat. The battles and the movement in town are viewed from first-person perspective. During battles, Randar can attack either with a gun or a sword. There are no magic spells in the game.

One day, his father send him to a nearby cave which is plagued by orcs, to defeat King Orc.

The enemies appear randomly on each screen, one after another, become visible and attack the hero if he doesn't move. If you leave the screen, the enemies will disappear, but re-spawn quickly when you return. It is possible to avoid combat by continuously walking, although in narrow areas you'll often find yourself trapped by enemies.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Have you ever wondered how and why evil appeared among us? It all started with jealousy. That was the first dark emotion that possessed human beings. Out of jealousy came doubt, then envy, anger, and finally hatred. Peace could no longer be maintained. Minions of darkness appeared among humans. The king and his counsel find a way to seal the heart of darkness, but it came to life again and destroyed the counselors. Now you, a nameless hero, is the king's and the country's only hope. Go, hero! Save our land from the forces of darkness! And don't ever, ever be jealous!!</p>\n<p><em>Dark Sider</em> is a traditional Japanese-style RPG with slight erotic content. Along regular monsters you'll fight some who resemble scantily dressed sexy girls. You navigate your hero from top-down perspective, and fight randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first person perspective.</p>",

The evil wizard Galious used his dark powers to ascend to the heavens and kidnap the baby's soul, and lock it away inside a prison in the labyrinth of rooms of his castle. The couple must transverse the maze-like building and travel to ten worlds, fighting against hordes of walking skeletons, vampire bats, and other bizarre creatures to finally reach Galious himself and kill him to liberate Pamperses' ghost.</p>\n<p><em>Maze of Galious</em> is a game where you have to kill thousands of enemies, collect items in order to obtain new powers, and defeat bosses at the end of each level. You are free to go everywhere you want from the beginning of the game, thus you have to choose very carefully the order in which you visit all the rooms in the huge map if you want to keep your character alive.</p>\n<p>The world is divided into a main map (called the Castle) and 10 sub-maps (called the Worlds). Initially you are in the Castle, and you have to find the keys that open the doors to go to each of the Worlds. To complete the game, you have to defeat the boss at the end of each one of the 10 worlds. You are free to revisit each world as often as you want, in order to see if you have missed something. Each character has special abilities, i.e. Popolon has a greater ability to jump and Aphrodite is able to dive.</p>",

The game encourages improvement and competition by storing high scores. The main difference is that this Pac-Man clone contains digitized speech. If a monster catches you then the computer screams '<em>Oh Shit!</em>'.</p>\n<p>A non-offensive version of this game was released under the name <em>Oh No!</em>.</p>",

A rain of blows can produce a quick knockout, but in general you must hit him many times, and then with a knockout blow, to see him go down. There is a referee.

In each level of this platform game you - a Choro Q car - have to build two other cars. The components from which a car must be built are chassis, engine and coachwork, what of course must occur in the correct order. During your attempt to build cars you are pursued by hostile cars and tanks. When the first car is assembled entirely it then will change into a coin. Collecting that coin gives you temporarily invulnerability, so you can chase the hostile cars and tanks for bonuses. Don't drive too fast or you will fall from the platform or crash into the wall.</p>",

Rather than a partial circle the protagonist in this game is a vacuum cleaner, and as such must vacuum-clean each room; the ghosts of the original Pac-Man being changed into broom sticks. The gameplay is essentially identical to that of <em>Vacuumania</em>'s forebears -- gobble dust for points and dodge the brooms which threaten the player's vacuum. If the player has recently grabbed one of the special dust dots that allows them to eat the brooms then they can instead be consumed.</p>",

It is up to Lolo to rescue Lala by travelling through Egger's domain and solving the puzzle rooms laid out before him.\nYou must guide Lolo through a room of tiles and collect all of the Heart Framers in the room. Doing this opens up a Jewel Box, which contains an item. Successfully acquiring the contents of the Jewel Box will clear the room of all monsters and open the way to the next room(s). Luckily for you Lolo has a weapon: the Magic Shot. Two shots can be obtained by collecting certain Heart Framers.\nThere are other types of obstacles in the levels, as well, such as water and Emerald Framers (green blocks that Lolo may push around freely).</p>",

The randomly placed green rolling dam stones-like objects are also to be collected. But that's not all. The board contains three types of hazards.

The third danger are the randomly placed bombs on the board. You have thirty seconds to disarm them by grabbing them. If all tiles have been collected and you didn't get stuck: congratulations!

The enemies must be cleared from a level to go on to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points. Bub and Bob must blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. These fruits must be collected! Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms.</p>",

No, they are in control of a robot (maybe a humanoid). The robot is running around defending and attacking the enemy while avoiding obstacles and holes in the ground. For the rest it's pretty much all the same: it's fast, has many enemies, hard to beat level bosses and has lots of power-ups. If the player destroys a space ship they will be rewarded with power-ups.</p>",

They will disappear when you've walked over them. Remember that! You have to collect them all... and don't get stuck! The randomly placed green rolling dam stones-like objects are also to be collected. But that's not all. The board contains three types of hazards. The first ones are the purple monsters, don't step on them or you 'll get killed. The second hazard is the boots, who move around the board. Don't let them kick you! The third danger is the randomly placed bombs on the board. You have thirty seconds to disarm them by grabbing them. If all tiles have been collected and you didn't get stuck: congratulations! You're off to the next level! The game contains digitized speech, which you will hear when the game starts, when you walked into an hazard and at Game Over.</p>",

The Recon mode is a port of the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/11460/xevious/\">Xevious</a>; the Scramble mode can be considered its sequel, adding sixteen new stages, enemies, and boss battles, as the brave fighter pilots continue to defend the Earth against its former inhabitants, who migrated to the planet Xevious thousands of years ago and are now determined to re-capture their ancestral homeland.</p>\n<p>The game's Scramble mode allows the player to control three other aircrafts in addition to the series' trademark Solvalou, each possessing unique weapons. These aircrafts include Solgrado (armed with spread shot), Zeodalley (twin back fire), and Gampmission, a large ship that is also a combination of the previous three, with massive firepower and enhanced lock-on abilities. A specific aircraft can be assigned to each of the player's \"lives\". The amount of points needed to gather an extra life increases if the player selects more powerful ships. Also, enemies become progressively harder as the controlled aircraft collects power-ups.</p>",

In this game you have to solve different sorts of calculations within a given time limit.</p>\n<p>The equations are presented on a unbalanced lever, one arm of the lever contains the equation and the outcome on the other arm.\nOne number in the equations is missing and you 'll have to find the right number and place it in the equation.\nWhen the equations are solved correctly the levers will balance. </p>\n<p>The time limit is represented by a truck at the top of the screen that drives from right to left over the balanced levers and it will fall down if you are not able to balance the levers in time and you loose a life.</p>",

One day, the Quiz king gives his son a pet dragon which the prince soon becomes very fond of. Unfortunately, his girlfriend is not equally fond of losing his attention, so she takes the dragon and leaves, intending to abandon it in a far-off place, so that it may never return and contend for her prince's love. Thus, the prince sets off to find his girlfriend and his pet dragon, somewhere in the Quiz kingdom. </p>\n<p>During his quest, the prince meets both friends and foes and lots of monsters. However, since this story is set in the Quiz kingdom, the battles are not fought using the usual RPG formula of weapons and magic spells. Instead, the monsters pose trivia questions which the player must answer. The prince loses hit points if a wrong answer is given. Getting the answer right awards the player with money, with which it is possible to buy equipment or lodge to regain health. Some adversaries won't let the prince pass unless he has made enough correct answers, which means that the player's quiz prowess is somewhat equivalent to experience points in normal RPGs.</p>\n<p>The questions range from linguistic matters (usually questions about Hiroshima dialect) and game trivia to technical matters or the Thunderbirds.</p>",

Enemies encountered are of the standard type found in most early games of the genre, such as bats and skeletons.  To help navigate through the maze-like levels, a map is available for access.

        "description": "<p>Jagur: Golden Triangle is something as unusual as a cross between <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Commando\">Commando</a> and an action RPG such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/56583/ys/\">Ys</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/12807/hydlide/\">Hydlide</a>.</p>\n<p>You start out with your character Jef jumping off a boat somewhere in the Golden Triangle between Laos, Burma and Thailand, presumably to fight drug lords. A typical Commando or Ikari-styled mission. The town Jef enters is inhabited by gangsters of all kinds who shoot at you. Thankfully, some of the locals are quite friendly, offering to sell you drugs (of the medical kind?), food or even weapons. Other offer you vital information. The clues you are given lead you to the right house, where you may find a friend who has previously been captured. Your quest is then to find the right bribe for your mate to be released. The puzzles begin in the simplest fashion, so as not to interfere with the action aspects of the game. Soon, all five members of the team are gathered, and the quest may go on farther into the triangle, where opposition will be fiercer and the puzzles harder. Thankfully, slain enemies will often drop munitions or money, so that you may keep your arsenal updated and your team alive, not to mention bribing the right people.</p>\n<p>Though featuring a lot of action, Jagur 5 has enough RPG emphasis to actually have an experience meter. A strategic element involves choosing the right team leader and the right formation to handle different tasks. Instead of magic spells, bombs, grenades or bazookas are used, and medical supplies replace magic potions, making Jagur 5 one of few RPGs which don't involve magic, though it may not count as a proper RPG in everyone's eyes.</p>",

One Spanish programmer took it upon himself to port the title to the humble MSX1, and released it as part of the MSXdev'03 contest. However, he never asked the then-defunct <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/3206/compile/\">Compile</a> for permission.</p>\n<p>The game uses the exact same rules and even the same puzzles as the GBA original, as well as the original sprites. The graphics make good use of the limited power of the MSX, with many colours, and even renders the player character using multicolour sprites. Due to the limitations in the number of sprites that may be displayed, only one duck is responsible for shooting the blocks that fill in the picture that is to be completed for each level (the GBA original uses two ducks). While the game replicates the original gameplay, it lacks the storyline and does not display a coloured version of the completed pictures, something which would not fit into the 32K of memory used by the game. Instead, Guru Logic for the MSX1 concentrates on the puzzle gameplay that is central to the game, giving a clear impression of what Guru Logic Champ might have looked like had it been conceived ten years earlier.</p>",

The objective: shoot the enemy warroid until it has no energy left. Destroying the enemy warroid will give the player one point on the six-point scale (the player starts out with three points each). When all points are lit in the player's color, the player wins the game. Controlling the warroid is easy, since it will always point its gun towards the enemy droids. Just push the space key to shoot a lot and jump away from the line of fire. There are multiple platform-like levels for the player to fight in.</p>\n<p>A menu (called up by pressing the escape key) will let the player customize the game so as to set handicap and the colours of the player's warroids.</p>",

There are jars which may contain both treasures and danger, and which block the way. You have an inventory, but it can only contain one item at any time. Take care in what you pick up and leave behind. Juggling the inventory becomes a basic skill since items will block the narrow passages of the dungeon. Basic items are keys, for opening the door to the next dungeon, as well as cheese, which is good for the adventuring mouse's stamina. The dungeon must be completed within a set time or it's game over.</p>\n<p>Control the mouse with the cursor keys, and use the following keys to issue commands:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>B: Crush jar</li>\n<li>T: Take item</li>\n<li>O: Open door</li>\n<li>P: Leave item behind</li>\n<li>E: Eat cheese</li>\n<li>K: Kick frog</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p>Life in the Fast Lane can best be described as a cross between <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Trailblazer\">Trailblazer</a>, for its bouncy ball on a chequered path action, and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/21195/elektraglide/\">Elektraglide</a> for its twisty road and futuristic enemies and obstacles.</p>\n<p>Your task is simple: Travel as far as you can on the road inside your rolling sphere. There are obstacles in the road that you must avoid, either by going to the left or right or by jumping over them. Unlike Trailblazer, you can jump a whole lot, even to the point of virtually flying above the level. Not even then are you safe, though, since airplanes will attack you in the sky.</p>\n<p>The ground has holes in it. If you miscalculate a leap, and fall into a black hole, you are dropped into something very much like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tempest\">Tempest</a>, with your sphere moving across the outer edge of a space tunnel, shooting at the things that come out of it. If you fall into a water-filled hole, you fall through the road and find that it runs above a river. Here, you are attacked by fish, but luckily you can shoot back at them (something you cannot do on the ground). The next time there is a whole in the ground, you have a chance to resurface. All the while, you must make sure not to expend your jumping and shooting power bars, or you will be left vulnerable.</p>",

After traversing the cursed landscape, you enter a castle, which will be directly recognisable to anyone who has played Castlevania.</p>\n<p>Equipped only with a whip, the hero must choose his battles. However, strewn across the levels are keys which will open chests containing bonuses which will render (short-term) invincibility, lengthen your whip or grant you a subweapon, such as a throwing dagger or an hourglass to freeze time momentarily. Subweapons consume hearts, which can be found not only in chests, but by destroying monsters or whipping down candles from the castle's walls.</p>\n<p>The Cure features a soundtrack with several pieces throughout, swap-screen \"scrolling\" and both hardware and plotted sprites.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In 2038 AD, the United States of America, Europe and East-Asia joined their forces in the development of space technology. The joint venture was called STAR (Space Transport And Research). One of the goals of the joint venture was to explore the possibilities of transdimensional voyages to the nearest star system, Alpha Centauri. Six years later, a prototype of the transdimensional drive was completed. Test pilot Jim Benson is to take the craft on its maiden voyage. In a technical mishap, too much energy is injected into the drive, and the Einstein-Rosen bridge doesn't work out as calculated. Instead, Jim ends up in an unknown part of space unidentifiable to the board computer. <em>Universe: Unknown!</em></p>\n<p>As a game, U:U owes much inspiration to Konami's classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/540/gradius-series/\">Nemesis</a> games for the MSX. Horizontally scrolling (albeit at a jittery pace, due to being programmed for the MSX1), your sole spaceship must shoot down wave upon wave of alien enemies. Killed enemies often leave behind upgrade capsules for your weapon. The weapons are similar to Nemesis, containing both bullets and lasers as well as bombs and auxiliary weapon pods; so-called <em>options</em>. The weapon system differs somewhat, in that you can choose freely between different weapons as long as you have collected enough upgrade capsules. A meter at the bottom shows your current weapons energy level.</p>\n<p>After a beginning in open space, you enter a system of caverns. Just like in Nemesis, this requires both precise timing and precise memorisation of evasive manoeuvres. The usual enemies, such as turrets, pods which spawn clusters of enemies, and falling pieces of the terrain are all present. Choosing the right weapon for the task helps, but manoeuvring is the decisive element in surviving the often cramped caves.</p>\n<p>This game made second place in the MSXdev '05 coding contest.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Griel's Quest for the Sangraal is an MSX1 remake of the old MSX2 puzzle game, Gurieru no Seihai (The Holy Grail of Griel) by Momonoki House, first published in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=peach-up-4\">Peach Up 4</a> in 1990.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is similar both to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1715/soko-ban/\">Soukoban</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Adventures+of+Lolo+Series\">Lolo</a> games, though the focus is not on moving boxes around. Instead, you are a knight who must pick up magic objects to vanquish evil creatures. The following objects can be found:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Magical Staff \u2013 Vanquishes RPG slimes.</li>\n<li>Holy Cross \u2013 Vanquishes ghosts.</li>\n<li>Sacred Sword \u2013 Kills ogres.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Only one magical object may be carried at any one time, and it cannot be dropped. The only way to get rid of an object is to use it against an enemy. Just as in the aforementioned puzzle games, the emphasis is therefore on picking up objects in the right order. This can get very tricky not only if a monster is in front of a desirable object, but also if it is behind an object which you can't pick up or can't use against any enemy within your reach. To complicate matters, many levels contain tiles which only allow movement in one direction, so that one can easily get stuck and must forfeit. Luckily, the monsters are immobile, so that at least timing is not a variable in the quest for the Sangraal. To aid you in your quest, you are given a password every five levels.</p>\n<p>This adaptation was made for the MSXdev '05 coding contest.</p>",

Use the space key to accelerate; the car will decelerate once released. In order to keep up with the traffic, players will often find themselves \"pumping\" the accelerator to keep the speed at a balanced level during takeovers and other sticky situations. Otherwise they risk running into either the car in front or the one behind. Players have five \"lives\", and losing a life also means losing speed and precious seconds. A red gauge on the side of the screen displays the player's position on the track; a green one counts down the seconds in which they have to complete the race. The game has two levels with five races each. Each race has a different locale and time of day.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Whereas most platforms, including the MSX, received their own versions of Activision's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Aliens\">Aliens</a>, Square gave Japanese MSX users a unique spin-off.</p>\n<p><em>Aliens: Alien 2</em> is an arcade platformer (or run'n'gun if you like) featuring Ripley on a planet infested with aliens. Armed with only a basic gun at first, she faces facehuggers that come out of alien eggs. After having dispatched a face hugger, the egg may be shot to reveal an item. Items may be hand grenades, stronger guns or wing items which make her jump longer. For some reason, the planet is infested not only with aliens and their offspring, but also with snakes. After clearing the surface level, Ripley enters a complex where the first boss, a giant, full-grown alien resides. The following level takes place within the complex.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on Nippon Sunrise's animation series of the eighties, your goal in <em>Vifam</em> is to guide your mothership to a specific planet while surviving the assault of enemy robots.</p>\n<p>The game is divided into three screens, or monitors:  </p>\n<p>Monitor 1 is a two-dimensional starmap, where you guide your ship through the planet system while avoiding being pulled into a planet's gravity field. If this happens, the game switches to a screen displaying the planet in close-up, and you must immediately accelerate out of its vicinity. The radar screen displays both approaching enemy robots and an arrow pointing to your destination. You have a limited fuel supply, so time must not be wasted.</p>\n<p>If the red dots on your radar come too close, you must switch to monitor 2, where you fly the robot Vifam in a first-person perspective through space in order to shoot the enemy down. After that, you can return to the mother ship and resume your voyage. Monitor 3 is used for servicing Vifam.</p>\n<p>Once you've reached the red planet, the game wraps around and you must do the same voyage again.</p>",

        "description": "<p>As the title implies, this is a game about breaking into banks, as well as a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Breakout\">Break-Out</a> clone.</p>\n<p>Each level is a bank, consisting of several rooms. You can only leave a room after your ball hits a key. As a burgler, you are symbolised by a pair of eyes, on top of which a paddle rests. Similarly to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/24560/woody-pop/\">Woody Pop</a>, parts of the bottom of the screen is covered up, so that you need not guard the ball as much as in other games. Unlike most Break-Out clones, you can move freely over the entire screen so as to hit the ball at the perfect spot. If you miss the ball and it passes through the void at the bottom, it falls back into the earlier rooms, just like in the Amiga classic, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/13354/poing/\">Poing</a>. If you catch it there, you can send it back to the room your were in. In the last room of each bank, you should hit the money that is in there, before you hit the square with a calculator, which will calculate your score for that bank. Later vaults feature a bell which must not be hit, or it will wake a guardian that will hunt you across the screen.</p>\n<p>As in all post-<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Arkanoid\">Arkanoids</a>, powerups are available, in the shape of a circle that bounces across the screen, all the while changing colours. Depending on which colour it is when you pick it up with your paddle, you get one bonus out of a range which corresponds to the basics of most games in the genre, such as wider paddle, sticky paddle, multiball and firepower.</p>",

Using its dimensional powers, Laxis escaped to another era. Using your dimensional controller-equipped power suit, the Arouza, you must hunt down and destroy Laxis.</p>\n<p>Starting out in space, you control Arouza, which bears an uncanny resemblance to the metal knights in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/22190/herzog/\">Herzog</a>, as it flies towards the enemy. In the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1434/space-harrier/\">Space Harrier</a> vein, you see your character from behind while enemies appear from the horizon. On later stages, set above the planet surface, the resemblance is stronger, especially since you can run on the ground. You have two weapon systems, consisting of a gun and target-seeking missiles, which have a limited supply. Arouza can be upgraded using powerups released when killing certain enemies. Upgrading is a good precaution before you encounter the end-of-level bosses, since you only have one life (with a power bar, mind you) to waste.</p>",

        "description": "<p>One day, a young cave princess called Malaika comes back from a visit to her relatives, only to find that all inhabitants of her village are gone. The villagers have been turned into energy crystals by aliens from the future, who plan to use Malaika's fellows as fuel for their machines. Malaika sets out to rescue her friends and put a stop to the aliens' plans.</p>\n<p>You control Malaika in a basic platform game, playing like a cross between <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Super+Mario+Bros\">Super Mario Bros</a> and the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Wonder+Boy\">Wonder Boy</a>, but without any offensive weapons. The mainstay of the enemies are coloured blobs, most of which disappear when you jump on them. The purple blobs are more dangerous, since they can electrocute Malaika if she jumps on them at the wrong time. Other enemies are flying blobs and Super Mario-style cannons.</p>\n<p>When you jump on an enemy, you bounce just a little bit higher than a normal jump. Using this effectively means that Malaika can reach high-up places which would otherwise remain inaccessible. </p>\n<p>Powerups are available in the shape of stars which will render Malaika invincible for a short time, just like in Mario, and extra lives. Malaika does not die on first contact with an enemy, since you have a graded system of three hearts which are expended when you touch an enemy. Hearts can also be found at some points to restore your health. Spread throughout the levels are the small crystals that used to be friendly cavepeople. Clearing a level with 100 or more crystals will give you bonus points. There are six worlds to clear, each made up of four levels. Each world has an end-of-level boss to beat.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the 2006 edition of the MSXdev coding contest.</p>",

Instead, he takes some of the mushrooms growing in the environs, and loses his senses.</p>\n<p>In this platform-puzzle game, which plays like a deranged <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Jet+Set+Willy\">Jet Set Willy</a>, you guide the naked J-war around the one-screen platform levels, trying to pick up all the pills and mushrooms. You are chased by a set of clothes, contact with which must be avoided. When you eat pills, you move quickly but jump poorly. Eating mushrooms makes you slow, but jump far. Taking this into consideration is the key to successfully completing the level. Some places can only be reached by eating mushrooms, and when you eat the pills in that place, you are quick enough to run away from the shirt and trousers.</p>\n<p>This libelous game was coded for the 2006 edition of the MSXdev coding contest.</p>",

There are no enemies, apart from gravity itself. You will need to plan your path, or you could end up in a spot where there are no adjacent platforms to jump to. For each jump you do, you receive 100 points, and additional points just by walking around on the platform. Since the playfield is randomly generated each time you start, this is a game you will never tire of (?).</p>\n<p>Pointless Platform was coded for the 2006 edition of the MSXdev coding contest.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Grid Wars is best described as a cross between classic Jeff Minter games such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Gridrunner\">Gridrunner</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a>. The playfield looks and sounds just like Gridrunner or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/54827/matrix/\">Matrix</a>. In the middle of the grid is your space ship, and on all four sides of the grid are moving cannons which will try to shoot you down. Your task is to avoid the fire coming from all directions, while picking up the \"energon cubes\" that will let your ship fly to the next level. With so much happening on screen and the clean graphics, this looks like something Mr. Minter forgot in his desk drawer some day back in 1984.</p>\n<p>Grid Wars was made for the 2006 edition of the MSXdev coding contest.</p>",

This means that animations are removed from the battle scenes. As the game takes place on Planet Oldskool, your units are all named after famous chips in computers such as the Z80, the 6502 or the SID. Since it's an MSX game, all the heroes are chips found in that computer. \"Grunts\" are DRAM chips, such as the 4164 and the bigger 41256. Even though the units are integrated circuits, they are represented in the game by giant robots, whose graphics seem to be ripped straight out of the original Super Robot Taisen.</p>\n<p>In this turn-based strategy game, you move your units across the varying terrain, and launch an attack if possible. All units have ballistic weapons with a certain range, as well as close combat weapons which may only be used against enemy units on directly adjacent squares. You must weigh in the power of the weapon, its accuracy as well as remaining ammunition when launching an attack. After all your units have moved, it's the enemy movement phase. Since different units have different weapons, speed and range, they must be arranged in a formation that makes for effective tactics \u2013 artillery in the back and speedy units close the front to draw enemy fire. Veteran units level up just as in an RPG.</p>\n<p>After completing each stage, you are given a cash bonus with which to upgrade your units. At the beginning of each stage, another unit is added to your army, reflecting the evolution of the MSX system. In the six levels, you must face the chips of the C64, the Atari, the 80286 and the 80386.</p>",

Furthermore, you've promised to be home at 3:00, and your watch is missing too. Suddenly, you are approached by a police officer who asks for your ID, and you can't seem to find that either. You run from the police, into the night city. You must find your identification, your watch and your keys before 3 o'clock!</p>\n<p>In this arcade adventure game, you run through the streets of the bleak city infested with rats, angry policemen and evil ghosts, looking for your belongings. The streets scroll from left to right, and going up or down takes you to another street. You've got a gun with which to kill the enemies, but they respawn quickly, and when you've run out of bullets, you can only rely on kicks, or try to avoid the ghosts' rays by ducking. At some spots, you can replenish your energy and ammunition.</p>\n<p>Finding your watch will let you know how much time you have left, the ID papers will stop the police from bothering you, and finding all your keys will allow you to get home and end the game. The action is fast, and so is the in-game music accompanying the suitably toned-downed graphics of Night City.</p>",

On a one-screen playfield, you have a group of dinosaurs opposing a computer-controlled group of beasts. As in chess, you move your creatures around the board, each creature having different movement patterns and range; some move only diagonally, others move only short distances in the cardinal directions. When two creatures end up on the same square, a fight commences. Unlike the <em>Super Robot</em> games, these fights are totally interactive action sequences seen from a side view. You must move your dragon to evade enemy fire and try to shoot down the opposition. Each creature has different stats such as speed, jumping height, strength and shot. Depending on the square the fight takes place on, the milieu changes, which can be both a hindrance and a boon for different units.</p>\n<p><em>Akanbe Dragon</em> comes with a level editor for creating your own scenarios, and a continue option is also available if you lose the scenario.</p>",

You navigate your ship through an asteroid field, with a finite fuel supply. From time to time, enemy ships come into view and try to hunt you down. Shoot them down, but bear in mind that each shot costs a little bit of fuel. Sometimes, you will encounter a fuel supply, and strewn throughout the game are powerups which boost your \"flight record\", which is turned to score as you complete a level. As the game progresses, the asteroids change into other obstacles, such as flying saucers, mines and organic blobs which take several shots to kill. Each enemy ship also has its own movement patterns, some hunting you down, some avoiding your shots, and some just bumbling straight forward. </p>\n<p>When you've passed four different fields, you encounter a mother ship. Docking with the ship requires minute precision, or you will crash and die. The ship teleports you to the next level, which is much like the first.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on a special effects movie, Space Camp takes place in space (it says so in big letters on the cover). You guide your spaceship through orbit, avoiding meteor showers, military satellites and other obstacles. The control method is much like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/6716/lunar-lander-variants/\">\"lunar lander\"</a> type games, but in zero gravity, so a quick thrust with the engines will move the ship indefinitely. Since you have limited oxygen and energy reserves, you must pick up oxygen bottles and energy canisters from the space stations you fly past.</p>\n<p>After the vertically scrolling space sequence, you jump out the ship and explore a space station. The control method is the same, and like before, you must keep an eye on oxygen and energy. Apart from said resources, the space stations have hidden treasures hidden below certain panels. Find treasure by gliding across the panels and pushing the joystick button. Certain panels will lead you to hidden treasure chambers. All the while, you must watch out for the space station's guardian, which moves in your direction when you activate your thrusters or press the button. As long as you just glide, the guardian stays put.</p>",

Earth is still putting up some resistance, but is running out of natural resources. It is discovered that the old mining planet of Vestron contains a special kind of crystals which can be substituted for oil. Retrieving these crystals is imperative for Earth to be able to keep on fighting, so you are sent alone to recover the energy source from Vestron.</p>\n<p>The game is made up of two different screens. On the static screen, you fly around in your space suit right above the surface, where crystals can be found. Pick up the crystals while avoiding the Amstradians, which luckily move back and forth in preset patterns. If you run the risk of a collision, you can press the space bar to activate your <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Asteroids\">Asteroids</a> style emergency teleport. This feature should be used only as a last-ditch effort, since you could just as well teleport straight into another enemy. You can travel up, left and right, to travel down you just let gravity do its job.</p>\n<p>After having retrieved the crystals on the static screen, you progress to a scrolling screen which takes you to the next crystal site. In order to get through this screen, you must avoid all the Amstradian ships which attack in a kamikaze fashion. Reflexes are a requirement, since the enemies move very quickly and track all your movements.</p>",

The pyramid is here, unlike many other clones, a proper pyramid, and the bouncy little Fuzzball must jump from block to block, changing its colour, while avoiding the balls that come dropping down the pyramid. After a while, a purple ball enters the game, that ball hatching a dangerous snake that will not just drop down, but can also jump up on the pyramid, hunting the Fuzzball. Outside of the pyramid are discs, which can be used as emergency lifts which drop you on the top of the pyramid again.</p>",

You must control your lady on a journey through an African jungle. Along the road are cameras on tripods for you to look through in the hope of snapping an animal. If you get them on film, they end up in your photo album. The road through the jungle is filled with dangerous animals such as spiders and snakes, and even flesh-eating plants. You must also traverse rivers on small rafts. Since the road is narrow and you lack any offensive capacity, you must look carefully where you tread, or your scantily-clad lady will fall prey to the dangers of the African wildlife.</p>",

The small size of the bat is helped slightly by the fact that there are some walls even behind the bat, where the ball will bounce if you miss it. In the centre of the back wall is still a hole for the ball to pass through, though. As you break down the upper rows of bricks, the back wall will first disappear. One the next row of bricks, your bat will move close to the wall, giving you less time to catch the ball. Breaking bricks even higher up will shrink your bat to the size of only a few pixels. Due to buggy collision detection, the ball will sometimes be reflected from invisible parts of your paddle, and it is possible for the ball to bounce through the gaps between bricks, destroying bricks much further up before bouncing back straight through the bricks further down.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Franciscan monk Noni wants to join the Vitigudina order. To judge his valor, the order asks for a test of virtue: the monk has to collect weapons and use them to exorcise all the demons of a village.</em></p>\n<p>Temptations is a Spanish flick-screen platform game. The game is divided in a series of levels, each with a series of screens. The player controls the monk's movements with the <strong>ARROW KEYS</strong> or the <strong>JOYSTICK</strong>. Pressing the <strong>SPACE BAR</strong> or the <strong>FIRE BUTTON</strong> shoots the projectile weapon he is carrying. The friar is killed if he touches the demons or some of the screen objects. His movement has inertia: after landing on a platform he usually keeps sliding forward (that is something that must be taken on account when planning how to move from one screen to the other). Shooting choice spots on the screen reveals hidden power-ups that can be collected, and some screens require the use of a specific power-up to reach their exit. The game starts with 10 lives and has no form of saving progress.</p>",

        "description": "<p><strong>Nyancle Racing</strong> is a top-down racing game from Japan. The gameplay is reminiscent of the 1983 classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9306/bump-n-jump/\">Bump 'N' Jump</a>. The player controls a vehicle shaped like a mechanic animal on a track filled with obstacles, collectable rolling pieces of candy (the game currency) and other enemy racers. The main objective is to arrive at the end before the timer runs out. The competition tries to delay progress by bumping into the vehicle to steer it off the road. The racers can take flight by passing over some squares scattered throughout the course. Pit-stops (presented as a house with a red sign painted on the roof and a \"IN\" sign painted on the track) are positioned at regular intervals beside the main track. Once inside them, a screen comes up with a choice of two shops where the candy can be spent:</p>\n<p>\u25cf The one on the left is the <strong>Unusual Items Shop</strong>, that sells a variety of power-ups: extra lives, boosts for speed/jump/steering and extra time.</p>\n<p>\u25cf The one on the right is the <strong>Relief Hospital</strong>, where the player can assess the damage and repair the vehicle.</p>",

The player's character can shoot stakes that kill the monsters and stick to the blocks (he can jump on these stakes and eventually break those blocks, clearing the path to the exit door). If he touches any of the monsters or dangerous environments, he transforms into a blue frog and the player loses one life. There are several items that can be collected: some of them are immobile, some randomly float around the screen.</p>\n<p>On the top of the screen there are a inventory of collected items, a timer and the number of lives.

Roger, her fianc\u00e9, hires a young Sherlock Holmes to clear her name and help on the investigation.</p>\n<p><em>Young Sherlock: The Legacy of Doyle</em> is a Japanese adventure based on the movie <em>Young Sherlock Holmes</em> (1985), although it has a completely different plot. Controlling Holmes and Watson, the player must investigate the murder of a millionaire by questioning witnesses and investigating parts of London. The screen is divided in three parts: a window at the bottom for text output, and above it an illustrative picture and a verb list. The verb commands used to interact with the game world are \"walk\", \"examine\", \"talk\", \"listen\", \"show\", \"take\", \"inventory\" and \"use\".</p>\n<p>When the player walks from one place to the other, the picture portion transforms into an overhead map of London where a red square shows the position of Holmes and Watson. The player can move this square with the arrow keys, and position it over an interactive area to access it (the game writes a small description of the places the square touches).</p>",

A bit like <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Q*Bert\">Q*Bert</a></em>, you jump around on stones in the river. Jumping is done by placing a cursor, with limited range, above a stone. If you don't place it right above the stone, you instead jump into the water. This isn't necessarily lethal, since you can jump up on adjacent stones, or you can go with the flow, as long as you take care not to pulled by the strong current into a spot where there are no stones to seek refuge on. It is also in the water that you will catch bananas coming down the stream.</p>\n<p>Bananas are necessary to get rid of the Bocondas; they can be placed on top of stones, and if a Boconda tries to jump at you, they will land on a banana and slip into the river where they are swept away. They are smart, though, so you will need to trick them into jumping onto your boobytrapped stones. Instead of tricking them, you can also swim to the river shore, pick up stones on the shore and throw them at the Bocondas to make them fall off their stones.</p>",

So this is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a>-like maze gobbler.</p>\n<p>Unlike the intricate mazes and smart ghosts of Pac-Man, Smack Wacker is very mechanical. The maze is made up of smaller and smaller squares inside each other, thereby forming corridors. The openings between the corridors move around the edges of the boxes, and the mouth bacteria move singlemindedly around and around in their respective corridors. You tell the false teeth to move clockwise or counter-clockwise in a corridor, or to stop and wait for the opening to the adjacent corridor to pass by. Colliding with the mouth bacteria, which mirror your own movement, doesn't instantly kill you, since you have a power bar.</p>",

        "description": "<p>\"Kinnikuman Colosseum Deathmatch\" is a game based on the manga/anime franchise Kinnikuman, better known in the West as Muscleman. It's also the first video game to ever appear based on these series, and as you could expect, its genre is fighting. A single player must fight past three opponents, after which the game loops. Matches consist of a unique round, health is measured with a energy bar, Up jumps, down ducks, and you can attack from those positions or while standing, and execute a throw (it's also one of the earliest games which allows this). You also count with a risky technique where you jump against the wall, tap the direction towards the wall, and tap attack, making your character bounce off the wall; damaging your opponent if the move connects, or hitting the ground and damaging yourself if it doesn't.</p>",

Armed only with a pickaxe, you must outsmart the aliens and dig holes for them to fall into. Those which fall into the holes must then be pushed through it with the pickaxe. After all the aliens are eliminated, you go on to the next level, but you must do so before your oxygen supply runs out.</p>\n<p><em>Panique</em> has many level variations, interspersed by small animated intermissions. On later levels, the aliens become stronger, requiring several procedures with the pickaxe before being eliminated. The smartness of the enemies can be set when starting the game.</p>",

When you manage to colour all sides of a cell, it is lit up. When the entire grid is coloured, and therefore all cells are lit up, you have finished the level. Of course, there are nasties following you around, so you have to navigate smartly if you don't want to be caught.</p>\n<p>As the game progresses, the speed and number of the baddies is increased, but so is your speed.

You start the investigation at her house, where things take a dramatic turn when her housekeeper tells you that Yoshizawa's assistant and niece, Rika, hasn't left her room for the entire day. As you break the door, you find Rika dead on the floor. The madman has found his first victim...</p>\n<p><em>Shadow Hunter</em> is a graphical adventure game using principles common to Japanese adventures of its age, quite similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Icom\">Icom's</a> adventures such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/208673/deja-vu/\">D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu</a>, where you have a graphical view occupying most of the screen, surrounded by a message box at the bottom and actions on the right. Unlike Icom's adventures, though, you cannot choose a verb on the right and then point a cursor on an object on the screen. Instead, ready-made actions are presented in an ad-hoc manner according to what is relevant to each screen. The game is filled with bad ends \u2013 e.g. if you choose to stay at the hotel, the game is ended because you're wasting time.</p>",

The pieces are not only scattered, they may also be turned upside down. </p>\n<p>As you play the puzzle, your score starts to count down, and the rate of the countdown is heightened when you execute moves, turn the pieces or use the special features which will reveal a glimpse of the finished puzzle, automatically lay out pieces, or halt the animation.

As in the movie, the player takes the part of one-man-army John Rambo who is busted out of prison by his former CO to go deep into the Vietnamese jungle and rescue a group of P.O.W.'s.</p>\n<p>Rambo is controlled from a top-down perspective as he explores the jungle looking for keys and avoiding enemy patrols. The keys unlock the many huts found around the jungle and these must be explored in order to find and release the P.O.W.'s. Gathering weapons and ammunitions is also mandatory, as Rambo's trusty knife is not going to cut it against all those Vietnamese and Russian soldiers.</p>",

When starting the battle turn, the player has four options: fight, use an inventory item, use a magic attack or attempt to escape.</p>\n<p>Certain squares have special proprieties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Town squares have hotels to recuperate or level up health and mana points. Shops have RPG staples like armor, weapons and magical items. There's also a turtle race, where the player can gamble up to 500 gold.

        "description": "<p><em>Rune Master 3</em> is a board game with RPG elements. Up to 4 players compete to reach the final gate, throwing computer dices and fighting monsters. The encounters and battles are random, and when someone is defeated they are sent back to the nearest town.</p>\n<p>The game is turn-based, each player throw the dice and the computer makes the calculations necessary and moves the figure on the board. While traveling, the players might encounter wandering warriors and attempt to recruit them. Successful recruitment increases the player statistics. The players receive gold or level up after defeating the enemies. The battles also use dice throws in turns for each adversary. When starting the battle turn, the player has four options: fight, use an inventory item, use a magic attack or attempt to escape.</p>\n<p>Certain squares have special proprieties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Town squares have hotels to recuperate health and mana points. Shops have RPG staples like armor, weapons and items. There's also a monkey pole race, where the player can gamble up to 1000 gold. Different weapons alter the number of dices and bonus points used in battle. Armor decreases the number of hit points received during fights. The items include health potions, horses that allow faster travel, a book that can be used to set up ambushes for other players (a dice roll sets the number of hits they'll receive) and a scroll that can be used to attempt recruitment of warriors serving under other players.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Squares with chasms can only be escaped if the player throws 6.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The water sludge square can only be crossed if the player throws 1 or 6.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some squares transport the player avatar to another part of the board.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

After the first level the game moves to other wars and presents more difficult enemies to shoot at. In each level the player has to shoot down as many enemy planes as possible to continue to the next level. New levels offer better weapons but more enemies need to be taken out. After a few levels an animated sequence is shown before moving on to a new war.</p>",

When you do get to a stranded airman you release a rope by pressing the fire button or space bar, so that he can climb up to the helicopter. Once he is on board you must fly back to the air craft and drop him off to the ambulance,then do it all over again - there are 25 airmen to collect.</p>",

Each stage is basically a puzzle, where you have to figure out when and where to use the items at your disposal. It is the predecessor of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Toki+Tori\">Toki Tori</a> series.</p>\n<p>At the start of each stage you get a given set of items. You can switch between the items with the graph-button and use an item with spacebar. The teleporter item allows for short range teleports, the materializer item can build bridges across gaps, eggzooka item can shoot eggs at enemies, clone item to clone yourself, the attractor item to attract monsters, electrocuter item to shock monsters, bubzooka item to catch monsters and a bubble item to move through water. Clever use and combinations of these items is needed to solve the more than 70 levels.</p>\n<p>The stages are divided into different worlds, each with a different graphical setting; Forrest world, Bubbels world, Chips world and Slime world.</p>",

The visual design and power-up system are both reminiscent of Konami's well-known title. There is a gauge along the bottom of the screen which increases when a power-up is picked up. Each level of the gauge will activate a different weapon, with the last level switching to another set of weapons. There are three weapon sets in all for a total of nine weapons, including lasers, reflect shots, and 4-way shots; each weapon set also has a \"speed up\" option. Gradius' trademark ship-following \"options\" are also present. Each stage consists of numerous obstacles and enemies which must be destroyed and maneuvered around. At the end of each stage is a large boss.</p>",

The map can be called with the SHIFT key. When used on a MSX Turbo R, the game activates the R800 CPU to prevent slowdowns.</p>\n<p>The gameplay remains the same, where the player must guide the explorer Sabreman through a castle labyrinth, collecting all the ingredients for a potion spell. The daytime cycle occurs every few minutes, turning the main character into a werewolf when the evening starts, and back to human form when the dawn breaks. The remake has a darker, colder palette for night time. The quest must be completed in 40 days, roughly an hour of real time, to win the game and cure Sabreman of lycanthropy.</p>",

You start in front of the dance then must jump over or on bullies. Do not let them touch you head on or you lose a life. Also watch for toy planes that will dive at you. When you are in front of a building, jump at the windows to open them. You must find your father, who will then follow you. Next, find your mother and lead your father to her. They will both follow you so you lead them to the dance. This ends the round. The next round will have more buildings to search and tougher bullies, like some that leap to catch you in mid-air.</p>",

When you have defeated all enemies in the maze, you must return to your house at the top-left corner of the maze. If you take too long to defeat the enemies, a \"walking flame\" will appear and chase you. Also, you have a limited amount of \"air\" which gradually decreases as time passes. If you run out of air you lose a life.</p>\n<p>If your character is captured by an enemy, a \"copy\" of it will appear inside a small \"cage\" at the top-right corner of the maze, and you will restart the level. Sometimes a key will appear, and if you take it, you will be able to set free the \"copy\" of the character and will earn an extra life (that is, you will get that life back).</p>\n<p>After a couple of levels a bonus level will appear. In it you must catch all items within a time limit. If you manage to catch all items, you will earn bonus points.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Due to mysterious circumstances, a flourishing city called Chinese Hill was cut off the rest of the world. Investigators found out that most of the buildings were destroyed, horrifying creatures are roaming the wilderness, and the few survivors have no means of escaping. The SSWAT (Supernatural Special Weapon Attack Team) sends an agent named Laila to the city. The young woman has powerful psychic abilities, which can enhance her firearms, helping her deal with the monsters. She must rescue the survivors and escort them to safety, at any cost...</p>\n<p><em>Shiry\u014d Sensen - War of the Dead</em> is an action game with slight RPG elements. The player navigates Laila over the top-down \"world map\": the ruined city has basically turned into large wilderness areas with a few buildings that are represented by icons on the map and can be explored. Enemies attack randomly. The battles take place on separate side-scrolling screens, and are fully action-based. Laila can jump, duck, and attack with melee or weapons or firearms (which require ammunition). Typically there are several enemies on the screen; Laila escapes the battle if she reaches the end of the short side-scrolling area. </p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to find and rescue the few survivors trapped in the buildings infested by enemies. Laila has to bring these survivors back to the church. Even though the map is almost completely open to the player (especially after Laila acquires a boat, which makes the world fully explorable), the rescuing must be completed in a linear fashion, by talking to characters in different buildings and receiving clues. The game has a day/night cycle; Laila can sleep at any time, which will restore a portion of her health.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Rise Out From Dungeons</em> is a platform game where you must guide an unnamed character through 20 dungeons avoiding traps and red-colored men. The graphics and game mechanics are strikingly similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Lode+Runner\">Lode Runner</a>, but with a twist.</p>\n<p>As in <em>Lode Runner</em>, you must collect several objects all over the level while avoiding red-colored men, there are many stairs and gaps where you fall down if you are not careful. If you fall in the water, you die. You can also destroy blocks by shooting them with your gun. Curiously enough, the \"red men\" can't be defeated by your gun, and they will follow you everywhere you go, only to respawn if they reach a point where there's no way out. There are some elements which look like ropes but they are in fact just a special kind of platform: you can always walk across them safely, but if you land on them after falling down, you will just fall through them, so they actually work as traps. Other game elements include a hidden key used to open a door which leads to the stair leading out from the dungeon.</p>\n<p>The objective in each dungeon is simply to \"rise out\" from them, and that can be done by climbing a stair which passes through the dungeon ceiling.</p>",

However, the color of the mallet changes frequently and the player has to respond to it because hitting a mole of the same color as the mallet will result in decrease of the score bar. If the player is unable to fill the score in time (indicated by a timer bar), the game is lost. There are 9 difficulty levels, with higher difficulty featuring more frequent appearance of moles of the same color as the mallet, thus requiring more attention of the player.</p>",

There's also an experience meter that increases every time you kill an enemy.</p>",

The game is a flick-screen platform game where the protagonist is powerless, but can command Picot to help him. Picot is very versatile; you may walk behind her so that she destroys incoming enemies, you may ride on her and you may give her a push so that she bounces around the screen like a deadly ball. However, Picot is much slower than Jean, and cannot climb stairs. If Jean calls out for Picot, though, she will reach him even if it means clawing her way up against the backdrop. If Jean stands on top of Picot and call for her, she will climb higher and higher, so that out-of-reach places on the screen may be reached.</p>",

On the graveyard, near your mother's grave, you hear a mysterious voice urging you to enter the flooded Greek temple. Naturally, these turn out to be typical <em>Bomberman</em> arenas, filled with destructible square terrain, wandering monsters of different kinds, and power-ups as well as power-downs. In order to progress in your quest, you must bomb your way through these arenas, picking up items that will open the door to the next level. There are several worlds to progress through in this adventure mode.</p>\n<p>In the multiplayer mode, up to four players can play at once, on joysticks and keyboard, in a tournament where the last one standing wins the match, and the tournament is won by the one with most victories. If the match goes on for too long, the walls of the arena start to close in, forcing the contestants closer together or swallowing them.</p>\n<p>The game features many bells and whistles, such as a jukebox in the disco in the village, a map editor and support for modern hardware such as the Moonsound sound module, hard disk support and sampled sound effects.</p>",

As in its source of inspiration, you go around in a labyrinth made out of blocks and populated with monsters, laying out bombs to blow your way through the labyrinth and to kill off the monsters. The power-up system is rather big and unlike that of Hudson, including items that make you invisible, invert directions, slow-downs and most of all money. The standard fare of extra bombs and extra firepower, however, is not so common, and you have a limited amount of bombs to drop. Most levels make use of special tiles such as teleports and tiles that can only be crossed in one direction. The levels have to be cleared on time, and the allotment is so small that a thorough strategy is needed to reach the exit without wasting time on monsters or superfluous bonuses. There are both cooperative and competitive two player modes, and a level editor.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the Nara period in Japan (720-752 AD), there lived a sculptor named Gaou, descended from the mad scientist Dr. Saruta. At a young age, he lost an arm and eye, and was soon ridiculed by his peers for it. Eventually, it proved to be too much, and Gaou became a thief. In spite of his corrupt lifestyle, however, he was able to settle down with a wife - for a while, at least. It all came crashing to a halt over one little disagreement, as Gaou cussed her out... and then killed her!</p>\n<p>Filled with remorse, Gaou chose to repent his wicked deeds, and turned to a Buddhist monk for help. The monk's teachings eventually led him to pursue his passion for sculpting, which led to a series of powerful works renowned for the raw emotions pent up inside him that were expressed therein. But it wasn't enough - Gaou needed to be completely reborn! Hearing about the mystical phoenix, who grants those who drink its blood eternal life, from a fellow sculptor named Akanemaru, Gaou set out on a journey to find the great bird of fire... and hopefully to be reincarnated...</p>\n<p>Based on the \"H\u014d-\u014d\" (or \"Karma\" volume) of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Osamu+Tezuka\">Osamu Tezuka</a>'s famous manga <em>Hinotori</em> (or \"Phoenix\"), \"Hinotori\" is a vertically-scrolling shooting game where Gaou's goal is to locate the mystical phoenix across 6 stages of labyrinths, enemies and various other obstacles. As the game progresses, Gaou can power up by obtaining phoenix plumes to activate special weapons and other items to help him gain abilities such as invulnerability and special shots. In order to reach the final boss and pay a visit to the phoenix, Gaou must obtain a series of keys scattered across the stages - and must even backtrack to find others. The game is over when all three lives are gone - or when Gaou has reached the phoenix's lair.</p>",

Watch out as the fairies of darkness will try to stop you in your journey across the various countries of the world of Magic.</p>\n<p><em>Pippols</em> is a vertically scrolling shooter in which you take control of a lad who navigates what seems to be a garden and shoots hearts at enemies. The screen is divided into five vertical paths by rows of flowers (or other shrubbery and obstacles in later stages). Within the path the protagonist can move freely up and down, but to change the path he needs to jump left or right if there is an opening. You can collect coins and various power-ups as you go. At the end of a stage you can choose one of the branching paths to advance to a different stage.</p>",

The game is very similar to its predecessor. The most notable graphical changes are introduction of smooth scrolling instead of static screens and the ability to choose between regular and roofed stadiums. The game features the same game modes: 1-player single match, 2-player game, pennant mode (playing the whole season), edit team mode and a mode that lets you watch two CPU-controlled teams play versus each other.</p>",

The player doesn't even control Q*Bert, but rather the dragon Wrappy. The gameplay is still focused on forming lines of blocks that match a target color, while enemies constantly enter the playfield. However there are now many different layouts in 50 different stages. Also added are differently colored blobs that function as power-ups when touched. Blue ones for example grant invincibility.</p>\n<p>Another addition are two-player simultaneous modes, where both players compete against each other, with or without enemies.\nThe first player to complete a line of five of his target alignment wins. If the time runs out, the relevant blocks are counted, \na draw leads to a round of rock-paper-scissors with a random result.</p>",

The game is laggy, in particular when wielding your weapon. Enemies in the first couple of screens don't seem to do you any real harm. You can kill them typically with a single hit, and you can even walk over them. Killing enemies gives you experience (EXP), and when your experience bar is full your life bar increases (H.P). After a few screens though the enemies suddenly get a lot tougher and can kill you almost immediately.</p>",

The game can be played in one or two player mode. In single player mode the player competes against a computer opponent. The objective of the game is to be the first player to move all fifteen of their pieces off of the board.</p>\n<p>The typical rules of Backgammon apply. Players roll two dice (if a pair is rolled it becomes four for that turn with the extra two being a copy of the original pair) to move their pieces to an empty slot, a slot occupied by their own pieces, or a slot that contains only one of their opponents pieces. Doing that will send their opponents piece back to their own home base. While it's a players turn, they can take back a move they made.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Maze Max</em> is a racing game similar to the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/19617/rally-x/\">Rally-X</a>. Like in the arcade game, the player is in control of a racing car and has to drive it through a maze in search for flags. There are ten flags in the maze and they all have to be collected in order to complete the level. At the same time, it is necessary to watch out for the AI controlled cars that are pursuing and trying to crash into the player's car. In addition to flags, there are fuel tanks that have to be collected to avoid running out of gas. Crashing into a chasing car or running out of fuel leads to a life being lost and the player has three at the start. After a level has been completed, the player moves on to the next which has one additional chasing car. The main difference from Rally-X is that it is not possible to use smoke screens to distract the cars.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Although it is a variant of the well-known Break-out, there are still some differences; One of them is that Breaker can be played with two bats. One bat is always at the bottom of the screen and can only move sideways. The other bat can move freely around the screen, but can not reach the bottom of the screen. The upper bat is the attacker sending the ball to the desired point, while the other one is the back up. If it is played by one player the second bat can be placed vertically; they always move sideways, only the upper one moves up and down. If it is played by two players each one gets one bat.</p>\n<p>The other difference is the screen layout. Not only the screen is filled with special stones, but also with walls in different shapes that form a maze. Against these walls the ball just bounces, but if there is an opening at the top of the screen, allowing the ball to escape from the screen, the whole screen moves up a bit. While what is at the bottom of the image will disappear, a new piece appears at the top. At the bottom of the screen is the score, game level, the number of balls and the four bonus stones lights. </p>\n<p>There are five different stones; the first one is the familiar, colorful type; depending on the color, it is worth many points or just a few points. The second is the action stone, characterized by an arrow. This one acts like a flipper-bumper and gives the ball a push in the direction indicated to confuse the player. The last is the shrinkage/expansion stone; if hit, the bats become bigger or smaller. You also have the bonus stones in four colors. If you always touch one of the bonus stones of the same color, a light with that color will light up or go out at the bottom of the image. If all four of the same color lights are on, the player gets an extra ball. The special stones causes that the attack bat temporarily disappears. </p>\n<p>In the configuration screen the player(s) can set up the number of players and the controls; joystick, keyboard or mouse. The entire screen can also be moved with the controls.</p>",

But the path to the key and door is blocked by monsters, who do not walk across the field or attack you, such as slimes, ghosts and ogres. To solve this, you must first clear the path by picking up magical objects and use them in the correct order. Each magical objects can effectively defeat a specific enemy only once; Use the Magical Staff on slimes, the Holy Cross to defeat the ghosts and the Sacred Sword to kill the ogres. In the later rounds a new obstacle appears; tiles that only allow movement in one direction. One wrong move and you'll get stuck.</p>\n<p>It should also be taken into account that only one item can be carried each time, and it cannot be dropped. That is why it is very important to make the right decision about which monster you want to defeat with the object that you now have in your possession. Otherwise, you can not grab the next object, because you do not have the right one to beat the monster that stands in front of it.</p>\n<p>In some rounds, instead of picking up keys, you can also rescue women who are surrounded by the monsters. When you take a woman to the door, she will be very grateful. You will then be rewarded with an erotic image.</p>\n<p>An editor is included, where you can make your own rounds. </p>\n<p>The follow-up of the game, \u30b0\u30ea\u30a8\u30eb\u306e\u8056\u676f \u30a8\u30af\u30bb\u30ec\u30f3\u30c8 (The Holy Grail of Griel Excellent) was published in Peach Up Special 1991 and in 2005, a MSX1 remake of the first game, <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/msx/griels-quest-for-the-sangraal\">Quest for the Sangraal</a>\nwas made for the MSXdev '05 coding contest.</p>\n<p>* \u30d0\u30b0\u4fee\u6b63\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0 (Bug fixes):</p>\n<p>This program can fix the bugs of the vertical scroll shooting game \u7a76\u6975\u30d4\u30fc\u30c1 (Ultimate Peach) of Peach Up 3.</p>\n<p>* \u30d4\u30fc\u30c1\u30fb\u30ae\u30e3\u30e9\u30ea\u30fc (Peach Gallery):</p>\n<p>A CG gallery of erotic images of naked girls that were send in by users.</p>\n<p>Disk 2: </p>\n<p>* OUTER LIMITS\u756a\u5916\u7de8 \u30d4\u30b3\u30dd\u30f3\u306c\u3044\u3067\u306c\u3044\u3067\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0 (Outer Limits Bangai-hen: Pikopon Nuide Nuide Game):</p>\n<p>In this game, with the girls of the Outer Limits RPG, you have to compare the outcome of the math problem above your character's head versus the one above the girl's, but if the answer is a higher number than the opponent you can hit her head with a mallet, before she blocks it with a shield.

The player starts with 300 ammunition but must be very careful not to run out of ammo in the later levels. When a next level is reached, the player receives a bonus game if a certain score has been achieved, this score is different per level. After the tenth level, the game starts again with the opponents of the first level.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Duck Hunt</em> is a shooting simulation where the player goes out with his faithful dogs to hunt ducks. It requires the use of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Zapper+light+gun\">Zapper light gun</a>. In game modes A and B, players view a swampland from a first-person perspective. The dog scares the ducks out of the swamp, one at a time in mode A or two at a time in mode B. The ducks go flying around in the air and the player has three shots and a limited amount of time to shoot the ducks before they fly away. Each round only allows a limited number of misses in order to move on successfully. As the rounds progress, the ducks begin flying faster and faster, and fewer misses are allowed. In game mode A, a second player can control the movement of the duck using a controller plugged into port 2.</p>\n<p>Mode C features target practice on clay pigeons rather than ducks. The perspective and rules here are the same, with only three shots to destroy two clay pigeons before they disappear off the horizon. Destroy enough clay pigeons to move on to the next, tougher round.</p>",

I'm sure you'll have all that sorted out by the the time she arrives home...</p>\n<p><em>Pico Pico</em> is primarily an action game set on a single screen which shows a top-down view of you and your \"house\". This is a loose collection of bricks that can be shifted by pushing them or firing into them. Suck spiders start invading from the edge of your property, and you must shoot them before they shoot you. The spider's dead bodies can provide extra material for your house. After the first wave of 30 spiders has been killed, your bride arrives, and you receive bonus points for the size of your house. The next wave of spiders then arrives, but now you must also protect your wife. This can be done by surrounding her with bricks, dead spiders, and \"stoppers\" which you can drop in an empty space in front of you. If you or your wife get shot, you lose a life. After every 30 spiders killed, you receive a bonus, as well as a small amount of time to prepare for the next wave.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Computer Othello is an implementation of the classic two-player board game. The board is an 8x8 square on which white and black tokens are placed. The starting position has two tokens of each colour diagonally opposite in the central 2x2 square. Black then places a token so that there is now one or more lines (of one or more consecutive white tokens) between the placed token and another black token. These lines can be either horizontally, vertically or diagonally, and results in all of those tokens being flipped to black. The same rule applies when white plays to flip black tokens. Players alternate placing single tokens at a time, and must flip a token each turn. Only if no legal move is available can they pass. The aim is to have the most tokens of your colour before both players need to pass.</p>\n<p>This version of othello allows play against the computer, with up to four skill levels. There is also a view button for beginners to show what squares allow legal token placement.</p>",

Having either the time or vitality reduced to zero causes the loss of the game. These can be replenished by collecting various objects scattered throughout the maze.

        "description": "<p><em>Illegus Episode IV</em> is a first person maze game inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=3D+Monster+Maze\">3D Monster Maze</a>. Your task is to make your way out of the 10 labyrinths of the planet Al-Mazar. The mazes are patrolled by robot guards. Contact with the guards is fatal, but they can be shot and killed. Warning of a nearby guard is sounded by an increase in the monotonic humming produced by a detector which you carry. Also within the maze are a variety of objects: gold, food, water and an infra-red viewer. The viewer is useful at night, when the maze would be otherwise invisible in the darkness. Later mazes also contain pits which can be jumped.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Warrior</em> is a top-down dungeon crawler, where the goal is to defeat a dragon in its lair located in the south-east area of the maze. To become strong enough to defeat the dragon, you need to pick-up various power-ups (denoted by question marks) scattered throughout the dungeon. These provide random increases (or sometimes decreases) to various statistics such as Strength, Hit Points, Attack Points, Armour Class and Money. </p>\n<p>At certain fixed squares of the maze, monsters will appear and slowly chase you. If you are caught, you are taken to a combat screen where the battle is automatically played out. Each round of combat uses a point of Strength. If you lose the round, you will be damaged which causes a reduction in Armor Class or Hit Points. You are then given the option of continuing combat. Alternatively, you may win the round and cause some amount of damage to your opponent related to Attack Points. If your opponent is killed, you will usually gain Experience points, although later in the game you will sometimes lose points for a kill.</p>\n<p>The game is lost if your Strength or Hit Points are reduced below zero, but you win if you gain sufficiently high statistics and confront the dragon for the final battle.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ultraman</em> is an action game based on the 1960s Japanese TV series of the same name. In each level, you control forces defending a convoy of military equipment from marauding monsters. The first part of the level involves protecting a ship containing airplanes from flying saucers and sea-monsters. You control an aircraft which fires guns straight ahead when it is in the top half of the screen, and drops bombs when at the lower half of the screen. If you are hit, or if a plane from the ship is beamed-up by a saucer, or smashed by a monster, you lose a life. Once the ship has arrived at its destination, the second half of the level begins. </p>\n<p>The second half of each level consists of a convoy of trucks moving towards the left of the screen, pursued by a giant monster from the TV series (such as Red King, a giant lizard that throws rocks, or Alien Baltan, a purple humanoid lobster-like creature). The progress of the convoy is shown at the bottom of the screen. Again, you start in a plane and can defend the convoy by attacking the monster's legs causing it to trip. Alternatively, you can land the plane ahead of the monster, and activate the beta capsule to summon Ultraman. The game then becomes a beat-em-up, where Ultraman can walk, jump, punch and kick the opponent while your monstrous opponent tries to do the same to you. If the monster destroys a truck, then you lose a life. But once you have given the trucks enough time to reach their destination, you are able to activate your spacium ray which permanently disables your opponents. The levels then repeat until you have run out of lives.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Kid Tawara has discovered the wreck of a ship carrying diamonds. His goal is to find one diamond hidden in a grain bag on each of four floors of the ship, before the wreck completely submerges beneath the waves. Of course, the ship is haunted. Spirit fires drift around the ship, and sometimes manifest as ghosts that will kill Tawara on contact. While the ghosts move slowly, Tawara's movement can be blocked by grain bags and larger spice barrels, which he needs to move before he can get anywhere. On the plus side, Tawara can throw grain bags at the ghosts to subdue them. Each throw costs energy though, and so only a limited number of throws are possible. </p>\n<p>It is also possible for Tawara to explore the decks that are already underwater, but he has only a limited time before his oxygen runs out and he loses a life. On later levels, the submerged decks may be patrolled by sharks. The rise of the water can be slowed by closing the hatches between levels, but eventually the pressure builds causing the hatches to re-open.</p>\n<p>There are a total of four levels of difficulty, and each difficulty has four screens.</p>",

The eggs are dropped by Thunder Pants who are some creatures living in the clouds. Pig Mock has a frying pan with which to collect the eggs, Pressing up allows the eggs to be thrown upwards, and any Thunder Pants hit by a red egg will fall from the cloud, before eventually being replaced. Dropped eggs will stay on the floor, until cleaned up by Uncle Dust-pan who periodically crosses the screen, eating the smashed eggs. After eating enough eggs, Uncle Dust-pan will grow in size and cannot be jumped.</p>\n<p>Each round of <em>Pig Mock</em> is concluded when 15 eggs have been collected. To make matters more difficult, there are mounds on the floor which can cause Pig Mock to trip and become momentarily dazed. Later levels also have a mole which attacks from below the ground. Pig Mock may dispatch the mole by hitting them with the frying pan once they are above ground. Contact with Uncle Dust-pan or the mole, or being hit by an egg will cause Pig Mock to lose a life. The rounds increase in difficulty by changing the number of mounds, the number of clouds containing Thunder Pants, and the tenaciousness of the mole.</p>",

Players control a small unicycled-styled robot who must collect various objects while avoiding four invulnerable tank-treaded robots and making use of special blocks and tiles. The game uses a standard arcade-style high score and life system.</p>\n<p>The blocks seen in the vary in use, ability, and design. While most act merely as walls, some are able to be moved around by the player in simple directions which can used to access parts of the level and trap enemies. Some blocks merely disappear when touched by the player, allowing both them and enemies to access more of the level. Occasionally, a heart may appear out of these either of these blocks which, upon collection, will grant the player a short period of invincibility and allow them to knock enemies out of the playing area. Another feature in almost every level are special tiles that force the player to move in a fixed direction, though can be defeated if a block is placed in front of its directional output. </p>\n<p>The goal is to collect four objects located around parts of each level. While the number objects never change, the theme of each the objects change after every two levels and include food, electronics, letters, weapons, and other forms of iconography. After each level, the player is rewarded with random quotes and anecdotes, all of which have no meaning to the game itself. There are sixteen levels/puzzles in total.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Koi-Koi is a traditional Japanese two-player card game. It is played with the hanafuda, which is a flower themed deck consisting of four cards in each of twelve suits corresponding to months of the year. The aim is to capture certain combinations, known as yaku, using cards played from the hand you are dealt, and picked up from the table. </p>\n<p>Each round starts with eight cards placed face up on the table, and eight dealt to each player. The first player must play a card to the table. If it matches the same suit as an existing table card, then both it and the played card are captured by that player. A new card is then drawn from the deck and immediately played to the table. Again, if this matches, the player captures that card, and it is then the opponent's move. The first player to make a yaku can choose to win the hand, or say \"Koi koi\" to continue the game. If a second yaku is completed before your opponent, you win double points. Otherwise, your opponent wins double points, and a new hand is dealt.</p>\n<p>If no player completes a yaku when their cards run out, a point score is calculated from each player's captured cards and the player with the higher score wins the round and gains a point. The winner of the previous round then plays first in the next round. Play continues for 12 rounds (one for each month of the year), after which the player with the highest score wins.</p>\n<p>This implementation of the game automatically detects when different yaku have been played, and does the scoring for you. It also has only one fairly low level of difficulty for the computer opponent, allowing a novice to win the game even if they imperfectly recognize the cards and can't remember all of the yaku.</p>",

Your position at the top of the screen is slowly being over-run by soldiers, who are creeping up on you from the bottom of the screen, and taking cover behind rows of sand-bags. Once the enemy gets past the final row, they will destroy your base with a grenade, so you will need to shoot them before that happens. You control the cross-hairs of a gun, and must take aim and fire at the soldiers when they are crawling between the sandbags, which is the only time they are exposed. Occasionally, the leader of the troops briefly appears at the bottom of the screen to encourage their troops. Shooting the leader will cause all of the remaining troops to surrender, and the next wave to begin.</p>\n<p>The difficulty increases for the later waves, when the troops start crawling faster, and vehicles will sometimes appear which deliver soldiers closer to your pillbox.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Mr. Chin is a Chinese circus performer who specializes in balancing spinning plates on poles. Each stage consists of three levels with seven poles on each level, and Mr. Chin must demonstrate his acrobatic skills by spinning dishes on all of the poles at once. An unappreciative critic tries to thwart Mr.Chin by throwing cutlery at him from off-stage which he must avoid by either jumping or ducking. The frequency at which these objects are thrown increases for later stages. From stage 4, gaps in the floor appear and move about which will cause the circus star to fall. From stage 10, the levels wrap back to the beginning.</p>\n<p>To set a dish spinning, Mr. Chin must first collect a dish from the side of the screen which he carries this on his head. He then climbs an empty pole, and once at the top the dish is placed and spun. Each dish will only spin for a limited time before it starts to wobble more and more wildly before eventually falling. These dishes can be re-spun by climbing to the top of the pole again. A broken dish is a calamity for the perfectionist Mr. Chin, but he gamely continues his performances, although three mishaps are enough to ruin his career.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>The Stone of Wisdom</em> you play as Leon, who is transported to a mysterious castle and told to retrieve four ancient tablets so he can go back home. After each tablet, you move on to a different part of the castle where the walls and floor are a different colour and the enemies are tougher.</p>\n<p>Your only weapon is a sword, which you use to stab enemies. These don't really attack you but wander back and forth, hurting you when they collide with you. They are mostly what gives the game an Egyptian flair, as you can recognise mummies, sphinxes and the classic hieroglyphic representation of a man in profile, along with some more abstract creatures.</p>\n<p>Special blocks can be destroyed to reveal gems that increase your three coloured gauges: black Intelligence (secret doors open when this stat reaches certain thresholds), red Power (making your attacks stronger) and blue Life (you will lose if it drops to zero). You also need to avoid contact with three types of coloured squares, which deplete the corresponding gauge if you walk over them. You can also pick up orbs, which serve as currency to purchase upgrades that nullify the harmful squares, raise your attack or defence, etc.</p>\n<p>To progress through the castle, you will often need to reveal news paths by destroying walls, and these are not indicated in any way. However, once you know where to look, the game can be completed in very little time.\nOnce you have reached the end, you will be given the option to restart from the beginning, retaining all your items and stats, making the second run through trivial. Once that is done, you have actually beaten the game.</p>\n<p>With its hack and slash and light RPG elements, secrets to be found and sometimes maze-like structure, The Stone of Wisdom is in the vein of 1984 <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=The+Tower+of+Druaga\">The Tower of Druaga</a> and emulates to a degree the dungeons of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3393/the-legend-of-zelda/\">The Legend of Zelda</a>, released earlier the same year, although in a much more stripped-down version, since there are no bosses, no items to use and a limited variety of enemies.</p>",

Not only must you keep to the track, which gets increasingly more narrow and jagged at higher levels, but you must also avoid rock-piles before reaching the finish line. You are only allowed to miss a few flags per level. And although hitting the rocks is not an automatic loss, it does cause a delay. You are only allowed three failures to complete the tracks within the specified time before your game is over.</p>",

From the deep sea to the far reaches of space, it's up to you to fight and make sure Tiar does not fall.</p>\n<p><em>Hydefos</em> is a shoot 'em up with smooth scrolling, a rarity on the MSX, where the scrolling is usually choppy, and a feat developer Hertz had already accomplished on a previous title, action platformer <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8237/psychic-world/\">Psychic World</a>. You pilot one of five ships through levels featuring branching paths, so two play-throughs could be different depending on where you go.</p>\n<p>You have a health bar, and you only die if it drops to zero or you collide with a wall. You can pick up various items that increase/decrease your speed, add guns to your ship (sometimes with the ability to rotate them to shoot up, down or behind you), give you a shield for defense, etc. The environment can also be a hazard, with walls that materialize only when shot and obstacles that need to be shot in order to pass safely.</p>\n<p>You will regularly come across a \"pit stop\", where you can dock to change ships and loadout. You can also choose to bypass it and keep your current vessel. You will have to defeat four bosses before taking on the final one. Interestingly, you do not kill him, but rather catch up to him and capture him while he flees in his own ship.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Lupin III is a cat-burglar character who originally appeared in Japanese manga. The current entry was inspired by the anime \"Castle of Cagliostro\" in which Lupin steals some money that turns out to be counterfeit. He tracks the source of the fake money to a castle, and finds that it is inhabited by an evil count who has kidnapped a young woman and forcing her to marry him so that he can control the Cagliostro fortune.</p>\n<p>The game is a platformer with seven levels, and features many of the same locations that appear in the anime. You control Lupin, and your goal in each stage is to find a red and a green ring, and bring them to a goat's head mounted on the wall to open the secret exit to the next level. In addition to the typical walking and jumping controls, Lupin has several attacks: a short range sword strike, a long range gun shot (if you have enough bullets) and a flash-bomb which is triggered while jumping, and destroys all enemies on the screen. Special items, such as the rings, can be found in niches which Lupin can break open with his sword. Some of the niches are hidden.</p>\n<p>In addition to the rings, there are other items that can be found in niches, or occasionally dropped by defeated foes. There is ammo for your gun, a shirt that gives you temporary invincibility, rockets which can be used to launch a rope to access higher parts of the level, as well as goggles which hinder your ability to move. On some levels, a lady occasionally runs across the screen, and if you have a coin when she runs past, you will receive an item in return.</p>\n<p>Most of the items found are cups. These add to a special slider at the top of the screen, and When you pick up a tea pot, the cup statistic is converted into life energy. Energy is lost by touching enemies, or traps such as falling chandeliers. When your energy reaches zero, the game is over. A password is shown at the end of each completed level, allowing you to start where you left off without having to replay the entire game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Marine Battle</em> is an arcade shooter which pits your destroyer against a multitude of aerial and naval forces. Your ship can move back and forth across the top of the water, and can fire directly upwards at planes or downwards at submarines or the elusive ghost ship whose shadowy presence occasionally manifests itself at the bottom of the screen. Both planes and submarines may fire back at you, and the goal for a given level is to destroy a certain number of submarines before a timer runs out and while avoiding incoming fire. </p>\n<p>Destroying a plane will cause its pilot to bail out into the water, and he may be collected for extra points. Your war ship also has a finite amount of ammunition, and a limit on the number of bombs/shots in the air at any one time. When ammo supply runs low, a resupply ship appears at the side of the screen allowing you to restock. Later levels increase the rate of fire of all of the enemies, and the game continues with increasing difficulty until you eventually lose all your lives.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Crazy Bullet</em> is a variant of the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tank\">Tank</a>. As in that game, there is a top-down view of an arena containing two equally equipped tanks who engage in a fight to the death. Each tank can fire a bullet at a time, and move to avoid the opponent's fire. Contact with a bullet will destroy your tank, earning your opponent a point, and the first player to five points wins the contest.</p>\n<p>The current game has a couple of important differences from the original. The most important is that bullets do not just travel in a straight line after you fire them. They move in the direction in which you last directed your tank. This allows you to fire around corners, and even to shoot yourself (gifting your opponent a free point). Secondly, there are a number of different arenas which can be chosen, with different wall layouts. Some of these layouts also include a turn-style which allows you to pass but stops any pursuing bullets. Finally there are two speed settings (for fast and slow bullets).</p>",

The game is played on a rectangular court with a net in the middle, and a team (each consisting of two players) on either side of the net. Each team's players move in the same direction at the same time, and are separated by a fixed distance so they each control one half of their side of the court. One of the teams starts the rally by serving the ball, and the aim is to hit it into the air so that it lands on the ground on the opponent's side of the net. If you hit the ball out of court, or it falls to the ground on your own side, then the rally is lost. If you are the side serving and you win the rally, then you gain a point. Otherwise, the opponent serves the ball for the next rally. The team that first scores 15 points wins the game.</p>",

The gameplay is reminiscent of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Double+Dragon\">Double Dragon</a> and some of the early <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Technos+Japan\">Technos Japan</a> titles this game is dedicated to. There are several levels. The character's health bar is shown at the bottom. When an enemy is knocked out, he can be picked up and thrown at opponents. The story tells about two dangerous patients who escape from a mental asylum and are out for revenge.</p>",

Your foes arrive from the right of the screen in balloons, and fire missiles at you. By flying into the right spot on the front or rear of the balloon with your beak, you can pop it. If a balloon successfully makes it to the tree with your nest, it will drop a section of ladder. Once three sections of ladder have been dropped, subsequent balloons will drop climbers. These make their way up the ladder and, unless they are knocked off with a precise peck to the back, will take an egg once they pass your nest.</p>\n<p>Popping ten balloons on a levels takes you to the next stage. This resets your power, and clears away incomplete sections of ladder. Subsequent levels have faster and more rapidly firing balloons. The game continues until you eventually lose, which can happen in two ways. You can lose all of your lives, either to enemy fire or by running out of power. Or you can lose all of your eggs to the voracious enemy.</p>",

The rocket moves under the effect of gravity but may rotate about its axis and activate its thrusters to change its velocity. Using the thrusters consumes fuel, of which you have a limited amount.</p>\n<p>A safe landing is achieved if your rocket arrives at the surface within the required area with sufficiently small vertical and horizontal speeds. Hard landings outside of these parameters will result in the loss of a craft, and losing three rockets will end the game.</p>\n<p>The landing positions on each screen have different scores, depending on their difficulty. Successful landings at all five locations clears the screen, and then you start again. There are five skill levels available, with the harder levels having increased gravity and a smaller margin on the speed allowed during landing.</p>",

You can divert the attention of a butterfly by dropping a sugar cube, which it will eat in preference to visiting flowers.</p>\n<p>All of the insects can be dispersed using your sting, of which you have an infinite number, and can launch at your opponents in a parabolic arc. Later in the day, a human bug collector that prizes you as a specimen will appear, and is impervious to your sting. Killing an insect gives you points, as does returning to the hive with nectar.</p>\n<p>Each level takes place over the course of a day, and ends when you have collected a certain amount of nectar (indicated by the number of grubs lying on the ground). On completing a level, you get a bonus for the amount of time left in the day. And then the next level starts, with more enemies and requiring a larger number of trips to complete.</p>",

        "description": "<p><i>Nyorols</i> is a single screen action maze game. You start in a maze, which wraps on the sides and the top/bottom, with two different types of opponent. A red opponent that resembles a flame will move vertically and horizontally along the maze passages, and a purple snake, which can also move diagonally and pass through walls. Touching either of these opponents is deadly, but you can attack them in two different ways. By default, you can create invincible clones of yourself which can wander the maze, or lie down as a booby trap. These clones can destroy the enemy on contact, but will do the same to you if you touch them. An alternative attack is available if you touch one of the crosses on the level. This will toggle your colour to red, signifying that you may now kick when facing horizontally.</p>\n<p>Taking out an opponent will usually cause it to turn into an impassable barrier, which makes movement around the maze more difficult. Sometimes a heart is produced, which can be collected for bonus points. Later levels resemble the earlier ones, but start with a greater number of enemies.</p>",

The main goal of the game is to eat all the candies and avoid the smiling meatballs. If the player is hit by them, all the teeth in the denture will fall out. However, in the far corners are the Corner Candies. This will briefly change the color of the maze and make it possible for a short time to eat the smiling meatballs and move freely through the field. To get bonus points, the player must grab the candy cane that appears every now and then. Once the screen is clear, the player gets a teeth cleaning and moves on to the next, more difficult level.</p>\n<p>It is possible to set the speed at the start of the game by pressing the ESC button. The game can also be paused by pressing STOP and HOME to unpause.</p>",

Each sector, alpha, beta, gamma and delta consists of 50 rooms that have a number of connecting doors. To open these doors, the player must look for the keys scattered throughout the maze. Each key has a different symbol on it. This means that the doors can only be opened with a key with the same symbol. To reach the new sector via the planet's surface one must use the key card that can be found in each sector. Enemies also roam each sector, but these can be shot or avoided.</p>\n<p>There are also objects that can give an extra life, such as an egg, question mark (or refuel) and one green die. However, the green die can add or take away a life. To refuel, the player must find objects such as a fuel tank, cold beer, banana, apple, grapes or a pear. This can also be found in combinations such as the puzzle pieces FU and EL, etc. Only two items can be carried at a time; As soon as a third is picked up, the player loses one of the two items already in his possession. To get information about the object, press the O key. To use object 1, press number 1 and press 2 for object 2.</p>",

Extreme care must be taken in controlling wave action as the boat may capsize in very rough seas. In the middle is the speed and how much fuel there is left. It is important to keep an eye on the wind indicator that is specified by an arrow. This is where the player sees the strength and direction of the wind. At higher speeds, there is the risk of flying up in the air. The bottom right of the screen shows the player's position, how many rounds must be completed and how many laps still to go.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Bounce</em> is a variant of the well-known <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9001/breakout/\">Breakout</a> where the player has to bounce away all the blocks on the screen as quickly as possible. There are some subtle differences from the original game. One of them is that the movement form is not based on controlling the ball using a bat, but on the bouncing effect of the ball Bouncer against the walls that bounce the blocks away. The other difference is that the player(s) can influence the direction of the ball. If the joystick/cursor keys are moved in the same direction as the ball while the Bouncer bounces, it will accelerate. Steering in the opposite direction slows down Bouncer.</p>\n<p>The playing field is filled with blocks. These are different in color with different properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Red - These blocks do not disappear.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Yellow - These blocks only need to be hit once.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Green - These blocks must be hit six times.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Purple - Now the ball can move in any direction, and even be stopped.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Blue - May contain the monsters that is chosen from the ones that are abled. There are eight different monsters. Some will give penalty seconds, an extra Bouncer, or destroy it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The playing field also contains colored lines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Red - Bouncer bounces.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Green - If the ball goes down it will bounce, otherwise it will go right through the line.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Blue - Bouncer comes to a stop.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A two-player mode has been implemented, where each player can take a turn if the other player has lost a life. It also comes with a level editor that allows the player to customize or create their own levels. It is then possible to save them to a disk/tape under one of the Bou.Level names. Then choose a name and press the fire button or space bar to confirm.</p>",

(50 seconds per bomb) By jumping from stone to stone or by climbing or changing ropes they can be reached. The player needs to avoid skeletons, birds, lava, projectiles, barbed wires and other dangers that inhabit the jungle. There are also moving platforms that can cushion the player's falls or make it possible to reach some area that cannot be reached by jumping. The game supports one or two players. If it is played by two players each player takes it in turn when the other player loses a life. Each player starts with five lives.</p>",

The player can also choose to take it easy with \"stay\" or \"drop\" if the card offers no perspective. If a counter-offer has been raised, the player can indicate whether or not to go along. There is then the option to exchange the cards. Then the procedure can be repeated. If the 100 points are taken, the opponent automatically gets it back (another garment).

Players move their fighter ship left and right just off the ground, above a number of pedestrians and shoot aliens flying above, killing people. There is a finite number of enemy ships and a finite number of humans, but players have an infinite number of lives. However, each time you sustain a hit, you suffer a time penalty where aliens roam about unopposed. If all people are annihilated you lose, but if you shoot down all aliens before that happens, you win.\nThe game runs on text-only 80 column mode and uses only text characters and symbols.</p>",

The aim of the game is to rescue injured survivors from the Colombian jungle and return them to base. Enemy planes and helicopters must be shaken off and artillery on the ground avoided or destroyed.</p>\n<p>The upper part of the screen consists of a computerized three-dimensional image and represents the space and the objects traveling through it. The shape of an object is an indication of its condition, such as a circle for a flying object, a triangle for a ground vehicle. The lower part shows the instrument panel. The on-board computer communicates messages from headquarters to the player. It tells you whether refueling, arming or picking up wounded people is necessary. The instrument panel displays all movements (turn, altitude and fore-aft), as well as a speedometer, turbine temperature indicator, two fuel gauges, radar and compass. An identification system tells whether it is an enemy or friendly object. Finally, two options indicate the status of the helicopter and its weapons stock. It is also possible to switch and lock weapons.</p>",

There are four levels in this game. In the first screen Kang rolls barrels towards the player who can smash them with a hammer to gain bonus points. Once the barrels have hit the oil barrel, then \"living\" fireballs must also be avoided.</p>\n<p>The second screen is set in a pie factory and the player must move on conveyor belts and climb ladders to get to Kang. Also the \"living\" fireballs and pies must be avoided. The third screen is an elevator-themed level where the enemies exist of \"living\" fireballs and spring-weights. The last level is where the player needs to remove rivets from girders of a building to make Kang fall down. At the same time, the player must also avoid the \"living\" fireballs.</p>\n<p>Each level starts with a set number of bonus points which counts down over time so the faster the screen is completed the more points are gained. If all bonus points are gone, the player loses a life. Umbrellas and other items can also be collected for bonus points.</p>",

This must be done before the time, shown in the upper right corner of the screen, runs out. Running out of time results in an instant Game Over. The miner machine can push stones in different directions, dig its way through the layers of sand, collect the gold bars and avoid or destroy enemies by slinging the vacant rocks at them. Being hit by a bat costs the player a life. A red rock can be moved aside pressing the firing button/space bar while moving in the direction the player wants it moved. However, this can only be done if there is no obstacle in it path. Although the bats are unable to penetrate the blue areas of the screen (mine dust), the player can. However, if the player has cleared a way through the mine dust, the bats can then move through the pathways that have been made.</p>\n<p>The game features two difficulty levels, each of which contains 25 fields to clear. It also includes a game editor where players can build, save, and play their own levels.</p>",

Once a flooded compartment has been located, the cracks in the floor must be covered with a number of plates found in different parts of the ship. After the player has repaired a leak, it is necessary to pump out all the water that has entered the hold from the ship. These pumps are not in good condition and the robot will also have to repair them.</p>\n<p>To the right there is \"Robot Power\". All the time it will slowly run out. If it runs out, the player will lose a life. To charge the \"Robot Power\", the robot needs to be taken to the power plant. Below the \"Robot Power\" is the course meter, where one can see if the ship is changing course and needs to be corrected, a thermometer where the player can see if the temperature of the engines increases or decreases significantly, the Time and an object window. To select objects, the player must stand next to them and press \"Select\". Finally, there is the water level. That indicates how high the water is.</p>",

        "description": "<p><i>Star Command</i> is a variant of the mainframe game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/91183/star-trek/\">Star Trek</a>. You control the starship Enterprise. Your continuing mission: to seek out and destroy attacking Klimzon vessels before a time-limit runs out.</p>\n<p>The main screen shows two views of this part of the galaxy. The top view is the long range scan, which shows a grid of quadrants. Explored areas and anything within range of the long range scanners are represented by three numbers: the number of klimzons, the number of your bases, and the number of stars. Unexplored regions are represented by hashes. The bottom view is the short range scan, and shows the sectors within the current quadrant. Asterisks are stars, the Enterprise is an E, Klimzons are K and bases are B.</p>\n<p>There are numerous options for controlling your starship. Movement is accomplished by selecting either Warp Drive for long range travel, or Impulse Drive for movement within the quadrant. The course is selected as the angle clockwise from galactic North in degrees, followed by the distance to travel. Landing on top of a base will re-supply your energy, shield and torpedoes, after which the base disappears.</p>\n<p>Landing in a quadrant containing Klimzons will take you to the battle screen. Here, you can select a weapon to fire. Torpedoes require you to specify an angle of fire, and will only cause damage if it collides with a ship. It may take up to three direct hits to take down a fully capable Klimzon war vessel. Phasers can be used to attack multiple vessels. The amount of damage done by phasers depends on the amount of power used, which may be varied. More powerful phaser attacks will deplete your energy faster. You may also move, again by specifying a heading and then moving forwards in that direction. This may allow you to dodge your opponent's torpedoes.</p>\n<p>The game ends when either time runs out, or your ship is destroyed.</p>",

Squares indicate enemy space stations.</p>\n<p>If the chosen location is other than an enemy space station, the player will be confronted with meteorites. Shoot them with the fire button or space bar and aim the laser with the cursor keys or joystick. If a meteorite hits the ship the defense shield is weakened. Should the shield be nullified completely and any new impact is sustained, the ship will be destroyed, terminating the mission.</p>\n<p>If an enemy space station is chosen, the player must first destroy the suicidal Urnuth space fighters in the same way as the meteorites before arriving there. Then encrypted sequence of digits must be deciphered to crack the code.</p>\n<p>Once the code is cracked the player must traverse the Grid. However the entrance to the power core is booby-trapped. A safe passage requires the use of a small supply of \"dummies\" stored in a corner of the hall. If the square is red, it is safe; otherwise it is a booby trap. After taking a safe route through the Grid, the player must now destroy the enemy\u2019s Main power reactor and then escape from the collapsing station cavern.</p>",

        "description": "<p><i> Aqua Polis SOS </i> is a fixed screen arcade game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/66710/lunar-rescue/\"> Lunar Rescue </a>. The undersea city is under attack, and its citizens need to be rescued. You control a submersible that is deployed from a ship, and must descend to the city of Aquapolis, rescue someone, and return to the ship.</p>\n<p>On your descent to the city, you must dodge sea-creatures including several forms of randomly floating jellyfish, whose stinging tentacles will cause the loss of a submersible. There is also a giant sea-horse which will hold your vessel motionless for a few seconds once it is captured. You can activate some jets to slow your descent to help avoid these obstacles, but this uses fuel. At the bottom of the screen, you must then land on one of the buildings and wait for a refugee to board.</p>\n<p>After collecting a refugee, you must return to your ship at the surface. On the ascent, you can fire missiles to clear the path of obstacles. Returning to the surface without the ship nearby will cause you to lose a life, perhaps due to hyperbaric decompression. During both ascent and descent, the city is beset by missiles. You can control the opening and closing of a laser defence barrier to defend the buildings, but the shield needs to be open to allow your submersible to enter. Any missile able to bypass the shield may take out one of the city buildings.</p>\n<p>Each level of the game requires you to rescue five people from the city. Subsequent levels are made more difficult by increasing the number of jellyfish. Any buildings that are destroyed in earlier levels are not regenerated. The game ends when you run out of submersibles or all of the city buildings are destroyed.</p>",

This is not without danger. While trying to penetrate the Dragon's head, the player must dodge the RocketTeeth that the monster drops when hit by the TadpolJectiles. Frequently, the Demented Dragon will drop down a tear which turn into marauding Demon when getting too close. Hitting other objects in the ToothBar (the colored bar in which the RocketTeeth are implanted) could result in temporary malfunctions, such as loss of power or mobility. The exploding Skulls &amp; Crossbones kill the player.</p>",

Down below are nine landing stations each worth between 50 and 150 points. Upon landing on them (which are destroyed on takeoff), the ship picks up a man and has to be taken back to the mother ship. Avoid the meteorites and spaceships, which are blocking the mother ship and trying to destroy the player's ship. Once all the nine men from each landing stations have been retrieved the player can then go to the next level.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Snake</em> is a variation of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Snake\">Snake</a> type of games. The player controls a snake moving about the screen. At the start the snake is very short but grows quickly once it eats the blue (10 points plus one) and purple (20 points plus one) balls until the entire screen is clear. The black and white dots also occasionally appear, which will give between 10 to 100 bonus points. Some green blocks will also appear that should be avoided. Hitting them causes the loss of a life and the level starts from the beginning. Using the fire button or space bar, the player can \"shoot\" to destroy these blocks. (the snake sticks out its tongue). However, each time it is used it will subtract 10 points. The snake starts to accelerate when the cursor or joystick is pressed up and by pressing the cursor or joystick left and right it will move sideways.</p>\n<p>There is an option to choose the level at which to start (15 in total) and the speed.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>747 Flight Simulator</em> is a flight simulator that is instrumental in teaching interpretation of the readings of many panels and the knowledge of the aircraft the player is flying. The runway stretches for miles in front of the cockpit when the signal to take off comes from the tower.</p>\n<p>After loading/booting up the game the auto-pilot option screen will appear, enabling the player to set the parameters of the simulator. The key elements of the simulator are: Thrust control, Pitch control, Gear up/down control and Flap controls. These can be switched on (autopilot on) or off (autopilot off). Now the player can hover the cursor over the selected key and press the fire button. When Continue is touched, the screen shows a Boeing 747 from a side position and the sound of the four Pratt and Whitney engines can be heard until full power is reached.</p>\n<p>A flight instrument panel is also shown. The main instruments are: the vertical speed indicator, showing your rate of climb or descend in 1000 feets per minute; the altitude indicator, showing the distance to the ground in 1000 feet steps, 1 full circle dial sweep = 1000 ft; and the airspeed indicator, showing the airspeed in knots. Next to these instruments, a cathode ray tube display (crt) shows relevant flight information and the flight control computers comment as they occur. Following this display's orders will let the player fly the plane \"on instruments\", in Full Control and at the highest difficulty levels. It is possible to choose autopilot at any time during the game.</p>\n<p>When the Jumbo Jet has touched down and rollout, there is also the option to print-out the flight logbook, up to the moment of aborting or switching off the engine.</p>",

To get out of each room he has to find the clue to the hidden passages and secret stairs and use the keys to open the doors.</p>\n<p>To destroy each enemy, Joe can crush them with a falling block or by throwing a silver ball. By pressing F1 he can throw the silver ball. Special items can also be used to defeat enemies such as a candle against bats, blood flowers and dripping fire or a rosary against the coffin, etc. To collect items, Joe has to walk over them. The player can see at the bottom right of the screen which items are in his possession. There are also switches that can be used by jumping up to reach them.</p>\n<p>At the bottom of the screen, near the score, the upper part of a skeleton can be seen containing a red and quietly beating heart. If Joe has multiple contacts with some monsters, the heart changes color and starts to beat faster. Too much contact with them will lead to a heart attack. And one life will be lost. The player has four lives throughout the game and 100 seconds per room.</p>",

This is done by defeating every opponent with a close range space-Kalishnikov hairline action laserbolted riotgun while trying to get some protection from their bullets. To do this, platforms placed all over the screen serve as both support and shield.</p>\n<p>Both the player and his opponent have energy levels as seen in the upper right of the screen. Each successful shot from the opponent causes the player to lose energy, with zero energy resulting in one life less. Each time an opponent is eliminated, the player moves on to a successive level with a new enemy base (space or land) as a setting. As the player progresses through levels, things become more and more complicated. The enemy will become faster and, in addition, sometimes he will throw some kind of \"mines\" at the player that will take away a lot of health.</p>\n<p>The balloons give speed or bonus points, the red ones subtract energy and the \"pills\" slows down the shot.

At the top right of the screen is a clock counting down from 5000 to 0. As soon as 0 is reached, the player loses a life. The player can encounter many dangers that cause the loss of a life as well, such as hitting platforms, stepping on landmines, getting shot by machine guns, etc.</p>\n<p>It has three difficulty levels and ESC aborts the game and returns to DEMO mode.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Jet Fighter</em> is an arcade action game combined with flight simulation  in which the player pilots a Crusader Jet. He also controls a surface-to-air missile system which is used to protect his own country from  enemy attack.</p>\n<p>The first part of the game starts with the player in his Crusader Jet and the task is to destroy the enemy fighter. This may be done with the Fighter or using the Ground Based Missile Systems. The Fighter and the Ground Based Systems are linked together so it is possible to control either at any time during this phase of the game. Calling the Ground Based Systems replaces the cockpit controls and allows missiles to be fired at the enemy from the ground. When the ground defenses are in use, the player is unable to control the fighter which will continue at its present velocity until control is regained. Likewise, when in control of the fighter, the player will be unable to employ the Ground Based Systems. The player must also avoid satellites and meteorites coming his way.</p>\n<p>The Fighter cockpit shows fuel gauges, radar screen, altitude and speed indicators, temperature gauges and various other instruments. Pressing F1 switches to an overview of the strategic situation on a galactic map. The top of the screen shows the enemy base with the missile silos. The player\u2019s base is at the bottom of the screen. The player's Fighter is shown as a blue triangle and the enemy fighter is shown as a dark blue triangle. Small white dots indicate the missiles that have been fired. A number of meters also indicate the flight altitude of his plane, the enemy plane and indicate the missiles that are speeding through space.</p>\n<p>If the enemy craft is successfully destroyed, the player's fighter automatically goes into warp mode and flies to the enemy base. Here the player must attack the enemy base and blow it up. But if the fighter is destroyed, the player must defend his base against enemy attacks.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Kaereltje leert wiskunde: Wiskunde I</em> is an educational game in Dutch for 12 to 15 year olds that focus on the introduction to analytical geometry: working with coordinate systems and indexed points thereon. The program consists  of three parts: The first part is theoretical introduction, called vectors. In the second part, the player is quizzed about the material from part 1 by means of optional questions. In the third part, the player is tested on the knowledge acquired on the basis of sums. The sums are also of the multiple choice type, with a choice of three answers each time. Then there is  a choice whether a series of 10, 25 or 100 questions can be made. There are three types of sums. Type 1 is filling in the coordinates of a point on a coordinate system. In a sum of the second type, the Pythagorean theorem must be applied. Given the length of two sides of a right triangle, the length of the third side must be calculated. A sum of the third type unites the previous types. Here the distance between two points on a coordinate system must be calculated.</p>",

The object of the game is to unmask the killer from the clues scattered in the various locations. This can be done by first finding the murder weapon that is hidden somewhere. When it is found the player may question the nine characters that he meets in the manor. Each will tell what he or she was doing at the time of the murder, but one of them is lying. In order to question them, type \"QUESTION (CHARACTER)\". When the player knows who the murderer is, he can accuse that character of the murder by typing \"ACCUSE (CHARACTER)\". If all goes well, a reward can be claimed: a fabulous diamond from an Eastern idol, the \"Eye of Miradad\". However, it must be found first.</p>\n<p>The player inputs all actions via verb-noun commands with the keyboard to interact with the surroundings, such as \"GET KEY\" or \"DROP ROPE\". To make things simpler, the first three letters of a word may be used. To navigate through the locations in the game use \"(N)ORTH\", \"(S)OUTH\", \"(E)AST\", \"(W)EST\", \"(U)P\" and \"(D)OWN\". Things can be investigated with \"EXAMINE\" or \"LOOK\". \"INV\" will give an inventory of what the player is carrying. \"HELP\" will give the instructions and \"QUIT\" will end the game.</p>\n<p>Before loading the tape the \"CAPS LOCK\" must be set to ON. It is possible to save the game at any time (\"SAVE\"), but make sure to use a blank cassette. Before the game starts, it will give the option to to load a saved game.</p>",

One day, designer Lola is kidnapped from the fashion show venue he was guarding. Jackie follows her to Hong Kong and learns that a drug syndicate is operating behind the scenes. After tracking down the syndicate's drug factory, Jackie sets out to rescue the girl.</p>\n<p><em>Jackie Chan in The Protector</em> is an action platform game inspired by the 1985 <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/63598/jackie-chan/\">Jackie Chan</a> film of the same name. Each stage shows a single screen with several platforms on which two or three enemies with weapons in hand, are waiting for Jackie. Each enemy has a different attack routine. Some will hit with their weapon while they move, like Benny Garucci, a man wearing a jersey top and bottom wielding an electric saw. Others can perform ranged attacks, such as the knife-throwing Bronx Kid (wears pink with a mohawk), Mr. K\u014d, a nasty looking guy (wears a navy blue top and bottom) who uses a pistol or Kim Taijin (wears a light blue jersey) who throws dynamite everywhere. There is also David Ho who is usually on the upper floor and keeps throwing large boxes. The object of the game is to clear each stage by defeating all the enemies on the screen.</p>\n<p>Jackie is able to move left and right, jump, wide jump, crouch, punch, flying kicks and low kicks. Its also possible to use high techniques such as jumping with a run-up or kicking a wall to change the angle of the jump (as Jackie did in the movie). There are also trampolines and hanging rings on the screen that allow Jackie to reach certain areas, such as the upper floors, that cannot be reached by jumping.</p>\n<p>Jackie has 3 lives and an energy bar that can withstand up to 5 hits.</p>",

The aim of the game is to climb to the top of the zipper without getting hit by the advancing buckle. Don't go too far to the left or right, otherwise the player may fall off. The other dangers are broken teeth and falling sewing material. To avoid the broken teeth and the falling sewing material  the player must jump from one side of the zipper to the other. The player will score 5 points for each successful jump from one side of the zipper to the other and 100 bonus points for each finished stage.

He is so scared of being eaten that he bravely tries to escape from it. When PiPi walks through the maze he leaves footprints, and when the footprints surround a block in the maze, that block collapses. Once all the blocks are destroyed, he can move on to the next scene by slipping in the mouth of the guard dog Bowbow.</p>\n<p>The rattlesnakes in the maze who want to eat PiPi are usually blue. However, by eating bonus items like hamburger, persimmon, ice cream, peanut, or fish, he will be powered up for 5 seconds. During that time, the rattlesnakes turn red and PiPi (turning white) can eat them. He also doesn't have to worry about getting hurt from touching Mendama. Also, if PiPi eats a power bread that suddenly appears, all enemies will disappear for a few seconds. When the time limit is below 50% King Mendama will appear and will chase PiPi.</p>\n<p>PiPi starts with 5 lives. 1 live will be added for 20,000 points.

Your airplane moves at a fixed speed, and may only turn left or right. It can also travel off the screen, with the screen flipping to the new location. A never-ending stream of ships of various types appear from the North and slowly travel South. You can bomb the ships when immediately passing over them, and this will give you points and fuel to continue the attack. Dropping bombs that miss their targets will cost you points.</p>\n<p>There are four different types of enemy. The aircraft carrier is the largest, easiest to hit, and worth the least. There are also battleships, armed with anti-aircraft weapons, smaller naval cruisers and submarines which periodically dive below the sea surface. You will lose a plane when hit by anti-aircarft fire, or when running out of fuel. The game is over once the entire squadron is defeated.</p>",

        "description": "<p><i>Comet Tail</i> is a Snake variant for the MSX. It takes place in a rectangular maze containing one blue and one yellow comet, each consisting of a nucleus and a tail. You control one of these comets, with the other under the control of the computer or another player. The comets are constantly on the move, but may turn left or right. Blue and yellow stellar material appears randomly in the arena. Collecting material of your own colour will allow your tail to grow. Collecting material of the other comet's colour will cause its tail to shrink.</p>\n<p>Every time you collect any material, a timer resets. If you fail to capture any more material before the timer runs out, your tail will also shrink. You can lose a life if you completely decay, or if you run into the maze walls, your own or your opponent's tail. Play continues until you achieve a certain score, at which point an exit opens up in the outer wall, which will take you to the next arena. There are five speed settings and a total of 50 levels with increasingly complicated wall patterns, making it much more difficult to navigate safely.</p>",

        "description": "<p><i> Exchanger </i> is an arcade game spanning two parallel universes, separated by a barrier. You control an exchanger, which is a device made of black and white holes that will suck aliens through a tunnel from one universe to an outlet in the other. The device will periodically change the direction of transfer after a short pause in operation. You can directly control the motion of one end of the exchanger, while the other end is controlled indirectly and may move in the opposite direction from the first end. Each level is initially populated with aliens of two types that have appeared in the wrong universes. Your aim is to send all of the aliens home, using the exchanger, so that the blue aliens are on the right side of the barrier while the yellow ones are on the left.</p>\n<p>If you exchange an alien twice within a short period of time, it becomes angry and turns a red colour. An angry alien will wreck your exchanger if you touch it with the outlet, causing you to lose a life. Later levels also introduce mines which will detonate after contact with either end of your exchanger.</p>",

        "description": "<p><i>Heavy Boxing</i> is an arcade sports game for one or two players. You control a boxer, and can move around the ring and try to punch your opponent. Landing a successful punch will give you energy, as indicated by a bar at the bottom of the screen. Being hit by your opponent, or ducking a punch will cost you energy. A successful punch will have a chance of knocking down your opponent, after which a timer starts. At any time, there is some likelihood that the boxer gets to their feet and the round continues. But if the boxer does not get back up after 10 seconds, then they lose the game by knock out (KO). A KO will also occur if one of the players loses all of their energy.</p>\n<p>Absent a KO, the game will continue for 12 rounds of 90 seconds each. The players regain some of their energy at the end of each round. After all rounds are completed, the game will be adjudicated by the number of hits landed.</p>",

        "description": "<p><i>Pai Panic</i> is a Mahjong themed single screen action game. You play as Jankiki-kun, who is a creature with a hammer. A row of Mahjong tiles starts to appear from the left of the screen. By hitting the ground above a tile, you can knock it onto your rack. If the tile lands on-top of an already placed tile, then it replaces the previous one. Your goal is to collect a full Mahjong hand before the tiles run out. This typically consists of four melds (three of one type, or a run of three consecutive numbers of the same suit) plus a pair.</p>\n<p>While you are playing, obstacles bounce around overhead. Depending on the level of difficulty, there may be one or two bouncing dice, or spinning point sticks that can only be avoided by jumping over them. If you are hit by anything, you are temporarily stunned. Hammering a button on the right of the screen will sort all of your tiles, allowing you to more easily assess your hand. Pressing the \"ron\" button on the left will complete the level if you have a valid hand. Otherwise you lose a life.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Little Acorn</em> is a cute single-screen action game by Taito that would not have looked out of place in the arcades but was exclusively released on the MSX.</p>\n<p>Starring Sweey, an egg-like hero in red trousers, it needs to clear a magic garden of Peepas, cloud-like creatures who dwell the screen.\nPeepas can be killed by throwing acorns at them, the novelty here is throwing requires energy. Spinning from left to right very quickly fills an energy gauge; The more energy is build up, the further an acorn is thrown.\nWhen a Peepa is hit, it will smash into a wall, destroying anything in its path.</p>\n<p>Acorns can bounce off walls and boxes so you can use it as a tactical advantage to score extra points. But beware, you can get hit by your acorn that will cost a life.</p>\n<p>Peepas come in six colours, each behaving in a different manner. The most notorious ones are Red Peepas who split in two when hit and Black Peepas who fiercely hunt Sweey when it does not clear the screen fast enough.\nAnother foe that sometimes pops up is Merimeri, a grey rubber ball-shaped creature that does not chase Sweey but is lethal on contact.</p>\n<p>An extra life is awarded at 40,000 points, with other extra lives at 80,000 points.</p>",
