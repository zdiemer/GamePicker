        "description": "<p>An electric plasma grid has left New York in a state of chaos, and only Spider-Man can save the city from total destruction. Responsible is the terrorist organisation HYDRA, which also sent out machines (similar to Gargoyles) into the city.</p>\n<p>The game features side-scrolling action in which Spider-Man has to take on various enemy types which want to kill him. Besides the usual range of melee kicks and punches, he also sticks to walls and uses special attacks based on his web fluid. Creating spider web \"vines\" are used to swing from building to building; either required to cross gaps or simply to progress faster in the levels. Every use of his fluid decreases a  web bar which, just like health, is refilled by picking up items floating in the game world. The first goal of the game is to rescue the superhero Daredevil, who then continues to help Spider-Man out: after activating the associated special attack, Daredevil covers the screen with his attacks.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Knuckles Chaotix</em> is a spin-off of the Sonic the Hedgehog series of Genesis games. The starring character in this title is Knuckles the Echidna, who first appeared in Sonic the Hedgehog 3. Knuckles works at Carnival Island, an amusement park. It's his job to protect the park and make it a happy place for visitors. Dr. Robotnik, as usual, has an evil plan for the park. He wants the power emerald which supplies electricity to the entire island. What's worse, he has imprisoned several of Knuckles' friends in the \"combi confiner.\" This contraption only allows Knuckles to free one of his friends at a time be attaching a tether between himself and them. Therefore, when you play the game you are always attached to another character.</p>\n<p>Although the basic gameplay of Knuckles Chaotix is similar to the Sonic games, the bungee cord between the two characters creates new challenges. The new characters that appear are Vector the Crocodile, Mighty the Armadillo, Espio the Chameleon and Charmy Bee. There also two characters whose sole purpose is to slow you down, Heavy the Robot, and Bomb. Chaotix adds several new power-ups and 3D bonus levels as well.</p>",

The resulting chaos caused the barge to crash into a military cruiser. The impact caused extensive damage to both ships. There were only 8 survivors, 4 from each ship. What's worse, there's only one escape pod. You control one of the 8 survivors, and have to finish off all the others to escape with your life.</p>\n<p>The gameplay in Cosmic Carnage is similar to Street Fighter 2, but with a much slower pace. Some of the fighters can be customized with different armor combinations, allowing them access to different special moves.</p>",

Although war has been averted, terrorist cells around the world threaten the stability of the federation. To combat this menace, the Federation has created a bi-pedal armored tank known as the Metal Head. You are a Metal Head pilot, and you have to use all the weapons at your disposal to take out the terrorists.</p>\n<p><em>Metal Head</em> is a bit of a variation on the usual giant robot combat game. The game's mission areas bear more resemblance to a first-person shooter than a simulation. The graphics are all rendered in texture mapped polygons, which is unusual for a 32X game.</p>",

The graphics consist of a diagonally scrolling playfield which creates a pseudo 3D environment. The backgrounds are drawn using 2D scrolling planes, but the enemy and ship objects are drawn using 3D flat-shaded polygons.</p>\n<p>Although the basic goal of each of the 9 levels is to shoot everything without getting shot, the game has a strategic element. Your basic spacecraft has very little firepower, and can only sustain one hit. To make matters worse, there are very few power-ups. In order to survive, you have to jump on top of enemies and take control of their weapons systems. This system allows for a large variety of player-controllable ships.</p>",

        "description": "<p>One of the last 32X games released (and exclusively in Europe), <em>DarXide</em> is a 3-D space shooter, inspired in part by the arcade gameplay of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Asteroids\">Asteroids</a>. It is one of the few 32X games to used texture-mapped polygons. </p>\n<p>Players control a lone starship rushing to destroy oncoming asteroids and alien vessels before they annihilate defenseless human miners and colonies. Asteroids break apart into smaller rocks, which much also be hunted down and destroyed. Aliens likewise arrive in larger, more dangerous vessels.</p>\n<p>Asteroids broken down to their smallest size and then vaporized will sometimes drop shield or energy recharges, to repair damage caused by laser blasts or collisions. New weapons can also be found. Players have a time limit to meet all objectives in a stage before they are forced to land and try again. The right side of the HUD shows asteroids remaining (and their approximate size), while the left shows the player's distance to their base (and so, time remaining in the stage).</p>",
