After both Grunk and his quarry fall into an underground shrine, Grunk must catch the pig and get back to the outside world. </p>\n<p>The game plays like a classic, if short adventure, with several puzzles to be solved and clues abounding. The game's unique characteristics include the narrator's (Grunk's) Hulk-like speaking style, as well as a NPC who can be asked about a huge variety of topics and who reacts to the player's activities in his presence.</p>",

But the doshery lutt is crenned with glauds.</p>\n<p>Glauds! How rorm it would be to pell back to the bewl and distunk them, distunk the whole delcot, let the drokes uncren them.</p>\n<p>But you are the gostak. The gostak distims the doshes. And no glaud will vorl them from you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The player's commands must be entered in this odd language, as well. The main challenge, then, is figuring out the meaning of Gostakian vocabulary from context, possibly with a lot of note taking. Even then, the meaning of some words, and the exact nature of the setting, remains ambiguous throughout the game.</p>",

After your first death, you wake up in a beach house of decidedly more modern trappings wherein you meet a number of your own alter egos (i.e. other unnamed adventurers who have also died in the Nameless Quest) and now find themselves in the titular \"Endless\" part of the game's title. The player must then figure out how to navigate back to the Nameless Quest for another attempt at completing a feat of strength, winning the affections of a sorceress, and killing the dragon.</p>\n<p>As a Z-Machine game with a .z8 filename, the game features a few bells and whistles, such as colored text and backgrounds in select areas.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Savoir Faire</em> is a text adventure in which you are Pierre, the adopted son of a wealthy Count in 18th century France. You are wearing a dashing hat, and carry a sword (inside a swordstick) and a snuffbox. As a member of the nobility, you also have the magical talent known as the Lavori d'Aracne which will let you create magical links between similar objects. Unhappily, you desperately need money. You returned to your childhood home, hoping to ask the Count for help, but no one knows where he's gone. Maybe there's money or something you can sell from the estate. You begin your hunt for treasure from the kitchen garden.</p>",

Counterfeit Monkey's clever twist is that the player starts out with an item that can remove letters from words to change them into something else, a mechanic which many of the game's puzzles employ.</p>\n<p>Emily Short says that the game started out as a thought experiment based on one particular puzzle from the game Leather Goddesses of Phobos, where the player can use a t-remover. She took the idea of the puzzle and expanded it into a fully fledged setting where changing reality by language manipulation is commonplace, and turned it into a game where almost every puzzle is based on the idea.</p>",
