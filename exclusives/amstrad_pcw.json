Aliens move across the screen back and forth while dropping projectiles at the player who has to shoot them down before they reach him. By destroying them all the game progresses to the next level.</p>\n<p><em>Munch It</em> is a variant of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/138/pac-man/\">Pac-Man</a>. It works just like the arcade game with the player controlling the muncher through a maze while eating all the dots. Ghosts chase the player but by eating power pills the player can go after them for a short while. </p>\n<p><em>Hopp It</em> is a variant of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1540/frogger/\">Frogger</a>. Like in the original arcade game the player controls a frog that from the bottom of the screen has to cross a road and a river and reach the top of the screen while avoiding getting hit by a car or drowning in the river.</p>",

In the first one the player has to climb up a scaffolding while avoiding rolling barrels and fireballs while in the second the ape throws barrels directly at the player.
