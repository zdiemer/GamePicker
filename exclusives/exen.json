        "description": "<p><em>Crazy Cobra 2</em> is a Nokia snake clone for ExEn technology.\nIt is a top view very simple game where the goal is to eat pills. But this game is much more interesting since it adds a big number of bonuses to the original game. On the map, you can find presents containing bonuses, but the only problem is that you never know what you will find in it. You can find time pills, tail cut pills (reducing the size of the cobra), but also reverse pills (exchanging the head and the tail of the cobra) and slow down pills, speed up pills and control inversion pills.\nThe goal is to eat all the pills of a level in the minimum amount of time without eating your tail of eating obstacles.\nYou will play inside 30 different levels with 5 different environments.\nUse 2, 4, 8, 6 to control your cobra.</p>",

The sequel adds new things like the capability to turn your ball into a bubble that will be able to fly over holes but will explode by touching walls.\nThis game is still a action/arcade game where your goal is to lead a ball inside levels without falling or being destroyed by enemies and collecting bonuses and points.\nManage your life bar and never let it decrease to 0 otherwise you will die immediately.\nDo not forget to go inside shops to buy important bonuses and power-ups that will help you to finish the game.\nThe game is composed of 25 levels within 3 graphic environments.\nThe graphic artist changed to bring his own personal touch.\nYou control the ball using 2, 4, 6, 8 (or the phone DPad).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>I.F. Ski Jumping</em> is a game where the goal is to become the most famous Ski jumper in the world and beat the biggest champions.\nYou can play one of the 4 different characters with different skills and you will be taught how to jump by an old very famous jumper now retired. He will provide you all the help you need about technique so that you can upgrade your level during each jump.\nDuring each phase you will face a new opponent, each time more powerful.\nThe game is pretty simple. Before jumping, control your stress by pressing the ok button when your power gauge reaches the maximum.\nThen control the player so that he stays on the track (with the keys left and right of the Dpad or 4 and 6). Then press fire at the right time, when the jumper reaches the end of the track.\nWhen in the air, control the balance of the player (disturbed by the wind) by pressing left and right, then press 5 to land.\nAfter a jump, you will earn points thanks to the distance you did.</p>",

When they join one with another, they glue themselves and create a new resulting bigger enemy that will require more than one hit to kill. So avoid them from meeting each others or your mission will become more risky.\nPlatforms are placed all over the levels (creating paths for the enemies) and you can use them to climb and pick up bonuses that will fall during each level. Some of them only give points but a special one allow Pikubi to throw flames in front of him.\nThe gameplay is very simple, use 4 and 6 to move left and right, 8 to jump and 5 to punch.</p>",

The fighter is followed by old planes trying to shoot him. Avoid their weapons and kill them in order to go from one time period to another. To do so, empty the enemy kill gauge and kill the boss of each level.\nIn the meantime, enemies will throw bonuses that will give you points, beware of catching them.\nThis game is composed of 10 levels and you will face a lot of different enemies from old biplanes to future flying saucers.\nThis game is a Time Pilot clone where you just have to shoot enemies.\nUse 4 and 6 to rotate your plane. The autofire is on, you have nothing else to do.</p>",

You will therefore play against each of those character and will earn points depending on the time you spend to defeat them and the number of cells you own at the end of the level. Once you've defeated your current opponent, the next level is unlocked and you can progress in your adventure and reach an age closer to ours.</p>\n<p>Along with the adventure mode, you will be able to play 2 other game modes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quick-game that will allow you to face any already faced opponent.</li>\n<li>Challenge mode where you will be able to play one of the 4 difficulty level in 16 pre-generated maps in which you will have to win a specific match.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Along with this mode you will have a totally random mode that will allow you to play in random situations with a randomly filled board. The goal will still be to defeat the opponent by having more cells than him at the end of the game.</p>",
