        "description": "<p><em>Wave Race: Bluestorm</em> is a sequel to Nintendo's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3541/wave-race-64-kawasaki-jet-ski/\">Wave Race 64</a>. It incorporates several modes of play, a variety of racers, customization options, and tracks. Players can race in four tournament cup series, compete in time attack mode against the best track times, compete for points in stunt mode, and simply take in the eye-poppingly beautiful graphics in Free Roam mode. Multiplay is supported in Stunt and Race modes. There are a total of eight racers to choose from, each with a different balance in engine and handling. Customization is limited, but players can change the color of their racer, optimize the engine for either acceleration or speed, and optimize handling to be either tight or loose. However, settings have little effect on the racer's actual performance.\nThere are eight different courses, however, there are a total of 19 racing tracks laid out across these courses, plus one stunt track for each course. Also, there are five different weathers, consisting of Sunny, Partially Sunny, Light Rain, Rain, and Stormy. These weathers can have dramatic effects on tracks, making a track raced in Sunny weather totally different when raced in Stormy weather conditions.\nThe AI is fairly well balanced, but will cheat to stay with a player.</p>",

Instead of knocking your opponent's health down, you knock him or her out of the battle field. You choose from the wealth of Nintendo characters like Mario, Bowser, Yoshi, different Pok\u00e9mon, and even Link and then either fight through the single-player portion, featuring modes like Classic, Adventure, and Event Mode or battle it out with your friends in a four-player frenzy. More characters and stages are unlocked as hidden objectives are met, and coins rewarded for playing in all modes can be spent on a capsule toy machine. The toys in the machine represent games from Nintendo's entire video game history, and each can be viewed in 3D with a brief description. Also, with the simplified fighting controls, it's pretty easy for even your non-gaming friends to just pick-up and play.</p>\n<p>Playable characters come from the following games:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/890/game-watch-series/\">Game &amp; Watch</a> (Mr. Game &amp; Watch)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/574/donkey-kong/\">Donkey Kong</a> (Donkey Kong)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7301/mario-bros/\">Mario Bros.</a> (Mario, Luigi)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7298/super-mario-bros/\">Super Mario Bros.</a> (Princess Peach, Bowser)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7303/metroid/\">Metroid</a> (Samus)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3393/the-legend-of-zelda/\">The Legend of Zelda</a> (Link)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8544/ice-climber/\">Ice Climber</a> (Ice Climbers)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6116/dr-mario/\">Dr. Mario</a> (Dr. Mario)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Fire+Emblem\">Fire Emblem: Ankoku Ry\u016b to Hikari no Tsurugi</a> (Marth)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=F-Zero\">F-Zero</a> (Captain Falcon)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Super+Mario+World\">Super Mario World</a> (Yoshi)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5335/kirbys-dream-land/\">Kirby's Dream Land</a> (Kirby)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6629/star-fox/\">Star Fox</a> (Fox, Falco)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6676/earthbound/\">Earthbound</a> (Ness)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pok%C3%A9mon+Red\">Pok\u00e9mon Red</a>/<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pok%C3%A9mon+Blue\">Blue</a> (Pikachu, Jigglypuff, Mewtwo)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3549/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/\">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> (Young Link, Princess Zelda/Shiek, Ganondorf)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pok%C3%A9mon+Gold\">Pok\u00e9mon Gold</a>/<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pok%C3%A9mon+Silver\">Silver</a> (Pichu)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Fire+Emblem:+Fuuin+no+Tsurugi\">Fire Emblem: Fuuin no Tsurugi</a> (Roy)</li>\n</ul>",

As the Fog approaches the kingdom of Argwyll, its king embarks on a journey to find a way to stop it - a journey he does not return from. His daughter Katia finds a powerful runestone, which grants her the magical ability to summon and control monsters. Armed with this new power, Katia sets off to find out what happened to her father, and ultimately what can be done to stop the impending catastrophe.</p>\n<p><em>Lost Kingdoms</em> is an RPG with a somewhat unusual card-based battle system. Katia cannot fight herself; the fighting is done by monsters she summons. The battle process is done in real-time, like in action games; the player must be quick to navigate Katia away from danger and summon the monsters. Monsters of various types are represented as cards. When the player chooses a card, the monster will appear and perform an attack. Depending on the card type, the monster will just perform a quick attack, replace Katia for a while, or even stay on the battle field until defeated. Katia receives new cards upon defeating enemies; she can also subdue monsters and turn them into cards as well. Special shops will sell new cards and make new ones out of the old ones Katia can offer to them.</p>",

To do so, he must use his bombing abilities to blast his way through mazes filled with crazy enemies and hidden secrets. There are 5 worlds in all, each with 16 levels to complete. And after completing certain objectives and picking up items, Bomberman will learn new techniques and abilities to improve his range with his bombs or use new weapons.</p>\n<p>Also included is a 4 player classic Bomberman multiplayer modes.

From time immemorial the forces of evil from beyond have been trying to manifest themselves in our world, and it is only through the actions of these forgotten heroes that the world has been saved from being overrun. Chapters take place in Ancient Rome, Persia, the Middle East, and modern-day Rhode Island. Throughout the game, the protagonists will have access to several weapons appropriate for their era, from bastard sword and gladius to flintlock pistol and shotgun.</p>\n<p>The game features an involved Magick system, which allows different spells to be created through the combination of runes. These spells can attack enemies, dispel illusions, and heal both the body and items.</p>\n<p><em>Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem</em> also has a unique feature called Sanity. If an enemy sees a character, their Sanity meter drops. When Sanity gets low, hallucinations begin to plague the character. Walls bleed, voices whisper from nowhere, the camera gets disoriented. Sanity can be restored by dealing a finishing move on a dying enemy, or with spells or some items. Aside from this, characters also have health and mana meters.</p>",

Upon arrival, however, they discover the island has been polluted causing its energy source, the Shine Sprites, to disappear. The culprit is similar in appearance to Mario, who is blamed for the mess, so the portly plumber is forced to clean up the island. Mario is given an invention called FLUDD (a backpack with several water nozzles) to help him clean up graffiti and mud and capture the real villain. Gameplay features a combination of action and puzzle solving, with numerous stages and multiple episodes to each stage, and plenty of hidden secrets and surprises.</p>",

It is now up to Fox McCloud and his team to save the planet and destroy the evil army.</p>\n<p><em>Star Fox Adventures</em> breaks away from the previous games in the series, being an action game with light puzzle-solving elements, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3549/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/\">Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>. You control Fox McCloud as he adventures through Dinosaur Planet, but at the beginning, you control the female fox Krystal, whom McCloud must later rescue. There are missions where you use your trusty Arwing craft, but the majority of the game takes place on foot.</p>\n<p>Helping you throughout your adventure are your trusty sidekicks; Peppy, Slippy, and ROB the Robot, who guide and give you mission briefings. To aid Fox throughout the game, a variety of weapons and magical items are available from blasters to grenades to magic staffs. You may also purchase items with \"scarabs\", the game's currency. Throughout the game you may partake in various mini-games, which are found at different stores.</p>",

Part board game, part arcade style action, the object of the game is to collect the most stars (or coins) from the game board by the end of a set number of turns. Between each turn the players compete against each other in mini games to earn coins which can be used to buy stars or other useful items. The mini games can be played two against two, one against three, or every player for himself.</p>\n<p>Game options include: Party mode (up to four players can compete against each other), story mode (one player goes against the computer), and mini-game mode (any of the mini games unlocked so far can be played.)</p>",

Two young pirates, Vyse and Aika, encounter on their journey a mysterious young girl named Fina. They decide to accompany her on her quest to gather six moon crystals. But it appears that Fina was not the only one looking for those crystals. The evil Valuan empire, lead by an ambitious warlock Galcian and his admirals, will do anything to stop Fina and her brave friends...</p>\n<p>The gameplay is largely based on world-map traveling (always in an airship), visiting various countries, and fighting in two modes: traditional party-based combat, and ship battles, where you control an entire ship and assign commands for four turns.</p>\n<p>What's new in this GameCube re-release? Graphics have been improved (especially character graphics), there are new sub-quests, and new characters with background stories which tell us more about the past of the game's heroes.</p>",

Wario can also grab certain items and enemies and whirl them around him and then release them into more foes, causing even more carnage.</p>\n<p>Defeating enemies yields Wario coins, and he can grab these to purchase health and bonuses. If there's too many coins to grab in an area, you can press L and Wario will inhale the coins to collect them instead. Also tucked away within the levels are Spritelings, caged creatures which offer Wario hints when freed.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The world is enveloped in a poisonous vapor. Anyone who comes into contact with it must die. But humans have learned to develop a technology that would help them to protect themselves from the deadly vapor. The light of Crystals shines in small villages and in large towns. But those protective Crystals have to be refilled every year with the purifying Mana Water, otherwise, their energy will extinguish. Every year, villages send four youths to retrieve the Mana Water that is hidden deep in dungeons and dangerous caves. </p>\n<p>Sounds like the story of the first <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7313/final-fantasy/\">Final Fantasy</a>? The plot of this first <em>Final Fantasy</em> game for a Nintendo console since <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/180087/final-fantasy-vi/\">Final Fantasy VI</a> goes back to the roots of the series, but the gameplay has changed a lot. <em>Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles</em> is an action, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/596/legend-of-zelda-series/\"> Zelda</a>-style RPG. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses one of the four available character classes: magic-using Yukes, thief-like Selkies, gentle-natured Clavats, and cute little Lilties. The game can be played with the chosen character in single-player mode, or, using the GBA-GC connection link, played with three other people, each controlling their own character.</p>\n<p>Each character has both armor and a weapon that can be replaced by crafting a new one with the appropriate items in towns. Found in each monster-filled area are artifacts that raise statistic points until the end of the area, and upon completion one artifact can be kept to raise that stat permanently. In a multiplayer game, players will be given secret objectives, and by completing their objective they have a chance at claiming first dibs on artifacts at the end of the area. Spells are also found in combat areas, though they can not be taken out of them. If spells are placed next to each other in the quick select list, or cast near each other in a multiplayer game, they will merge and become a more powerful spell. Finally, in single-player mode a moogle will take care of holding the \"bucket\" that pushes away the toxic miasma around the party, but in a multiplayer game, one of the players will have to take up this ignoble task.</p>",

The courses also follow the tradition with each one being faithful to the Mario universe.</p>\n<p>This time there are two racers per kart. Much of the game's challenge lies in determining when to switch places in the kart. This game supports multiple players. Therefore, one can team up with a friend on the same kart and take on the opponents cooperatively so that one player can drive the kart and the other can use power-ups. There is also a comprehensive LAN mode, allowing up to 8 GameCubes to be connected together.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This is the fifth entry in the Mario Party series and features similar gameplay as its predecessors. Up to four players compete on one of six game boards in an attempt to collect the most stars by the end of the game. Stars are placed one at a time on the game board, and the first player to reach a star may purchase it for coins. Coins can be earned by landing on certain spots on the game board, by winning the mini games which take place between turns, and occasionally by landing on an event space. Mario Party 5 features over 70 new mini games, features new characters you can play as (such as Toad or Boo ghost), and new bonuses can be found to help you out or bring misfortune. In addition to the standard party mode, several other game variations are included: story mode where one player competes against Bowser and the Koopa Kids, mini game mode where you can play any of the unlocked mini games, and super duel mode where two players can battle each other.</p>",

Gento Matsumotos serene and surreal portrait of wilderness lost then civilization reverting (or progressing) to wilderness. Of course, the most obvious thing about Cubivore would be the graphics. 99% of all scenery and creatures in the game are made of cubes, rectangles, or squares. Even water ripples away from a falling step in squares. Blood pools in squares upon the ground and even the moon and sun appear as cubes in the sky. </p>\n<p>As you move through the game you will eat prey (Or sometimes outfight a predator) To gain new forms and power. The more forms you gain the more wilderness goes back to the land (This wilderness has recently been stolen by a rather nasty Killer cubivore). Naturally, it is your goal to dethrone this killer of the wild and set your self up as king of the beast, thus filling the land once again with wilderness.</p>",

Filming is done in the toon world and then sent to the real world for editing and production, thus reducing the tedium and cost of animation. However, the animation industry is under heavy pressure from new computer-generated techniques of animating. In an effort to revitalize traditional Cel animation the real-world Studio SPUMCO will be creating a cartoon based on Extreme Skating. And so auditions begin in the Toon World.</p>\n<p>The cast of characters are all Cel-Shaded and mostly anthropomorphisms. You will control one of them through eight large sets to try and be selected for the cartoon. You collect points by doing what you would do in any skateboarding game, grinding, jumping, the usual ticks. However,  here there is a twist. Seeing as you are a cartoon you can gain points by being beheaded crushed and other familiar animated antics. Sometimes a level will consist of a battle or a race.</p>\n<p>The game also contains a two-player versus mode.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Twin Snakes</em> is a remake of the 1998 tactical espionage action game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Metal+Gear+Solid\">Metal Gear Solid</a>.</p>\n<p>The remake has the same story and dialogues as the original (although voice-overs were re-recorded for this release). The locations in the game also remained the same, but the graphics were updated to look equal in quality to contemporary games. Gameplay was also enhanced, featuring the additions that first appeared in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5211/metal-gear-solid-2-sons-of-liberty/\">Metal Gear Solid 2</a>. Snake can now roll, hang from ledges, hide in lockers, drag guards' bodies away, as well as aim and shoot from first-person view. New weapons from <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> (such as tranquilizer gun) are also present. </p>\n<p>Another noticeable change is in the game's cutscenes. Directed by the Japanese action movie director <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/134687/ryuhei-kitamura/\">Ryuhei Kitamura</a>, the cutscenes have been re-worked, featuring dramatic techniques used in action movies, such as slow motion and other effects.</p>",

This new discovery leads to the colonization of Ragol 2 and the birth of a new faction (calling themselves the Arkz) who oppose the government's actions.</p>\n<p>You can choose either side, the Arkz or Heroes, which both determines the abilities and cards available to you and the strategy decisions you must make in battle. The Heroes are the stronger of the two at first, with various weapons available to them, while the Arkz can summon creatures to their aid. Gameplay is similar to Magic: The Gathering or Yu-Gi-Oh, using the power and abilities of each card in turn to defeat the enemy.</p>\n<p>Episode III can be played both offline and online, with the online system using a ranking system so you can compete against fair opponents.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Long ago in the kingdom of Hyrule, an evil sorcerer began kidnapping young maidens. This sorcerer was known as Vaati, and it seemed that no one could stop him. Eventually an adventurer appeared who was able to defeat Vaati. This adventurer carried with him the four sword which caused him to be split into four beings, and by working together the four beings were able to seal Vaati deep within the earth. But now Vaati has escaped, and the task of defeating him again has fallen to Link!</p>\n<p>This action adventure game is played from a top down point of view. There are a variety of often maze-like lands to explore (some above ground and others below) as well as a variety of enemies to defeat. Since Link is now in possession of the four sword, there are four Links on the screen. In order to complete the various stages, the four Links will often need to work together in order to solve puzzles and defeat the many enemies. The four links are able to form several different formations, such as a line or square. The formations help the Links perform actions that couldn't be done by one, like moving heavy objects or defeating numerous enemies. At the beginning of each stage, the four sword will be weak in power; to replenish the swords power, force gems must be collected (which can be found hidden in various locations or by defeating enemies). At the end of each stage is a dark magic barrier, and the only way to destroy it is by a four sword which has been completely restored. The game can be played by one to four players, however there will always be four links on the screen. In multi-player games each player will control one of the Links and will need to connect with a Game Boy Advance which is used both to control the game as well is provide each player with their own display when their Link is inside a house or in a cavern.</p>\n<p>In addition to the adventure mode, a multi-player battle mode is included where four Links fight to see who wins.</p>",

The player has a choice between two scenarios, playing as either Yugi, the main hero of the manga, or Kaiba, his antagonist.

So Mario comes to place called Rogueport where Peach was last seen. There he meets a female goomba named Goombella. Mario shows the map to Goombella.

When Mario stands in front of the door, the map begins to show the locations of stars which open the door. The adventure begins from this point. </p>\n<p>Mario can jump, run, hammer, talk to people, etc.. Mario finds many partners on his quest. Battles play out on a stage in front of an audience. In battle, Mario must keep his fans happy by executing action commands (hitting buttons at the right time during his attacks). Occasionally, in battle, the crowd will throw things at Mario.

They also have wings - \"Wings of the Hearts\" - growing on their backs. Kalas is a young man who was born only with one wing - he replaces the second with an artificial wing manufactured by great masters. He is on a quest to find the murderers of his grandfather and his brother. He meets a girl named Xelha, who is out to stop an evil conspiracy that threatens the country, and they join forces against the newly appeared evil. </p>\n<p>In this game, you don't only control Kalas and his party, but also play the role of Kalas' Guardian Spirit. From time to time Kalas will pose questions to you and ask for advice. Your answers will determine Kalas' general disposition and also his behavior in battles.</p>\n<p>The gameplay system is largely based on cards. Many items in the game - from weapons to simple items like trees or milk - possess a so-called \"Magna essence\", which allows you to store it and to transform items into cards that you can later use in battles as weapons, attack spells, defensive moves, or for healing purposes. The enemies in the game are not random, but visible on the screen. When you contact an enemy, a turn-based battle begins. Your party is dealt with a set of random cards from your inventory, and you must plan your turn according to the cards you have.</p>",

To do so, you must create your own creature and train it up, entering it into various competitions against the Black Evil and working towards the main goal. As the competitions are completed, you will unlock new features to improve your own creature in speed, strength, and general appearance. </p>\n<p>While the gameplay relies on your active gamepad skills (mostly pressing a button as fast as possible with minor variations), the chances of success are dictated by the monster's statistics. So, for example, a dragon would be beneficial for a flying mini-game. Those statistics can be further enhanced with items bought at shops.</p>\n<p>Play single and multiplayer battles on the GameCube, or upload your creatures to the Game Boy Advance, taking them on the road to challenge your friends and unlock items and features for the creatures you design.</p>",

The game is a farming simulation in which the player inherits a run-down farm and must make it profitable, start a family, and develop relationships with the neighbors. The major difference is that the player is now female rather than male and can choose a husband and have a child. Other additions are the ability to change outfits and a mirror in the house that will tell the player if she needs to eat or sleep. The game spans six chapters but will end after the first chapter if the player doesn't get married. The Game Boy Advance game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/21502/harvest-moon-more-friends-of-mineral-town/\">Harvest Moon: More Friends of Mineral Town</a> can be connected to this game to unlock extra bonuses.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The citizens on Nanashi Island have the custom of organizing a ceremony to celebrate children's transition into adulthood. The young Pockle, however, has slept through his own ceremony. Missing the ceremony is considered a crime and he is thrown into prison. Mayer, the mayor of the island, agrees to grant Pockle freedom with some significant restrictions: his face is blurred out, he must adhere to an early curfew and is under constant surveillance by a robotic police chief. Pockle also has to find a way to raise five million \"mane\" (the game's currency) to reimburse the organizers of the event. After engaging in menial jobs, Pockle realizes that his true destination in life is to fulfill people's wishes and make them happy, otherwise he is doomed to stay a child forever.</p>\n<p><em>Giftpia</em> is an adventure game with light role-playing elements, similar in concept and execution to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/14088/moon-remix-rpg-adventure/\">Moon</a>. Much of the gameplay consists of various tasks and colorful mini-games involving the exotic islanders. There is no combat in the game; RPG elements consist of managing the main character's life and increasing his wealth, which serves as one of the game's final goals. Pockle has a stamina meter represented by hearts; their amount can be increased by finding additional hearts in the game world. The player needs to feed the protagonist and allow him to sleep regularly.</p>\n<p>The game's world is open-ended; though the overall objective is helping people and earning money, the player is for the most part free to decide how to achieve that, participating in many tasks and activities in no particular order, though some of them must be completed to open up new gameplay possibilities. The game also features a day and night cycle.</p>",

When you and your comrades learn of a strong, autonomous maneuvering robot, you decide to investigate the matter.</p>\n<p>The game mixes action (fighting), simulation (assembling), and RPG elements (do some detective work to unravel the mystery) in a single game. You can construct your own robot with over 200 parts, including over 50 guns, 30 bombs, 30 pods, and 15 legs. In a typical arena match, you have to fight real-time battles and victory means you can acquire new parts and continue with the storyline. As there are different kinds of battles (two-on-two, tag team, four-player battle royale), you have to use different strategies and make use of the obstacles in the arena.</p>",

During your journey, you can travel using a variety of animals, and they each need a certain rhythm to control.

The game is meant to be played with the DK Bongos input device. You have to hit one drum, the other, both or clap when the cursor passes the corresponding circle on the screen to match the rhythm. As you hit the beats, the corner in the top-right corner of the screen will fill up. In the story mode, you need to reach a certain mark to pass. Filling it up completely is awarded a gold medal and victory music.</p>\n<p>A new addition, next to the cast of Donkey Kong characters from the previous game, is Funky Kong, who hosts several game modes and appears in the mini-games. The amount of those small games has been limited, only Rhythm Banana and Trial Mode remain. With different difficulty levels, you can do solo runs, duets with the computer or another player, and even quartets. Coins can be exchanged in the shopping mall for new music.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Path of Radiance</em> is the first installment in the Fire Emblem series to have 3D. Set on the Tellius continent, a soldier called Ike rescues the princess of Crimea and finds out that the Daein kingdom has invaded the country. He must guide her with his fellow mercenaries to Gallia. During the journey, the true reasons for the war are revealed.</p>\n<p>You command your units across a 3D battlefield with turn-based mechanics. Each turn, you can only move a set amount of spaces over the grid. Turns can be used to visit locations, use items, or attack enemies. Each battle is stats-based and has a specific objective. You do not fight yourself, instead, you control the items and weapons to influence the stats, and make use of the enemies' weaknesses. The maps have different scenarios, where you have to rescue a certain character, create distractions to move past enemies, or kill certain foes.</p>\n<p>The game is heavy on anime-styled story sequences. As with all Fire Emblem games, the characters are unique individuals that cannot be revived when they fall in battle. In order to continue with the story, only the team leaders need to survive. Characters can equip a range of weapons and possess magical abilities. Upon discovering 'hidden purposes', unique abilities can be acquired.</p>",

John has to find his body before it perishes.</p>\n<p>Players start the game as John Raimi in human form. The game plays as though it is a regular first-person shooter. Players in human form can strafe, aim, run, and shoot enemies. In spirit form, they must possess people or animals to keep from being pulled into the afterlife; they can also drain the life from plants. To possess a being, first players have to frighten it. Players achieve this by possessing objects in the environment and making them do strange things.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Mario and friends are challenged to play baseball with Bowser. So they play ball games with each other to decide who should play Bowser. The rules are the same as any other baseball game with some exceptions. Like other baseball games, each team gets three strikes, three outs, and four balls per inning. However, you can choose to play less than nine innings. </p>\n<p>You can also choose from Exhibition, Challenge, Toy Field, and Mini-game modes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exhibition mode is one game between two teams.</li>\n<li>In Challenge mode, you choose a team to play every other team; you can get the other teams characters by completing certain challenges. When you beat the other teams, you get a chance to play Bowser's team.</li>\n<li>In Toy Field mode, up to four players take turns to get the most points; players receive points by hitting the ball at certain spots, which consist of out, 1, 2, or 3-hits, or homerun spots. You can get a turn by catching the ball when your opponent hits the ball.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the start of Exhibition and Challenge modes, you choose your team captain. In Exhibition mode, you also choose team members, but in Challenge mode, your team members depend on which captain you pick.</p>\n<p>All the team captains have star pitches and star hits. The characters can also pitch fastballs and change-ups. You can unlock more characters through Challenge mode.</p>",

You can switch between a first-person view, and control one of your men to lead in battle, or you can use the top-down view, where you have a good view of the battlefield.

But Bowser showed up and is wrecking the good times; the only thing left to do is play a game of Mario Party!</p>\n<p>This is the seventh entry in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/1765/mario-party-series/\">Mario Party Series</a> and features similar gameplay. The game features a combination of a board game and mini games. The goal is to collect as many stars as possible as you make your way around the game board; after each turn, players compete in one of 86 mini games. The winner of the mini game earns coins which can be used to purchase the stars. Mini games can be played with players in teams, or every player for them self. In addition to the regular spaces, the game board also features several other types of spaces; some will begin a Bowser mini game, provide hidden bonuses, or allow you to purchase orbs to help slow down your opponents. Most of the mini games are played with the GameCube controller, and also included in the package is a microphone which is used for several voice activated mini games.</p>\n<p>The usual single player and multi player game modes are included. New in this release is the ability for up to eight players to compete! In the eight player game variation two players will need to share each of the controllers, each player controlling one of the analog sticks and a trigger.</p>",

The game is played in an arena enclosed within an electric fence, and the players can use items. Bowser shows up from time to time to shake things up. You can steal, pass, shoot, deke, hit other players, and more. Players choose a team captain, sidekicks, and a side. You can choose from play modes such as grudge match, cup battle, custom tournament, and a tutorial. A team captain can also do a super strike which counts as two goals but be careful because an opponent can still hit you. Sidekicks cannot do a super strike but can charge a shot for more power. Players can do a lob pass or ground pass. You can execute a one-timer by shooting as soon as a teammate passes the ball to you. You can hit any opponent but if you hit one who does not possess the ball their team receives an item. You can get an item by scoring a goal.</p>",

This game allows you to race tiny little toy cars around various oversized environments. Most of the cars resemble super-deformed versions of popular automobiles, but the actual model names are not used. There are dozens of tiny cars to collect.</p>\n<p>Some of the tracks in this game appear to be scaled to the size of your racer, others take place in oversized real-world environments, like a house or a garden.</p>\n<p>The usual racing game modes are present, single race, championship, and multi-player. Winning races allows you to purchase upgrades and other vehicles.

        "description": "<p>The roar of the crowd, the grass stains on your pants, running home for dinner...? Yep, it's Backyard Football - football with kids. Backyard Football brings you all the action and excitement of American Football, with all the charm and nostalgia of neighborhood sports. </p>\n<p>Use the Backyard kids as players and/or play with the pros, as kids. In Backyard Football for GameCube, you get all 32 NFL teams to choose from as well as traditional Backyard Sports teams. You also get kid versions of top players in 2002 - Brett Favre, Rich Gannon, Jerry Rice, Michael Vick, Peyton Manning, Donovan McNabb, Jeff Garcia, Ricky Williams, Jevon Kearse, and Terrell Davis. Kicking, passing, audibles, juking, stiff-arming, tackling, and hurdling - it's all there.</p>\n<p>And it may be \"backyard\" sports, but it still has instant replay, with VCR-like controls that allow you to move the camera around.</p>\n<p>The game is true 3D, unlike earlier PC versions. As the coach, you draft your team, set your starting line-up and strategize your plays. Use existing plays or make your own in the playbook. Then play a 14-game season, with weekly schedules and season statistics. Or just do a pick-up game or Coaches' Challenge</p>",

Never sold at retail, the compilation was available as a pre-order bonus for <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8725/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker/\">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>, sold with certain GameCube bundles, or made available through <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Nintendo+of+Europe\">Nintendo of Europe's</a> Stars Catalogue. Both games run at a higher resolution than the original versions, plus feature 480p Progressive Scan support and Dolby Surround.</p>\n<p><em>Master Quest</em> is essentially the same game as <em>Ocarina of Time</em>. While the adventure unfolds in the same way (same enemies, items, characters), the difference lies in the dungeon layouts. Dungeons are remixed, meaning that item placement and room progression have been altered. So, even if you have already played <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, <em>Master Quest</em> offers a new take on a familiar setting.</p>\n<p>Also included on the compilation are video previews of various GameCube and GBA games.

        "description": "<p><em>Odama</em> is a quirky pinball title set in feudal Japan. You are in control of a giant steel ball, called the Odama, which you use to crush the enemy army (and hopefully not your own soldiers) so that you have an easier time leading the Ninten Bell to its destination.</p>\n<p>The game also takes of advantage of the GCN microphone (included with most versions of the game), which you use to command your troops. You must use the commands and pinball skills to successfully lead the Ninten Bell to its destination before sunset in each mission.</p>\n<p>Using the L+R buttons to control the flippers, the X button to activate the microphone, and the control stick to tilt the battlefield, the controls in Odama are quite simple for today's standards. In each mission, you, representing the Yamanouchi clan, try to bring the clan's powerful treasure, the Ninten Bell, as well as the Odama, closer to the Karasuma Keep, headed by the man who betrayed the founder of the Yamanouchi clan. It is there you will exact revenge for his betrayal. Notably, the game features a narrator that talks about the story in Japanese, but there are English subtitles.</p>\n<p>The basic goal of each mission is to guide the bell from the bottom to the top of the screen, mowing down the members of the opposing army with the Odama, as well as killing them with your own soldiers. It is important that they are killed because, if they reach your side of the screen, they will make the flippers inactive for a relatively long period of time. When all Odamas are lost or the sun sets, you fail the mission. In addition, you learn commands for your soldiers as you progress through the game. Using these commands, you'll be able to more effectively control your soldiers in many ways. For example, by saying, \"press forward,\" your troops will use all of their strength to try and plow through enemy soldiers. These commands are not only very useful, but in many cases, are vital to your success.</p>\n<p>However, use of certain commands and reckless use of the Odama drains your Morale Bar. When this bar is low, your troops will stop responding to your commands, which can and will be disastrous to your mission.</p>\n<p>There are also items that the Odama can pick up along the way to aid you. Most notably is one that allows the Odama to convert all members of the opposing army over to yours when it rolls them over.</p>\n<p>In merging all of these elements, Odama is a very fast, difficult, and frenzied title. Although it is a pinball game at its core, the voice commands, power-ups, and storyline throw it into a league of its own.</p>",

Long ago, the evil god Malpercio attempted to destroy the other gods; a large battle of the gods ensued, and following this, the people of the world were forced to flee to various islands floating in the sky. 1000 years after the war the people live peacefully in the sky for the most part; but Emperor Olgen, the emperor of one of these islands, has begun a plot to gain control of all the islands.</p>\n<p>The main character of the story is Sagi, a \"Spirit-born\" individual who has been given a secret mission to assassinate Emperor Olgen. In similar fashion to <em>Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean</em>, you don't actually control Sagi in the game but rather his guardian spirit. Throughout the game, you can give Sagi advice, and as you progress the story will unfold revealing the plot that may threaten all of the islands...</p>\n<p>The gameplay is similar to <em>Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean</em> and features a card-based battle system. Many items in the world have a \"Magna essence\"; these items can be captured in a card for use later. Some items are useful for attacking and defending, others can help replenish your health, and some can be used to solve puzzles. When a battle begins your deck of cards will be randomly dealt to you; battles are turn-based, on each turn you can select cards from those visible to use. Different cards also feature different attributes, and various combos are possible. When a battle is won, your characters will earn experience points, gold, and will also recover all hit points.</p>\n<p>The battles in the game aren't random; as you explore the worlds, enemies will be visible on screen in some areas and contact with them begins the battle. In addition to the main storyline, numerous sub-quests will also become available by talking with various characters; completing a sub-quest will typically earn a useful item for you as well as provide an opportunity for your characters to level up. You will encounter many types of enemies on both the main quest and subquests; since different enemies may require different strategies, you have the ability to customize the deck of cards you will use in battle. As you gain experience, you will also gain the ability to create multiple decks.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the toy franchise and later the anime series, <em>Zoids: Battle Legends</em> casts the player as one of 17 soldiers with different abilities, controlling one of the giant robots modelled after animals and the dinosaurs. There are 4 main modes: Mission, Zoids Battle, VS and Zoids Fist. In the mission mode the player chooses a side (empire or republic) and fights other giant Zoid robots in different stages, connected by cut-scenes pushing the narrative forward. As an empire soldier, you start as Kouki, a young officer hunting the republicans. On the republican side of things, the game starts with Shomo is search of the Blue Unicorn Team that has gone missing. Most of the modes are fairly identical, but Zoids Fist is played in confined spaces.</p>\n<p>There are different characters and robots available while playing, and the Zoids can lock on targets to fire, move around and use boost for quick manoeuvres. Close combat is also possible, in wrestling-style fashion. Every Zoid has different upgrade slots for armor, weapons and shields. The colour can also be defined. The environment is destructible and can be used to your advantage for instance with sniping positions on top of buildings.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Mr. Driller and his friends are invited to the opening of Drill Land, a theme park with five different attractions. Mr. Driller and the rest of the crew set out to explore the unique drill-themed attractions and complete them, to earn a stamp from each one.</p>\n<p><em>Mr. Driller: Drill Land</em> is a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=722674020992\">Mr. Driller</a>. The basic goal is like the original - players must dig through from top to bottom, aiming to reach the goal depth in meters. As they dig, they gradually lose air, so they must also collect air capsules to replenish their air and prevent losing a life. However, Drill Land has five different attractions, each with its own unique take on the <em>Mr. Driller</em> formula:<em> </em><em>The Hole of Druaga</em>* - An obvious homage to the Namco game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=DMG-ADA-JPN\">The Tower of Druaga</a>, The Hole of Druaga has Anna Hottenmeyer digging through a block filled castle, encountering enemies such as slimes, knights and wizards. Anna must find and defeat the dragon that is guarding the key to the exit, and then make it to the exit to battle the final boss.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>World Drill Tour</strong> - The standard <em>Mr. Driller</em> mode of play. Dig your way through to the set depth, using any character that you like. Each character has their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Star Driller</strong> - A spaced themed stage where you play as Susumu. Dig through the blocks, and make your way to the set depth. Star blocks are power-ups that can either help (such as a barrier for an extra hit) or hinder (like a black hole that sucks all the blocks away close to you).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Drindy Adventure</strong> - This stage stars Taizo from the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=722674020145\">Dig Dug</a>, in an Indiana Jones-like setting. Taizo does not require air in this mode, and his goal is to collect a set amount of gold statues. In his way are traps like rolling boulders, spikes, and flames.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Horror Night House</strong> - A ghost-themed stage featuring Ataru as a ghost hunter. Your goal is to kill ghosts by first collecting holy water to fill your syringe-like drill, and then wait for ghosts to get close to you, and inject the nearby bricks with holy water to stun them. While the ghosts are stunned, you can break the bricks to finish them off.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Mr. Driller: Drill Land</em> also features two multiplayer modes: Race and Battle. Race has each player trying to be the first to reach the set depth. Battle has everyone on the same screen, attempting to collect the gold coin. It takes three gold coins to win.</p>",

The game has a new and longer story mode, as well as continuations of the storylines from the first game. The player can also create his own wrestlers and put them in the story mode. The wrestlers Bret Hart and Hulk Hogan join the roster as Legends.</p>\n<p>The fighting system has been enhanced. Basic gameplay revolves around stamina rather than just a general energy level. If all stamina is gone, the player won't be able to control the wrestler. In addition, players can perform up to four unique submission moves. The game displays injuries sustained by the wrestlers, ranging from a small cut on the forehead to a face or a chest covered by blood, which may also drip onto the mat and stay there.

The mechanics of the game are clearly arcade in its realization, as they intend to emulate the spectacularity of the anime. This is specially experienced through the special moves, attacks that can be executed when a specific bar hits the top, which in many cases allow you to have your rival projected to the air and still be able to apply him a lock before he hits the ground. Regarding playable fighters, this game combines 20 characters from both the oldest and newer seasons of the series, among them: Kid Muscle, Terry Kenyon, Wally Tusket, Checkmate, Dik Dik Van Dik, Kevin Mask, Jeager, King Muscle, Sunshine, Ramenman, Buffaloman, Terryman, Brocken Jr, etc; plus 10 more, who are \"guests\" unrelated to the anime series. Other notable aspect of the game is the power-ups: items thrown by your team partner or the manager himself, that among many things can increase your energy or special bars, but also injure your opponents.</p>",

Up to four players fight in an enclosed arena using various attacks and abilities. During battles, weapons will appear which can be picked up and used. Items called Rave Stones and Shadow Stones also appear, which will grant special abilities to the player who picks them up. Twelve characters from the anime and manga are available to play as.</p>\n<p>There are several modes of play, including story mode, where you choose one of five characters and play through their story; VS mode, where up to four players fight with various kinds of rules; and free mode, where the goal is to survive through a series of stages.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mystic Heroes</em> is a fighting game loosely based on the novel <em>Fengshen Yanyi</em> (16th century). The player takes the role of a hero who fights against the evil ex-emperor Kang and his magical army. The gameplay itself is simple: the player wades through enemy hordes and kills them all. He has the choice between eight characters which all have different advantages and disadvantages - but basically the player chooses between sword and magical attacks. He can also use combo attacks. </p>\n<p>During the course of the game the player can find magical runes which give him additional magical abilities and power-ups, e.g. health and mana refreshments or temporary and permanent improvements to the attacking and defending statistics. In fact some of these runes have to be earned by completing the story mode multiple times - the player can use the same character for his and gets to keep his abilities and statistics. Mana also replenishes with every defeated foe. Besides the story there is also a Survival mode.</p>\n<p>Although the story is the same, there are differences between this version and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/47803/mystic-heroes/\">Mystic Heroes for the Playstation 2</a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Picking up six years after <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Resident+Evil+2\">Resident Evil 2</a>, the fourth game in the series follows a former cop (now US agent) Leon S. Kennedy to Europe on a top-secret mission to investigate the disappearance of the president's daughter Ashley. As Leon encounters unimaginable horrors, he must find out who or what is behind everything. Old friends...and enemies...lurk around every corner as Leon attempts to find out who is truly behind the kidnapping of the president's daughter.</p>\n<p><em>Resident Evil 4</em> is a major change from the previous installments. Instead of a fixed third-person perspective, the game features a new \"behind the back\" movement camera angle and an \"over the shoulder\" aiming feature that allows players to control their gun movement for specific body part hits. It features a brand new AI system and more open environments that allow enemies to work together to capture and corner Leon. Enemies are now humans, which allows them to climb up ladders, open doors, and use weapons throughout the game. </p>\n<p>The entire item system has also been revamped, so that smaller items no longer require an entire item space to hold. Instead, items take up blocks of space in a briefcase according to their real-life size, to allow for many more items and weapons. Leon can collect treasure from enemies or from the surrounding area, and visit the infamous \"merchant\" to purchase bigger briefcases, treasure maps, weapons upgrades, and powerful weapons such as the one-shot RPG.</p>\n<p>There is also <em>the Mercenaries</em> from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/140612/resident-evil-3/\">Resident Evil 3</a>, which allows the player to play survival scenarios as characters such as Hunk and even Albert Wesker himself.</p>",

        "description": "<p>From <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/1765/mario-party-series/\">Mario Party</a> creator Hudson Soft comes a similar party game using the Disney license and characters.</p>\n<p>For the main game modes (Game Board and Pairs), players can select from six characters: Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Donald and Daisy Duck, Goofy, and Billy the Ghost. Uncle Scrooge invites four of them to his theme park. At the beginning of the game, each character is handed a five-by-five game board, with randomized colors. The goal is to complete rows on the board (how many can be adjusted before a game) by putting items of the appropriate color on the board, with the first player to complete his board being the winner.</p>\n<p>The characters move on a 3D game board. Movement is not made via dice but the so-called Wheel of Destiny. Players choose which space on the board they want to go to next. More players wishing for the same space increases its chances of being chosen. All characters then move to the selected space together.</p>\n<p>There are 14 different types of space, including items, events, shops (which use crystals as currency), transportation to another part of the board, and mini-games. The mini-games, of which there are 30 different ones, are the main part of the game. All are played by all four characters together and include racing, shooting, image-matching, counting, pressing displayed button combinations, and many more. The goal is to collect a number of stars, with the player who reaches the number first being the winner. Power notes, which can either be found or bought in shops, can be used to give an advantage during a mini-game.</p>\n<p>To reach the goal of completing the rows, found or bought items can be placed on the game boards upon winning a mini-game or reaching the appropriate space. Items can be put on other player's boards, too, to help or sabotage their efforts. Special items include ones that re-arrange the board grid or block off rows.</p>\n<p>Once the set number of rows is completed, the main game ends, but a final challenge round follows, consisting of another mini-game and special awards for the likes of \"best item collector\" or \"best mini-game player\". The player who completed the rows first starts with an advantage, but it is also possible for other players to win if they were better in the award categories. Completing the game unlocks collectible character cards, depending on the reached score.</p>\n<p>Unlocked mini-games can be played on their own in the Mini-Game Mode, while Free Pass mode allows one to navigate around the game board freely and try out any attraction or game.</p>",

Three game modes are included: exhibition games (for up to four players), Dream Cup and Challenge Cup. The Dream Cup is a knockout tournament, while the Challenge Cup asks players to take on all other teams in the game successively. The game features the setting of formations and strategies and upgrading player's abilities.</p>\n<p>The controls allow for a variety of moves during a match, including shot curves, one-two passes, keeper charges, volleys, and much more. Arcade elements come into play with magic abilities. These are unlocked through winning Cup matches and allow the team captains to use powers such as extra-powerful kicks that are guaranteed to hit the goal or can incapacitate other players, short time invincibility, and many more.</p>",

A special ability becomes usable after a fighter's Chakra Meter is filled all the way, which is done by either receiving or inflicting damage. Fighters can also perform a teleport type move but performing it will cost the fighter some of their energy.</p>\n<p>The game has several modes such as a Story mode, with interspersing cutscenes between fights, a two player battle mode, a survival mode, a time attack mode, and a training mode. The game's extras include a gallery, character profiles, and a sound test.

        "description": "<p><em>Disney Sports Basketball</em> is the fourth and last in a series of GameCube-exclusive games that combine popular sports with Disney characters, offering three-on-three hoops.</p>\n<p>Players can select from eight different teams, captained by the Disney characters Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, Goofy, Max, Huey, and Mortimer, with the two remaining players on each team filled by generic characters (except for Huey, who is joined by his brothers). Each team comes with its own home arena. Available playing modes include exhibition games (for up to four players), a 14-game season (7 home, 7 away games) and a Challenge Cup, which is a competition against six other teams in freely selectable order, followed by games against the \"bad guy\" teams of Mortimer and Pete. Winning the Challenge Cup unlocks the All-Star Game mode, for which teams consisting of only the star characters can be selected. A tutorial mode that teaches the game's controls in distinct lessons is also available.</p>\n<p>Controls on the court are simple, with one button for shooting, one for stopping the dribble and keeping the ball away from the defender, and two for passing to the other two teammates. On defense, two buttons block and steal, and two switch to the other players. Scoring increases a power meter that when full, enables special moves and super dunks that net more points than usual. Going with the arcade flavor of the game, there are no fouls or free throws.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Monsters, Inc.: Scream Arena</em> is based on the 2001 Pixar film. Set after the movie, the employees of Monsters, Inc. now produce energy by making children laugh instead of scaring them. One good way of doing that is having the monsters knock each other over with balls, resulting in a dodgeball-like game.</p>\n<p>The game includes 13 characters and 7 arenas based on locations from the film. At the start of a single-player game, only 5 characters and the training arena are accessible, others have to be unlocked by advancing through the levels. There are 5 levels for each arena, for a total of 35 levels plus one final challenge. Selectable characters vary in speed and throwing power.</p>\n<p>Goals vary between levels and include scoring more points than the opponents, being the last monster standing, hitting a number of targets, or holding on to a special ball the longest. Balls spawn on the ground and must be picked up and thrown at opponents or targets to score points, knock off one of their lives or free a held ball. To avoid being hit, balls can be blocked or dodged. Various special balls with unique properties exist. These include stun balls that knock out opponents temporarily, bubble balls that trap them in a soap bubble, yo-yo balls that come back to the thrower, pet balls that follow their owners around, and many more.</p>\n<p>Multiplayer modes include Buddy, which is a two-player co-op mode, Team, which allows two-versus-two matchups, and Party, which is free-for-all four a maximum of four players. Arenas and characters must be unlocked in single-player mode.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Home Run King</em> is an MLB-licensed baseball game released exclusively for the GameCube. Designed more as a pick-up-and-play game than a detailed simulation, it offers fast-paced gameplay and a basic selection of modes.</p>\n<p>Modes include Exhibition, Season, Playoffs, and Home Run Derby. The game features team customization and player creation and trading. Players will control all aspects of play: pitching, batting, fielding, and running.</p>\n<p>The pitching interface features a pitch type selector that displays the pitches available to the current player as lines whose length indicates their effectiveness. Pitches are selected by moving the control stick in the appropriate direction, and then pressing the appropriate button for normal, slow, or fast pitches or pick-off throws. A timing gauge must be stopped at the maximum point for the best results.</p>\n<p>The batting interface reuses the pitch type selector, this time for predicting the pitch that is thrown. A batting cursor must be moved to meet the incoming ball to hit it. If the correct pitch was predicted, the cursor is larger and makes hitting easier. Bunts, as well as normal, power, and contact swings, are possible.</p>\n<p>During fielding, an icon indicates the ball's height and position, and the A button can be pressed to make a super play: diving or sliding after the ball. Before the pitch is made, runners can be made to increase their lead for an attempted steal. Running is otherwise automatic, with only the destination base selectable.</p>",

The game does however ship with a special pedometer and walking pad controller to simulate these aspects. Players can visit 23 out of the 88 temples and perform the various rituals associated with the pilgrimage: washing hands, offering prayer etc.</p>",
