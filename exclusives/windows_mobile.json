On the strategic front, it will be your job to manage the organization, hire staff, buy equipment, conduct research and more. On the tactical front, you will send soldiers to carry out combat missions on downed UFOs and enemy bases.</p>\n<p>Building bases, assigning research, hiring and allocating stuff and equipment is done on the global world map. Research is essential to the development of the technologies you will need to defeat the aliens. Engineers will implement these technologies, building better equipment.\nYou can build several bases in different areas of the globe. In each base you will have several facilities such as living quarters for your staff, research laboratories, and hangars for aircraft.\nYou will have to send out craft to intercept and shoot down UFOs discovered on the radar, and then a troop to clear the area of the downed UFO. This is when the combat missions start.</p>\n<p>Combat is isometric view and turn-based. Each soldier has a limited amount of time-units to use each turn for moving around, shooting, crouching, etc. At the end of your turn the aliens take their turn and so on. The skill and experience of your soldiers, the time of day, the terrain are some of the factors that affect combat.</p>\n<p>Pocket UFO is very faithful to the original game - and recreates the classic mixture of strategy and tactics.</p>",

Tapping and holding down the stylus moves a player around while lifting the stylus and then tapping again leads to a pass being made. Shooting is done by pressing a button, and holding it down gives extra height, but it is also possible to use the stylus to add aftertouch and curve the ball's movement.</p>\n<p>In addition to single matches and a practice mode, the game contains a FIFA World Cup Qualifier mode which despite its name is the actual 2002 World Cup. All 32 teams are included and they are grouped like in the real tournament. The best teams in each group goes through to the knockout stages where each match has to be won to reach the final qualifier game. The game also contains teams from six national leagues but these can only be played in friendlies.</p>",

The game is played from a top down perspective and by tapping the screen the marked player will run in that direction. Running with ball is done by holding down the stylus and moving around. Shooting and passing is done by drawing a line from one player to another or towards the goal. When in defence, line drawing is used to make tackles. A short line is used for standard tackles while longer lines lead to sliding tackles.</p>\n<p>The game contains three game modes: exhibition, tournaments and shootouts. Exhibition is single matches between any two of the game's national teams. The tournament mode involves competing against seven randomly selected teams in a knockout competition. There are three difficulty levels that need to be unlocked in order. The shootout mode is a game of penalties which unlike the main game is played from a behind view.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Baseball Addict</em> is a baseball game for touch screen devices that uses stylus controls. Pitching and batting is done from a behind view of the hitter while commanding the field players is done from a top down view. When pitching the player chooses one of three pitch types before setting destination and power by holding down the stylus. When batting taking a swing is done by simple tapping on the screen where the ball crosses the plate. After a hit the player taps on the ground to move the fielders and taps on bases on a mini map to make them throw the ball. Runners are controlled by drawing lines between bases.</p>\n<p>There are three game modes: exhibition, tournaments and homerun derbys. An exhibition is a single game between any two teams. Tournaments are knockout competitions consisting of quarter finals, semi finals and finals. There are three levels that have to be completed in order. Homerun derbys are all about batting and hitting the most homeruns.</p>",

The player takes control of Tony Montana as he goes from rags to riches.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is similar to the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>. The player is free to roam the in-game city of Miami and choose which missions they would like to complete. Players can hide from the police by entering a safehouse. Completing missions will give players money which they can spend on better weapons and new safehouses. Players can steal cars and are offered 2 different control schemes for steering, accelerating and breaking. Players may also enter buildings and may be required to do so to complete some of the missions. The game adds a nice touch by playing different tunes when Tony is driving a car, simulating a radio.</p>\n<p>Combat is semi-automatic with the player pressing a key to take out their guns and the protagonist shooting the closest enemies automatically. The only thing players can change is the target that Tony is shooting. Players will need to dodge fire from Tony's enemies while he battles them.</p>",

Tiles have arrows on them and clicking on one turns all tiles in its direction into its color. Green and red arrows at the same time rotate 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise. Each level has to be completed before time runs out. Turning tiles blue lead to extra time being given while turning tiles red or green decreases the time left.</p>",
