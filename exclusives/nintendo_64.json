        "description": "<p><em>Mario Party</em> is a party game for 1 to 4 players. The festivities are based on a board game format, right down to the fact that players must roll a die to determine how many spaces to move. Players land on different squares, each space holding one of more than fifty different mini-games. These quick competitions determine who will earn coins and stars, and who will go home empty handed. </p>\n<p>The mini-games are spread over eight different game boards, all of which are not immediately available. Some of the games pit every man or princess against the others, some are two-on-two, and others are even three against one. One challenge is loosely based on \"Simon Says\", another involves a two-on-two bobsled race, and one game makes one player attempt to cross a rope while the other three do their best to shake the player off. There are skill games, racing games, puzzle games, and other types.</p>\n<p>A good portion of the actual game boards are animated, with hidden dangers and special challenges scattered everywhere. Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Donkey Kong, Bowser, Yoshi, and Wario are all invited to the party, and each character has his or her own game board.</p>",

After the islands prized racetracks become sealed up, Timber Tiger contacts his friend Diddy Kong to help him reclaim the racetracks and save the island before his parents return. Along for the ride are the Kremling spy Krunch, Bumper Badger, Banjo (prior to meeting Kazooie in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3583/banjo-kazooie/\">Banjo-Kazooie</a>), pre-sweary <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Twelve+Tales:+Conker+64\">Conker</a>, Tiptup Turtle, and Pipsy Mouse.</p>\n<p><em>Diddy Kong Racing</em> is a racing game with similarities to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3535/mario-kart-64/\">Mario Kart 64</a>, in that you race with a variety of cheery racers while using weapons. However, the similarities end there. DKR includes an adventure mode, which features bosses, an overworld to explore, <strong>many</strong> hidden secrets, the addition of hovercrafts and planes, and a unique way of racing called the \"Silver Coin Challenge\". In this mode, in addition to coming first, you must also find the eight Silver Coins deviously hidden throughout the courses (some in alternate paths).</p>\n<p>The game also features a strategic method of using weapons. Each colored balloon on the track matches a specific weapon, and collecting the same type of balloon multiple times in a row powers it up (to a maximum of three times). This gives the player the choice of snatching every balloon available and using it immediately, or storing the existing weapon, and using a more powerful version of it later.</p>\n<p>Up to four players can compete in the races, but in order to play new tracks, they must first be unlocked in the single player game. There are also four battle modes of play - two standard deathmatch maps, a capture-the-flag style battle where you must nab eggs and hatch three of them in your home nest, and another where you must be the first to return ten bananas to your treasure chest (with the limitation of only being able to hold two at any one time).</p>",

        "description": "<p>Conker the Squirrel has had a really bad day. Too much partying, too much booze - and the result is predictable: a terrible hangover. What is less predictable, however, is the fact that Conker has no idea where he is. All he wants is to go home to his girlfriend Berri, but it seems that an unknown force has thrown him into another world. The ruler of said world, the dumb, but vicious Panther King, is having a serious problem: he has been just drinking milk when he discovered that the table in his throne room is missing one of its legs. Unable to solve the problem by himself, the enraged monarch sends for the mad weasel scientist, Professor Von Kriplespac, who suggests a red squirrel as a replacement for the table's lost leg. The Panther King sends his minions after Conker, who has to explore the bizarre world, deal with its eccentric characters, stay alive, and find a way to return home.</p>\n<p><em>Conker's Bad Fur Day</em> is a grotesque counterpart to Rare's own cheerful, child-oriented 3D action platformers (such as for example <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3583/banjo-kazooie/\">Banjo-Kazooie</a>). Intense swearing, violence, and instances of \"toilet humor\" co-exist with cute animals and a brightly colorful fantasy world. The game also contains segments that parody famous movies, such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=matrix\"> The Matrix</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=terminator\"> Terminator</a>, and others.</p>\n<p>The core of the gameplay is 3D platform action. Conker can jump, climb, swim, and attack enemies with various weapons (the default one being a frying pan). Conker can also collect money, which is sometimes needed to advance to a new area. The game world is reasonably open, containing an overworld from which the player can access large levels that take a while to explore. Talking to characters and performing tasks offered by them is one of the main devices used to advance the plot and unlock a different area.</p>\n<p>A multiplayer mode is also included, allowing 4 players to battle it out in many different styles of multiplayer gameplay, including a deathmatch, a race, a \"capture the flag\"-like mini-game, etc.</p>",

A nuclear missile carrier is out of control on a one way-set path, and unless that path is cleared, it will explode as soon as it makes contact with anything, destroying the world. It is up to you to clear the path so that nothing gets in the way of the Carrier.</p>\n<p><em>Blast Corps</em> is a mix of an action and a puzzle game where destruction is key. At the start of each level the player is given a certain vehicle (ranging from robotic suits to trucks or bulldozers), and are told to clear the path for the Carrier. Players need to use their heavy-duty equipment to destroy any buildings, structures, or monuments that stand in the path of the Carrier. The difficulty increases as progress is made, though. Smaller vehicles don't affect certain buildings, and sometimes it's not even a building that's in the way. The player must use the resources around them to clear the path. Players may need a train flatbed to fill a gap, or a crane to move boxes out of the way. The Carrier is always moving, so once the player is done destroying one obstruction, they must get to the next one quickly. While players pursue their mission they must also find six scientists scattered throughout the globe to form a think-tank to solve the problem. The Carrier has to leave Earth, and it's your job to ensure that it will!</p>\n<p><em>Blast Corps</em> features secrets to find. Besides clearing each path for the Carrier, players can go back to a level once it has been completed to take their time and explore. To fully complete a level, players must also find RDUs (Radiation Dispersal Units), which light up on the ground when the player is in close proximity to them, as well as destroy all of the buildings, rescue all of the homeless civilians, which is done by the T-chopper that accompanies the player on every mission. There are also dozens of secret time trial levels that can be found by activating special satellite dishes hidden throughout the levels. If the player manages to get all of the secrets in a level they receive a second medal, and once all of the gold medals are found the developers have a tiny message for them...</p>",

        "description": "<p>WCW/NWO Revenge puts the power of the biggest, baddest and meanest wrestlers around the world in the hands of the player. There are more than 60 real and fictional wrestlers - including then-superstars Hollywood Hogan, Kevin Nash, Raven and Goldberg - to choose from to square off in the ring in any of several modes of play. </p>\n<p>Each wrestler has an extensive list of moves they are able to perform, although certain physical attributes can affect the availability of certain actions - such as a heavyweight not being able to perform a moonsault from the top ropes, or a cruiserweight not being able to power bomb a larger opponent. The engine is based upon a B-button strike and A-button grapple system. Holding the respective button results in a 'heavy' strike or grapple. Finishing off an opponent generally involves performing your wrestler's special move on them, which can be executed with the flick of the control stick once the wrestler has filled his Spirit Meter, and will be followed with a TV-style instant replay. Depending on the match settings set beforehand, a player can find hidden weapons from the crowd, be assisted or double-teamed by a run-in interference or make his opponent tap out with a submission hold.</p>\n<p>There are several match types and game modes, all of which can take place in a number of arenas designed after the current WCW pay-per-view events of the time. New to the series is a 40-man battle royal, allowing for 4 players or computer-controlled wrestlers to square off in the ring at a time until one is pinned or submitted; at which point they are replaced by a new entrant, continuing on and on until up to 40 wrestlers have entered. The main focus of single-player wrestling revolved around the championship mode, in which a player chooses a wrestler and a championship belt to compete for - beginning with the TV Title on up to the WCW World Championship. After defeating a successive series of opponents, the player then goes toe-to-toe with the current holder of the belt for possession of the championship; upon victory a new wrestler and new championship is unlocked. 1-4 player exhibition matches can be set to play out with an assortment of various settings and rules - such as 2 vs. 1 handicaps, no-disqualifications and tag team battles.</p>\n<p>The game automatically tracks and saves to the battery the stats and arcade-style scores accrued across the various game modes. Also available to the player is a costume editing feature, allowing for quick color changes to full-on wardrobe conversions for each wrestler.</p>\n<p>Revenge was a refinement of the engine seminal wrestling house AKI developed for WCW/NWO World Tour. It would be their final WCW game, as the developer moved on and converted their engine to the WWF license with their next release.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Duke Nukem 3D makes its way to the N64 for the first time, with plenty of new additions:</p>\n<p>Weapons: New weapons include two sub-machine guns (one in each hand), the Expander (the bad guys just go pop!) a plasma cannon (which is chargeable) and a grenade launcher. Sadly, there are a few missing from the original PC version, including the Ripper Chaingun, the Devastator, and the Freeze-Ray.</p>\n<p>Presentation: The biggest changes come here, as there are new areas to explore, some improved environments, and the same wise cracks that have made Duke famous. There are also some jokes hidden away based on classic movies (Clockwork Orange, 12 Monkeys, Mars Attacks and Apocalypse Now).</p>\n<p>However, there have been plenty of restrictions in this version of Duke 3D. Nintendo have replaced some areas (the porn mag shop has turned into a gun store, the bar is now a burger joint, and the nude women aren't nude anymore), and there is an option available to turn the blood off.</p>\n<p>A 4 player mode has also been included, where you can take on your mates as well as Duke Bots, and a 2 player co-op mode, so two players can tackle the single player missions.</p>",

This effect nearly ended the life of Oblivion, a 'thing' that drifts through space, consuming anything that ends up in its way. Also during this explosion, a new world was created. In this world lies the Turok family tree, and Oblivion knows that the only way the pain the lies within can be stopped is to destroy the Turok line. </p>\n<p>The third title in the <em>Turok</em> series allows you to choose who will become the successor of the Turok lineage, either Danielle Fireseed or her brother Joseph. Each has unique paths through the same levels, as Joseph's small size allows him to fit into air ducts to take the low road, while Danielle's magnetic grappling hook allows her to take the high road. Each also has unique upgrades to basic weapons. While Danielle's shotgun upgrade coats the shrapnel in napalm to immolate anything they touch, Joseph's instead charges them with electricity, causing them to ricochet off of walls and floors. The story is told through in-game cutscenes with highly detailed models. There are no keys to collect this time around, as each level leads linearly into the next.</p>\n<p><em>Turok 2</em>'s multiplayer mode returns, and includes the ability to add computer controlled bots. Each playable character in multiplayer mode has a unique set of weapons they can use.</p>",

There was no time to tell anybody, Rocket had to go and stop Jojo alone.</p>\n<p><em>Rocket: Robot on Wheels</em> is a 3D platformer like no other. It features 8 vehicles in 6 worlds all in unscripted, realtime physics. As Rocket you have to go through the worlds collecting (suddenly a dirty word) tokens and tickets and fixing machines to get the park up and running again. The vehicles are everything from a customizable roller-coaster to a paintball tank that allows you to paint the town red, or any other color you choose. In standard platformer fashion, tickets are hidden in out-of reach places or held by characters who give them to you, after you beat them at their own game. The realtime physics engine makes it even more interesting with objects actually tumbling and falling like they would in real life.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>007: The World is Not Enough</em> is a James Bond game based on the 1999 movie of the same name. Both game and film follow Bond's investigation of attacks on a British oil tycoon's new pipeline, while the game introduces new areas and a backstory not seen in the film. James Bond is a MI5 agent that employs gadgets and gunplay, with each mission requiring the player to complete specific objectives outlined in a pre-mission briefing.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/45707/007-the-world-is-not-enough/\">PlayStation title</a> of the same name, this version is structured more like a successor to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Rare,+Ltd.\">Rare</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Goldeneye\">GoldenEye 007</a>. There are 14 missions with three difficulty settings (Agent, Special Agent, 00 Agent), and higher difficulty settings add increasingly complicated objectives to each mission. An \"awards\" system encourages replay by granting new multiplayer skins, maps, and modes for beating target times for single-player levels.</p>\n<p>The game includes a local, split-screen multiplayer mode for up to four players or a combination of computer-controlled bots. Some levels are taken from single-player mode, while others are exclusive to multiplayer. New game modes include King of the Hill, Capture The Briefcase, and Last Agent Standing. The notorious Golden Gun also returns from <em>GoldenEye 007</em>, and retains its one-shot-kill power. Weapon groups and victory conditions can be tweaked at the start of a multiplayer match.</p>",

Each of the eight planes (six regular and two bonus) features four different weapons: two have unlimited ammo, air mines and the special weapon are restricted to respectively ten and two uses per round. Before every of the eight regular and four bonus missions the player can choose between one of four characters and his aircraft (the other ones become his wingmen).</p>",

Four player games and a new two player mode are also available for play.</p>\n<p>In Battle Royale mode (four player), you race around different boards to earn the most stars and coins.  At the end of each round, you face it off in one of the mini-games, which can be chicken chases, snowball fights, or various other competitions.</p>\n<p>Duel mode allows play between just two people.  You still race around the board, but mini-games are only played when you land on a specific square.  Another play change is the addition of another character for your team, allowing tag team-style action in the game.</p>\n<p>Story mode is essentially the same as a Battle Royale, except your opponents are played by the computer.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The year is 2016. Humanity has been reduced to a few survivors inhabiting the orbital space station Omega. Over the course of the history, aliens visited the Earth every twenty-five years, \"harvesting\" humans as an organic material. Eventually, they launch an assault on the last remnants of the human race. But Adam Drake, a genetically engineered soldier, comes into possession of a time-traveling device. He uses it to travel to the time periods of human history when aliens performed their deadly attacks. The fate of humanity is in his hands.</p>\n<p><em>Body Harvest</em> is an action and driving game with a mission-based structure. The protagonist travels to various locations and eras (e.g. Greece during World War II, Siberia in the 1990s, etc.) with the goal of stopping alien invasions. Missions can be accessed by traveling to specified areas on the map. Adam can move on foot and use his weapons to kill aliens; however, vehicles usually prove to be a more reliable way of tackling most missions. Adam can use most of his weapons while in a vehicle; in addition, some vehicles are outfitted with their own weapons.</p>\n<p>Each vehicle has its own speed, armor, and fuel capacity attributes. Controllable vehicles range from armored cars and tanks to boats, helicopters, planes, and even a space ship during a few missions. Buildings scattered around levels may contain useful items, ammunition, and fuel. The player has to avoid killing innocent people; too many casualties result in a premature end of the game. Typically, the main goals in each area are to destroy the alien Shield Generator, defeat a boss enemy, and proceed to the next stage.</p>",

The Eletale Book has also been stolen, which preserves harmony in Celtland. Brian must find his father and bring back the Eletale Book. In his journey he will travel linearly through the land, passing through towns, dungeons, and paths filled with monsters.</p>\n<p><em>Quest 64's</em> combat exists in a mixture of turn-based and real-time inputs. In combat Brian and his opponents take turns moving and selecting spells to attack each other with. With luck and diligence attacks can sometimes be avoided manually. Brian has four schools of magic he can draw from; Air, Earth, Water, and Fire, and each can be strengthened with mana points gained from leveling or found in the world. Strengthening a school of magic makes it more powerful and unlocks new spells. Brian can carry items to heal or temporarily boost his stats, but there is no equipment in the game. The North American version of the game also has no in-game currency; some villagers will offer items, and free replacements if they are used, but items found in dungeons are used once and can never be replaced.</p>",

Without an ordinary cure for his illness, Alaron must set out on a journey with a selection of companions in search of the antidote. Little does Alaron know that the journey is even more dangerous then firstly thought, with a mysterious evil force brewing in the distance.</p>\n<p>In this 3D fantasy role-playing game, you must complete a set of quests, through the use of items and magic, while following a slightly non-linear storyline, choosing the order in what to embark tasks on. The game features two distinctive different modes: exploring and fighting. Alaron explores the game world freely, discovers special places and talks to the inhabitants. There are no random encounters but if he meets an enemy the game switches to the combat screen. Combat is basically turn-based but not in the way common in console RPGs: during a character's turn he can be moved in real-time in a circular way \u2014 the characters move constantly towards each other. When two rings intersect the characters can launch a regular or magic attack. The party selection (up to four characters) is pre-defined by the story.</p>",

But instead of relying on simply depleting the health bar, you must win points depending on how you defeat an opponent (for example, ring-outs are 1 point, special moves 4 points and countering a special move is 2 points). </p>\n<p>Game modes include the standard VS. mode, simply defeat everyone you see. VS. Battle allows you to defeat the enemy, then acquire their moves for the next round. The Master Challenge has you spinning a wheel to determine who you fight. Spin up a Master, and you get a tough challenge in which you can win new moves. Spin a Joker, and you simply have a challenge, with nothing to gain, but everything to lose.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The second rally racer from Kemco on the N64 provides a vastly different style of rally racing to the original Top Gear Rally.</p>\n<p>Along with the new option to join a rally racing team, who supports you through-out each championship cup you take part in. Money raised by each vistory or top place in the cups goes towards improving your car, or reparing any problems. If you take a wrong turn and damage a part of your car (which can be anything from tyres to a full engine), the repairs come out of your pocket, so driving carefully is important.\nNew sponsership deals and bigger team call ups will also come into play the better you race, allowing the chance to drive the more powerful rally cars and play for big money.</p>\n<p>Much like the real rally championship, you don't race against other cars in the cups. Instead, you must race the clock. Whoever clocks the best time for each stage will win the points and move on to the next stage and the bigger cup challenges.</p>\n<p>You can also take part in the usual arcade rally style against 4 other cars, with the first to get to the finish taking the points. 2 players can play as part of one team during a championship campaign, as well up to four players split screen in the arcade mode.</p>",

The brand new 3D engine, while sporting similar styled graphics that hark back to the 80's classic, also boasts fuller textures and greater mobility for the character.</p>",

You will have to race in the wet, which means further setup modification to cope with the reduced grip. You can also edit the level of car damage, the pit-car radio, and whether the CPU cars can collide. There are also Battle and Time Trial modes, with your best laptimes recorded.</p>",

But by getting some air and landing through rings, or pulling off stunts, you'll also pick up coins that will go towards upgrading your car.</p>\n<p>The cars themselves are a mix of the future and the past, with a hot rod style outside with a powerful new age engine inside. That power will go towards getting you over the line, with the use of speed boosts as well as shortcuts on the tracks helping you greatly.</p>\n<p>A 4 player split screen mode is also included, while you can compete in practice, quick race and the competitive League mode, as well as stunt modes that will test your stunt making skills on half pipes and large open tracks.</p>",

This weapon needs energy atoms to function, so Marvin has sent out his five minions to five different worlds to collect the energy atoms. Duck Dodgers, the brave space adventurer and the defender of Earth, must get to the atoms before Marvin's goons do, with the help of his side-kick Porky Pig. </p>\n<p><em>Duck Dodgers</em> is a 3D platformer based on the Warner Bros. cartoons starring the titular hero. Dodgers travels to various planets, each reflecting the theme of the corresponding Looney Tunes boss characters (e.g. an <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=middle+east\">Arabian Nights</a>-themed planet ruled by the evil dictator Hassan). The gameplay is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3533/super-mario-64/\">Super Mario 64</a>. Dodgers explores three-dimensional levels, jumps and double-jumps to avoid obstacles and reach higher areas, and defeats enemies by punching or butt-stomping them. Special items (such as ACME rockets or boxing gloves) can be picked up and used in combat. The player also participates in several mini-games, including a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pong\">Pong</a> variant and a first-person shooter section.</p>",

Controlling Doraemon, a robotic cat-like creature who can enter fantasy world through his dreams, and his three friends, you must retrieve the crystal pieces and prevent a powerful demon from conquering the world. You can switch between the five playable characters (Doraemon himself, Jaian the karaoke bully, Suneo the boxer, Shizuka, a girl who can jump very high, and Nobita the pea-shooter), each one of which has his/her own fighting style and abilities. Doraemon can upgrade himself by collecting various tools that will allow him to breath underwater, to fly, or to ride a winged dragon.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Star Soldier: Vanishing Earth</em> takes place in the far future, where you are the last hope for Earth, which is being attacked by an alien race. The game features a top-down 3D scroller, similar to that of the arcade games <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8560/1943-the-battle-of-midway/\">1943</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1317/raiden/\"> Raiden</a>. You can take control of different space crafts, each with different advantages and disadvantages, and different weapons. The rule is 1 hit-kill. After 3 lives, you have to restart the level. There is no saving feature, however a lengthy password is provided to you at the end of each level, so long you have the patience to put it in each time you turn off the game.</p>\n<p>Each level is about 3-5 minutes long, each with it's own tough boss at the end. Each level has its own secret path to take, depending on what you shoot (ex. shoot wall, reveal secret path). All levels lead up to a final boss in the end.</p>",

However, due to to the Nintendo 64's 3D capabilities, you'll encounter massive bosses and detailed worlds as you make your way through Japan. To attack, you can either hurl coins, or use each character's specific weapon, such as Goemon's trademark pipe. Two players can also play simultaneously and work together to beat foes, and you can even ride piggy-back onto your friend.</p>\n<p>There are also towns to explore, where you chat with villagers and explore various shops and houses for information and clues.

Everyone's relying on Goemon to save the day, but he hasn't even noticed what's happening! Can our hero stop the Shoguns before they do any more damage?</p>\n<p><em>Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon</em> is an action game with light RPG elements, similar in style to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=ocarina+of+time+64\">The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time</a>. It is also the first localized Goemon game since <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=legend+of+the+mystical+ninja\">The Legend of the Mystical Ninja</a> for the SNES. Players control Goemon and his friends as they make their way through Ancient Japan to stop the Peach Mountain Shoguns. You can talk to characters, whack enemies with your pipe (or hurl coins at them), visit a deranged fortune teller who shrieks out \"PLASMA!\" at random intervals for no reason, and more.</p>\n<p>Each member of the Goemon team can also learn a special ability to access new areas as players progress through the game. Goemon earns the \"Sudden Impact\" power, which lets him move blocks he normally couldn't, Ebisumaru can shrink to small sizes so he can pass through tiny cracks, Sasuke earns an extra high jump, and Yae gets the ability to transform into a Mermaid so that she can swim underwater.</p>\n<p>As usual, the gigantic roller-skating robot, Impact, makes an appearance. Players get to use him to trample down buildings and duke it out in first-person mode against gigantic mecha boss characters in a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Punch-Out!!+nes\">Punch-Out!!</a> style game.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the distant future, a small group of human exiles have been doomed to fight for survival on the edge of the galaxy. Through military strength, espionage, and deceit, a unified Terran government has maintained an uneasy peace. But as resources and fuel run short, the Confederate nations find themselves looking towards the rich worlds of their alien neighbors, the enigmatic Protoss. To further complicate matters, it seems that a previously unknown species-- the Zerg-- has entered Protoss space and is destroying everything in its path. The time for war has come.</p>\n<p>The N64 port of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/378/starcraft/\">StarCraft</a> is a real-time strategy game featuring three distinct races - Terrans, Protoss and Zerg. Controls have been adjusted for the gamepad, with several Hot-Key menus available, and resource gathering has been automated to limit the required number of options. However, it lacks the cutscenes and map editor of the original game.</p>\n<p>If the player has the Expansion Pack for the N64, the entire <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1421/starcraft-brood-war/\">Brood War</a> expansion is also available. One player can play with up to 7 bots on a random map, or 2 players can team up in co-operative mode (with the N64 Expansion Pack) or go head to head with up to 6 other bots for total mayhem.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Xena: Warrior Princess - Talisman of Fate</em> is based on the TV-series Xena: Warrior Princess. The Nintendo 64 version of the series tie-in is a fighting game, unlike its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/19039/xena-warrior-princess/\">PlayStation counterpart</a>.</p>\n<p>The whole Xena universe is used in the game as all the levels and characters, except the new boss character, are familiar to the fans of the show. The action takes place in arenas which represent different kinds of surroundings with all the characters having their \"own\" level.</p>\n<p>The fighting is done with various weapons each character wielding his/her trademark weapon such as Xena's chakram, Gabrielle's staff and Callisto's sword. It includes most of the standard fighting-game modes such as story, vs. and training as well as a roster mode, where each player picks a succession of characters rather than just one.</p>\n<p>The fighting system is somewhat different from more traditional games. The most obvious difference is that four players are allowed instead of two. It can be a team battle or a free-for-all. The analog stick moves characters around on the ground in two dimensions, with separate buttons for block, jump and duck. The C-buttons handle attacks. Special moves are accomplished mostly by pulling the analog stick either toward your opponent, then away or vice-versa.</p>",

        "description": "<p>It was school holidays, and the Twinkle gang of schoolkids sailed to an island where they found a cave with crayons hidden inside. They split them among the group, but before they had finished, a bully came and stole the pack along with the last two crayons! He drew a mischievous-looking character, who came to life and said \"Let's cause trouble!\" Twinkle Town was terrified of the bully and his crayon character, so the Twinkle gang decided to draw their own superheroes to stop the bully!</p>\n<p><em>Rakugakids</em> is a 2D fighting game, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3679/marvel-vs-capcom-clash-of-super-heroes/\">Marvel Vs. Capcom</a>. You select from a variety of hand-drawn cartoon characters, and fight using low, middle and high punches and kicks. As you'd expect with this type of game, special button combinations yield special, more powerful moves. There is also a 'crayon meter' that fills the more you attack your opponent - when it is completely filled, you can pull off a devastating special move.</p>\n<p>The kids' characters are a lively bunch, full of an assortment of crazy moves. There's Robot C.H.O., who is a robot that turns into different metal objects on the fly, such as a car, garbage can, rocket, and more. There's BearTank, which is a green teddy bear with gun turrets on it. Captain.Cat.Kit is a DJ cat with slick basketball moves who also attacks with a variety of musical instruments.</p>\n<p>An interesting feature of Rakugakids is that Story Mode can be played by using \"Training Mode\". In this mode, you select a character, and train them up by playing matches against any character you like. It is beneficial to train more, because you can choose to play Story Mode in 'Battle Mode'. This mode automatically plays the game for you using your trained up character. If you've trained enough, your character will react to opponent attacks in the same way that you yourself would.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Weasels have kidnapped Pluto while he was wearing his diamond collar! All that was left of him was a ransom note showing the Weasels driving him away in a van. Mickey rounds up all of his friends (and even Pete wants to get in on the action!), and Professor Von Drake soups up their race cars so that they can catch up with the Weasels as they go on a cross-country tour of the United States. The Weasels have also stolen four parts of the Professor's top-secret racer, and hidden them in four of the tracks. Once players find all these pieces, they can catch up with the Weasels in the final showdown.</p>\n<p><em>Mickey's Speedway USA</em> is a kart racer from Rare based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3582/diddy-kong-racing/\">Diddy Kong Racing</a> game engine. Players compete in circuits of four races, grand prix style, and the player with the most points at the end of all four races wins the gold trophy. There are six initial racers, but only three sets of stats shared between them. Minnie and Daisy are lightweight and good for beginners, Mickey and Donald are both all-around characters, while Pete and Goofy are the slow but fast heavyweights.</p>\n<p>The game has an assortment of pickups - there's the Carbo Spritzer, a soda-powered turbo; the Paint Splotcher, which launches a slippery blob of paint onto the track; the Baseball Chucker, which launches an explosive baseball onto the track; and the Magno Flyer, which sends a remote control plane to seek the nearest opponent, to name a few. There are also 'Oomph Tokens' scattered on the track - the first ten of these tokens increase your racer's maximum speed a little.</p>\n<p>As well as the main game, Mickey's Speedway USA also features a Time Trial mode (where you race against the clock), a Practice mode (where you can drive all around a farmyard course to practice your skills), and Contest mode (which functions like the famous Battle Mode in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3535/mario-kart-64/\">Mario Kart 64</a> - players must pop their opponents' three balloons before they lose all of their own). The game is also Transfer Pak compatible with the Game Boy Color version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Mickeys+Speedway+USA\">Mickey's Speedway USA</a>.</p>",

It combines a trick-oriented snowboard simulator with shooting/arcade elements. </p>\n<p>Player can choose from various characters with different look and skills. There are different gaming modes, including a story mode with very light and entertaining plot. The storyline is actually quite basic, sometimes similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Kirby\">Kirby series</a> concepts. Hence, there is no rush for saving the world, just some funny little fellas entertaining themselves. </p>\n<p>Winning a race or performing tricks provides the player with some credit which can be spent on improved equipment. Shooting elements are based on but not limited to throwing strange objects (like parachutes or snow-men) against other snowboard kids in order to slow them down. There are great power-ups during the gameplay. Courses are rarely covered with snow - most of the races are held in freakish regions like jungles, space stations, castles etc.</p>",

The game allows you to speak directly to Pikachu via the Voice Recognition Unit (VRU) included with the game, in order to tell Pikachu what to do and help direct the adventures the two of you embark on.</p>\n<p>The game features 20 different minigames which you and Pikachu play together. Some involve you catching water Pok\u00e9mon, while another might send you search for ingredients for stew. When the minigame is over, you go back home and sleep, waking up the next day to play another game. As the game progresses more of the features and minigames are unlocked, and Pikachu's friendship meter will grow.</p>\n<p>Pikachu will understand around 200 different words or simple phrases like \"come here\", \"stop that\", and \"eat it\". Voice communication is the primary method of interacting with the game, though the analog stick is used for navigation.</p>",

As Doshin you may wander the Island helping native worshippers by bringing them trees altering land, fending off disasters and repulsing marauding monsters. The more you help the larger you grow... However it's not easy always being so nice.</p>\n<p>With the touch of a button you become the feared Jyashin! A red winged demon whose only wish is to destroy. Using fireballs and his great strength you'll level whole civilizations to feed of the islanders hate and grow larger. By no means is the object of the game just to grow, you know that the villagers must build 16 monuments in your honor... However you possess a knowledge, an almost instinctual one, that when this happens a horrible fate will meet the island. Will you chose to forever serve and torment the populace or will you help build the monuments that you know must be built?</p>\n<p>The game allows you to do whatever you like within the limits of Doshin's abilities. Want to build a mountain, go for it. Want to be genocidal, the world is your oyster. After half an hour of gameplay the sun will set and Doshin will \"die\" for the night, and when you start the next day you will have shrunk to your starting size. The only goal is to influence the villagers to build monuments in your name, whether they build out of devotion or fear is up to you.</p>",

Reluctantly you comply. Yet sleep is the last thing you will be doing, for as soon as the lights go off and your head hits the pillow you are transformed into a shadow child and whisked to another world. In this world the Doshin Expo 1996 is being held, and it's main attraction is going to be the execution of Doshin himself for crimes against the Bardo Islanders! Say it ain't so! </p>\n<p>All is not lost, however, you have the chance to save your yellow hero. His strength has been sapped by the Expo's eternal night, however, you can give him the energy he needs to grow by \"tinkling\" on him, more specifically you will have to fill your smiling heart shaped bladder with love \"tinkle\".</p>\n<p>To obtain this you must speak to women who run pavilions at the expedition. They will give you tasks to do in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/31053/kyojin-no-doshin-1/\">Kyojin no Doshin 1</a>. You will have to swap game cartridges to do these tasks. As you complete these tasks you will be treated to segments of an animation called \"More Than Giant\" which explain how Doshin was captured and served with his horrible sentence.</p>\n<p>Go \"tinkle\" on Doshin, help him grow and break free, there may be villainous female bikers, and so called \"Island Nurturers\", that rule the eternal night, looking to do him in but you can overcome!</p>",

You have to escape the prison and get the band back together in order to participate to the \"Battle of the Bands\" competition.</p>\n<p>You can accomplish that by jumping over obstacles, beating a lot of people and collecting coins, notes, wrenches, keys and what not in four levels: Prison, Chicago, Graveyard &amp; Swamp. After each level you will free one member of the band. Additionally, the game designers threw in some rhythm-based action: sometimes you have to press the right buttons at the right time in order to proceed. The game features multiplayer, but you only get to play the rhythm mini-game.</p>",

You also have four mini-games, \"Tennis Court Bingo\", \"Burning Barrels\", \"Run and Gun\" &amp; \"Knock'em Down\", where your goal is to hit certain objects in the tennis field. You can win special prices for getting enough points.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you have a special challenge mode where you have to play against your opponent in odd conditions: your tennis field might be rotating, made of ice or be about to explode, to name a few. Beat your foe and you will be rewarded with a piece clothing or item of your choice from your opponent's dressing room. Lose and you lose the item that your opponent picks. Keep on losing and you will have to play your games wearing nothing but your underwear, which makes the game like a sort of family-friendly strip tennis.</p>",

You get to choose between eight different attack choppers, each having its own strengths and weaknesses. </p>\n<p>After the briefing from your XO, you are set to destroy something \u2014tanks, other helicopters, planes, radars, buildings etc. While the mission only requires you to do something specific, destroying everything gives you bonuses and money, which you can then use to buy more heavy-duty missiles between the missions.</p>\n<p>If you look at the screenshots, you might think that Chopper Attack is a helicopter simulation. It's not. Your elevation is fixed. There are no physics. You have boss fights against giant choppers. The game is pure and plain 3D action.</p>",

In fact, both games were done with the very same editor. </p>\n<p>Designing 3D models, doing textures and composing a hit song are no small tasks mind you, so if you are more of the impatient type, you can skip the editor and head straight for the two sample games, <em>Solid Gear</em> and <em>Usagi</em>. Both games are shooters, but that is the only thing they have in common. </p>\n<p><em>Solid Gear</em> is a \"serious\" (and a difficult) shooter, where you are in a middle of a war, shooting enemy warships, tanks and even mechs. </p>\n<p><em>Usagi</em> is your typically untypical Japanese weirdness where you must defend yourself against robots, missiles... and bunnies.

        "description": "<p><em>Clay Fighter: Sculptor's Cut</em> is a parody of one-on-one fighting games and features sixteen playable clay fighters, including Sumo Santa, Statue of Liberty, Booger Man and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Earthworm+Jim\">Earthworm Jim</a>. It is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8509/clay-fighter-63-13/\">Clay Fighter 63 1/3</a>.</p>\n<p>Like the title suggests, it is not an entirely new game but rather a different version of it. The most notable differences are the four extra playable characters and betterments in the 2D-style camera angle. You cannot perform unlimited combos anymore either.</p>\n<p>Moves are a mix of standard punches and kicks (although not all of the contestants have hands or legs) and a large number of special moves specific to each and combos. You can sometimes interact with your environment by kicking your opponent through a door or window and continue on the other side. You can also end the fights with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Mortal+Kombat\">Mortal Kombat</a>-style \"Claytalities\".</p>",

The game will then take you to a screen where each of the 4 players can select an action before a turn starts. An action can be viewing the dates you have, finding out each girl's interests or selecting a destination and initiating the turn. By doing that you will be transported to a 3D depiction of the map where you will view random events for all 4 players. Events are usually triggered when you find a girl at the location that you visited the given time and from there you can talk with that girl and if your relationship experience with that girl is high you can give her gifts and ask her for dates. When all players' events are over the turn ends (1 day passes) and the same procedure is repeated until the girl's love meter is high enough for you to express your feelings for her.</p>",

On each board the objective is to find a missing item.</p>\n<p>In Angelica's Temple of Gloom you have to beat Angelica in reaching various pieces of an Aztec statue. The Pirate Treasure hunt requires the Rugrats to travel underwater to find buried treasure. The Reptar Rally lets them collect candy on Candy Island.</p>\n<p>The game can be played with up to four players (or NPC players). Each turn you can move as many paces as you got on the spinner (a replacement for dice). Some tiles have special actions attached to them that let you move further or gain or lose cookies. Each Rugrat also has limited energy, when they move a lot they get tired and have to take a nap to regain energy. You can collect Toy Cards to open doors or use against friends to gain an edge.</p>",

It covers the major battles from the entire <em>Evangelion</em> saga and features original footage from the anime. </p>\n<p>In <em>Story Mode</em> the player takes control of bio-mechanical mechas called Evas to fight against monstrous beings called Angels. To see every mission through, combo attacks (punches and kicks), blocking and grappling techniques are available at the pilot's disposal. Depending on the damage the player's Eva takes and if certain parameters are met during that time the player will be given a time limit in which they must end the battle with the Angel. </p>\n<p>The <em>Simulation Mode</em> almost plays like a shooter. It\u2019s a 1st-person perspective mode where the player must eliminate as many Angels as possible within the time limit. When the time limit ends a rank is assigned depending on how many enemies were destroyed and how many bullets were used.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Air Boarder 64</em> is a game that resembles skateboarding games like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tony+Hawk\">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> but with a certain aspect of it being quite different. Instead of the usual skateboards the game features hover boards.</p>\n<p>The single-player option features the following modes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Lecture: the mode where you can learn the controls and the terms the game uses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Street Work: the main mode of the game. At the beginning there are 4 available characters (others become available later), 5 stages and 4 boards (with more available later) from which you can choose. In each stage you are given a time limit in which you must perform as many tricks as possible with your board. There are also yellow circles lying around that you must pass through. Each time you pass through one the timer resets back and, if you pass through all them, the game ends regardless of how much time is left. When the game ends you get a rank depending on the points you accumulated and if the rank is high enough a level of higher difficulty is unlocked (with a total of 3 difficulty levels per stage).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Time Attack: you must pass through all the coloured circles in a designated order and within the littlest time possible. The spots where the circles are can be seen in a map that appears onscreen.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Coin: mode in which you must get all the coins that are scattered in the stage within the time limit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Free Run: this mode is free of challenges (no time limit or points) and mostly serves as a means of getting you acquainted with stages.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Two-players option features the following modes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Vs. Race: a race where the one that passes through all of the yellow circles in the order that is specified wins.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Vs. Coin: a mode where the player who gets all the coins or has more of them when the time ends wins.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

There are six characters (plus three unlockable) to choose from, each with different skills and three modes in total \u2014two of them are single-player and the other one is a multiplayer one.* Championship: in Championship you can select one of the available players and choose the style you want \u2014ski or snowboard. You can also change each player\u2019s equipment which includes ski/snowboard and clothes. The game also lets you choose in which stage you want to compete and the race type you want to play. Race Type includes three options \u2014Free Ride, Slalom and Giant Slalom. In Free Ride you compete against 3 CPU-controlled players, you must finish first and before time, which is increased at every checkpoint, runs out. In Slalom and Giant Slalom you must pass through the flags that are scattered throughout the course and again like in Free Ride finish first. The differences between Slalom and Giant Slalom are the latter's course being wider and presenting less flags. By successfully completing any of the above your character's skills \u2014 like cornering, acceleration, etc. \u2014 are increased.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>2P Battle: in 2P Battle two human players can compete in any of the Free Ride/Slalom/Giant Slalom races. It is possible to either choose a player from the game or load a previously saved player data from a Controller Pak. There are also no restrictions on the style each player will choose. For example one may choose to play with a skier and the other with a snowboarder.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Time Attack: there is no other competition in this mode than between you and time.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

New parts can be taken from the other cars at the end of each race but only if you are among the first three racers that cross the finish line. Also, each part has points and the sum of these points must not exceed the point limit for each difficulty. For example a basic brake part may add one point to the total sum (better parts add more points). If with all the other parts the sum of points exceeds a lets say point limit of six then you are not allowed to enter the race.

To fish you need to find a suitable spot and after catching a fish you can keep it to a water tank and feed it.</p>\n<p>While walking random encounters can occur at any time in which you are transferred at a different screen and have the choice of either throwing stuff like rocks at the enemy to chase them away or run across a path-like bar to reach to safety and end the battle. If you choose to do the latter you are vulnerable as the enemy is able to attack you and have your health depleted.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The basic concept remains unchanged in this N64 installment of the series - it's a turned based strategy game where the player commands robots and pilots from various Japanese shows, for example Dancouga and different Gundam series, as well as Banpresto originals. Newly introduced are Six God Combination Godmars, Giant Robo and Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the game, the player is offered a choice out of four pairs of protagonists/rivals, which affects the plot and the stages played. With the different variations included, there are over 100 missions.</p>\n<p>During the stages, the player moves his units over a map, attacking enemies and using special abilities. When getting attacked, player units may defend, counter, or attempt to evade, resulting in no damage at all if successful. Destroyed enemies give experience and money for upgrading between the missions. Often, scripted events happen, such as reinforcements arriving. Sometimes it's also possible to persuade certain characters to join the player's side, in addition to those that join automatically. Certain, otherwise unobtainable units, can also be unlocked by using the N64 Transfer Pak in combination with the Gameboy Color game <em>Super Robot Wars: Link Battler</em>.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Super Robot Spirits</em> is a one-against-one fighting game featuring big robots from the <em>Super Robot Wars</em> game series and anime TV series. The background story is basically about an mysterious force attacking Earth and the robot pilots battle it out to determine who fights the evil robots in the end. How the story plays out in detail depends on which of the seven characters is used in story mode. The selectable characters are the protagonists' mecha from the series <em>Daitarn 3</em>, <em>Dancougar</em>, <em>G Gundam</em>, <em>Dunbine</em>, <em>Xabungle</em> and <em>Voltes V</em> plus the R-1 from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Shin+Super+Robot+Taisen\">Shin Super Robot Taisen</a>. By meeting certain conditions while playing, three more characters can be unlocked, including one that makes its debut in this game.</p>\n<p>The gameplay itself follows the genre standards: both opponents can perform a set of standard and special attacks (the latter executed with certain button combinations). Every hit causes the energy bar to go down and whoever runs out first, loses. When a timer runs out, the one with the most energy left wins. Each fighter also has a second energy meter which can be used to perform especially powerful attacks. The robots also can fly which changes the available attack range. The playing modes are story, vs (two players), 64 (same as story mode without the story), Guts (fighting one opponent after another until the energy runs out), time attack (defeating opponents in a short time) and training.</p>",

Besides this there is also a battle mode available in which up to four opponents walk over one of four areas and try to shoot the others over the edge.

This all is commentated by an enthusiastic announcer. Multiplayer is a simple split-screen race.</p>",

As in the original sport, goal of the relatively short matches (measured in seconds) is to push the opponent out of the fighting area. The game uses 3D areas, the analogue stick for movement and C-button combinations to perform moves. Besides exhibition matches and various tournaments there also is a career mode which features decisions and minigames between matches, which influence the sumo wrestler's statistics, for example choosing the diet or fishing. The game uses a comic look and some of the eight areas feature unusual places such as the Moon or Egypt.</p>",

The goal is to create full lines which then disappear, reward points and cause the game to become more difficult over time. The game is lost when the appearing stone can't be moved anymore because the screen is full. B-Type is similar but the screen gets filled with random block combinations from the ground.</p>\n<p>In addition to this standard mode, the game features two unique variants: In \"Giga Tetris\" the player occasionally has to deal with huge blocks which break up when touching the ground. \"Bio Tetris\" makes use of the bio sensor accessory which was included with the game: it is clipped into the user's ear and measures the heart rate. It can be set if the game slows down or speeds up when the heart rate rises.</p>",

It is an adaption of the Western <em>Game of Life</em>, but the game has more similarities to <em>Monopoly</em>.</p>\n<p>It is primarily aimed at multiple players and focuses on the financial success of the participants. After choosing one of the playing boards, the players throw their dices in turns. Then the player moves forward on the board by a distance depending on the result of the dice throw. Each field represents a business or lot which can be bought if the player has enough money at hand. If another player lands on the same field, a rent has to be payed up. This all influences the stock value of the player's company.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>SimCity 64</em> continues Nintendo's use of the general <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=SimCity\">SimCity</a> game with their own addition of more cartoonish and Nintendo related elements. The relationship between <em>SimCity 64</em> and the SNES version can be seen by the reappearance of the earlier game's green haired tutorialmonger <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/simcity/screenshots/gameShotId,277038/\">Doctor Wright</a> [Dr.\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8]. </p>\n<p>The gameplay is similar to <em>SimCity</em>, where the player zones certain areas for commercial, residential or industrial use, and then builds the civic infrastructure to support their growth. The city will develop in accordance with the roads, power structures, police stations, etc. that the player builds. However, in a twist, the player can then shrink their nigh omniscient overhead perspective into a first-person, citizen-on-the-streets view. While in this perspective, other Sims can be interacted with. They will tell the player about their lives and neighborhoods. Sighting a gun toting criminal on the sidewalk is a good indicator that more police stations need to be constructed. These city dwellers are rendered as cartoon sprites.</p>\n<p>Apart from the ability to walk the streets there is some additional city interactivity available in the first-person perspective.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At airports, the player can now access a helicopter.

        "description": "<p><em>PGA European Tour</em> is a golf game that makes use of the official European Tour license. It offers only four courses, specifically Quinta do Lago in Portugal, Kungs\u00e4ngen in Sweden, Druids Glen and the K Club in Ireland. Players can choose to play a quick match, a non-tour golf game or participate in the real tour. The non-tour option includes several modes: in Strokeplay players need to get the least number of strokes in order to win, in Matchplay the goal is to win more holes, while in Skins holes are played for money (winners of holes one to six get 100 euros, seven to twelve - 200 euros, thirteen to eighteen - 300 euros). Up to four players can play non-tour games, and some options allow teams of two to face each other.</p>\n<p>Participation in the tour itself is a simulation of the real thing. Players start as amateurs, and can select to play as one of 64 European golfers like Nick Faldo and Jose Maria Olazabal, or create their own custom character. To reach professional status it's necessary to reduce the handicap to zero and finish in the top 8 of the Amateur Challenge Tour. Reaching the top 8 of the Professional Challenge Tour guarantees an entry to the European Tour Qualifying School, the final hurdle before advancing to the European Tour. In order to keep playing there one must not fall out of the top 32 golfers in the rankings.</p>",

In each, various rule options can be set, including popular house rules like the free parking pot, double money for landing on GO and having to go around once before starting buying, while standard rules like the even build rule, the auctioning of unsold properties and rent immunity in trading can be switched off. Players can be set between two and four, with the computer filling out any number of positions. The personality of the computer opponents can be set in four levels, from cautious to intelligent. Eleven tokens are available, including the money bag, introduced to the game in 1998 by popular vote.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is seen in 3D, with an animated roll of the dice, the tokens moving around the board (the walking animations can be turned off), and Mr. Monopoly holding up Chance and Community cards. The camera can be set to five different positions during token movement, and there is a free camera mode for inspecting assets. The game can be saved between turns.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Power Rangers: Lightspeed Rescue</em> is one of several different games based on the 2000 incarnation of the franchise. This time, the Power Rangers are recruited to protect the city of Mariner Bay against the evil Diabolico and his minions.</p>\n<p>The game's main story mode is called Titanium Quest and consists of three episodes that have to be taken on in order, each consisting of a number of missions, for over 30 missions in total. The missions are of one of four different types.</p>\n<p>The Ranger levels are seen from an angled top-down perspective. A pre-determined Ranger is tasked with either rescuing a number of innocents or removing dangerous obstacles within a time limit. A radar map shows the way to the next objective. Enemy goons that stand in the way can be taken out by shooting an energy burst. Power-ups can be collected that enable more powerful shots, short-time invisibility or enhanced armor, health upgrades and more. Occasionally, the Ranger levels feature boss fights against more powerful enemies.</p>\n<p>The driving levels are seen from the side. A Ranger-controlled vehicle drives from left to right and must put out fires, rescue civilians or clean up radioactive spills while avoiding traffic and shooting at enemy vehicles. There is a time limit and power-ups can be collected to restore health lost through attacks or crashes.</p>\n<p>The Megazord levels are one-on-one battles that pit the Ranger's Megazord mech against one powerful boss enemy. Perspective can be switched between first- and third-person. The goal is to destroy the enemy with missiles or, if close enough, with melee attacks. Blocking is possible and power-ups can be picked up to restore health or increase firepower.</p>\n<p>The final type of level are flying levels in which players control the Green Ranger's hovercraft. In these, the goal is once more to rescue innocents or alternatively, collect a number of items. The hovercraft is seen from behind and can freely move through a 3D environment. As in the Ranger levels, there is a radar map that shows the way to the next objective and a time limit.</p>\n<p>A two-player mode is also available, which consists of a split-screen variant of the Megazord battles. Characters to use in this mode must be unlocked by progressing in the single-player game.</p>\n<p>Comic-style illustrations advance the storyline between levels.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Zool</em> is a JRPG based around Monster collecting, taking clear influences popular series like Dragon Quest and Pok\u00e9mon. The word Zool is meant to be a combination of Zoo and School.</p>\n<p>The story opens with the orhan 10 year old main character, named Leo by default, finding a hatched baby monster of a rare breed in the forest. It follows him home so he keeps it and and names it \u30d0\u30fc\u30cb\u30a3(B\u0101nyi or Bernie) by default. Monsters and humans generally live together, but there are friendly competitions held each year to decide the best monster battler, with these competitions drawing in more legendary rare monsters which are desirable for the villains. The first plotline conflict is Leo is pursued by Roche, a rare monster collector and his 2 henchmen Matt &amp; Mitt who try to steal his new friend, with more characters and villains showing up throughout the game.</p>\n<p>The game is split into two main sections, towns and the overworlds/dungeons segments. Inside towns players move a cursor around to select which building they want to visit, there is no free roam in these sections. Towns consist of the many homes and taverns of villagers who must often be talked to in order to progress the storyline, shops for buying and selling items, various houses and inns to save progress and heal, and monster daycares for players to store monsters they collect. Exiting a town brings players to the overworld where random battles occur and new towns, dungeons, and other landmarks that can be reached by foot. At certain points players enter labyrinthine 3D dungeons where the players can walk up to doors, treasure items, and must find their way to the end. Keys must be found in item bags, desk drawers, or chests. </p>\n<p>Battles are automatic with monsters making their own choices after a small period of time passes. Players can only blow their whistle to directly order a monster, which costs musical notes on the bottom of the screen which regenerate over time.</p>\n<p>Players have 4 commands via the 4 C-buttons: C-Up=Attack, C-Left=Magic, C-Right=Defend, C-Down=Attempt to flee battle. Each monster only has 1 attack and 1 magic move, and since items can't be used in battles most attacks happen slowly in real time so players have opportunities to defend.</p>\n<p>Players can have 4 monsters in a party and hold 8 monsters total in their inventory. The blue Bagny however cannot be removed from the players party. Other monsters must be taken to the monster storage establishments where they can be kept or deleted. Each monster can also have up to 2 pieces of equipment placed on them.</p>\n<p>At the end of every battle players earns experience points for themselves and each monster used. Also dropped by enemies is Pom which is money, items, etc. After being defeated players must view the opponents stats, and choose if they want to try and recruit them for their team which is based on the monsters negotiation stat &amp; level. This mirrors the recruitment mechanics popularized by Dragon Quest V in 1992. Later on players get a journal for keeping a catalog of the 168 monsters in the game, though it's only about 50 with most monsters just having 3 color variations.</p>\n<p>Storywise Zool is extremely text heavy and can be difficult to enjoy because of the Japanese text, though its gameplay is seemingly balanced for children as it is extremely easy and barebones with its combat.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Fushigi no Dungeon: F\u016brai no Shiren 2: Oni Sh\u016brai! Shiren-j\u014d!</em> is the second game in the Shiren the Wanderer series which is part of Chunsoft's Mystery Dungeon series, and its only appearance on the Nintendo 64 platform.</p>\n<p>The game is a traditional Roguelike game where you navigate through randomized maps to slay monsters, collect experience and items to accomplish certain tasks. When you die you can retain one item while experience is lost, there might however be ways to increase the number of items retained. You move in a turn-based grid like way where faster enemies are symbolized by getting multiple moves by turn, rather than actually faster movement.</p>\n<p>Set before the events of the first game, Shiren and his weasel Kappa, on the way to the mountains, passes by the village of Natane, where they stop to eat. While eating a tribe of Demons attack. Pushing back against the attack Shiren decides to build a castle to defend the villagers from further attacks. The game revolves around building Castle Shiren. To do this you must seek out rare materials through the multiple dungeons that make up the game. Any progress to this meta goal is saved and progress is not redacted if you die on a run. Certain events trigger monsters to attack the village which you must help defend.</p>\n<p>The game was originally planned to be a N64DD title, but development was later moved to the base N64.</p>",

Officially licensed from the Japan Golf Tour association, it features a substantial lineup of real-world players using their 1998 data. Players can also create their own custom players and save that data on the game disk. Ten different officially-licensed golf courses from across Japan are playable, featuring accurate recreations of their real-world topography.</p>\n<p>In addition to a single-player tournament mode, there are several different multiplayer modes. Two players can play together in a Match Play mode, and up to four can play together in the 18-hole Stroke Play mode. An online mode uses the 64DD's built-in modem to compete in a cross-country tournament with other players.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Eik\u014d no St. Andrews</em> is an immersive golf game that takes players on a journey through one of the oldest and most iconic golf courses in the world. Released in 1996 for the Nintendo 64 console in Japan only, this game offers players the unique opportunity to play a round of golf on the legendary \"Old Course\" at St Andrews, Scotland, which was established back in 1552.</p>\n<p>As players start the game, they are greeted with stunning visuals that capture the lush green fairways and beautiful landscapes of the course. The game features realistic sound effects that mimic the sound of clubs hitting the ball and the gentle rustling of the wind through the trees.</p>\n<p>Players can choose to play as one of several well-known golfers, each with their unique strengths and weaknesses. As they progress through the game, they can unlock new characters, clubs, and equipment that can help them improve their game and achieve their goal of winning the championship.</p>\n<p>The game features several modes, including stroke play, match play, and tournament play. In stroke play, players aim to complete each hole in as few strokes as possible. Match play involves competing against an opponent, with the goal of winning more holes than the opponent. In tournament play, players compete against a large group of opponents, with the goal of achieving the lowest overall score.</p>\n<p>Players must navigate through each hole, avoiding obstacles like bunkers, rough terrain, and water hazards. They can use a variety of clubs, including drivers, irons, and putters, to help them make their way through the course. Each shot requires careful consideration of the wind speed and direction, the slope of the terrain, and the distance to the hole.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Hamster Monogatari 64</em> is a virtual pet simulation game and is a part of the \"Hamster Monogatari\" series; the only one that was released on the Nintendo 64 platform. </p>\n<p>In the game, players take care of and raise their own hamsters. There are ten different types of hamsters to choose from, each with its own unique personality and appearance. Players must feed, play with, and take care of their hamsters to keep them healthy and happy. If you neglect their needs, they may become ill or injured. In that case, you can take them to the hospital to get treated.</p>\n<p>To improve your hamsters' lives, you can visit the shop to purchase useful items or seek advice from the old shop owner. However, you need to be careful before buying anything because you can't return items once purchased. You can also enter your adult hamsters into competitions, either races or beauty competitions, where they can win prize money. But before entering, you need to check the calendar and apply in advance. If you have two adult hamsters of different genders, you can breed them in the breeding case. However, each hamster has a different personality, and if they are not compatible, it may not go well. Moreover, even if you put two hamsters in the breeding case, they may not necessarily have a pup.</p>\n<p>One of the unique features of the game is the \"Watch your Hamsters\" option, where you can interact with your hamsters by petting them or teaching them tricks using your hand on the screen. With each week, you can advance to the next week and confirm your Hamster Raising Plan. Your mother will also give you 1000 yen every month to help with your hamster-raising expenses.</p>\n<p>The game's story revolves around a young protagonist who can talk to hamsters. The game's concept may seem familiar to fans of the manga and anime \"Hamtaro,\" but <em>Hamster Monogatari 64</em> offers its own unique take on the concept. The story is set in a fantasy world where hamsters and their human owners live together. Players can enter this world by climbing down a hole in a big tree in a nearby forest.</p>",

The game is set in a bright and colorful pachinko parlor where players can experience the thrill of playing one of Japan's most popular pastimes.</p>\n<p>The game's objective is to gather basic knowledge about all the machines, combine that with knowledge about how the parlors operate, and which machines are paying out the most, then use that knowledge to exploit the game and win as much as possible.</p>\n<p>In the game, players control a small ball that they shoot into a pachinko machine, a vertical pinball-like device. The ball bounces around the machine, hitting various pins and bumpers, and eventually falls into a scoring pocket. Players earn points based on where the ball lands, and can potentially win more balls to continue playing.</p>\n<p><em>Heiwa Pachinko World 64</em> features a wide variety of pachinko machines, each with its own unique theme and gameplay mechanics. Players can choose from machines featuring popular anime and video game characters, as well as traditional Japanese motifs like cherry blossoms and koi fish. There are four machines featured: CR Success Story SP, Lemon Pie, CR Dama-chan House, and Bijyo Daishugo 2. The game allows you to check the pins with a free camera and offers a complete simulation with virtual parlors.</p>\n<p>In addition to the standard pachinko gameplay, Heiwa Pachinko World 64 also includes a number of mini-games and challenges. For example, players can compete in a race to see who can score the most points in a set amount of time, or try to hit a series of specific targets to earn a bonus prize. The game offers three modes: Training Mode, where the jackpot probability is twice as high as the real machines, and you start playing with 500,000 yen; Battle Mode, where the jackpot probability is the same as the real machines, and you start with 100,000 yen; and Study Mode, where you can view things like the machines' rules, data, and Super Reach types.</p>",

The Tsurikon 64 controller was shaped like a fishing reel and had a rod attached to it. The player would use the rod to cast their line and reel in fish, just like real fishing. The controller also had a small LCD screen that displayed information such as the time of day and the fish's weight, making the fishing experience more immersive. The Tsurikon 64 controller also had a vibration feature that would simulate the feeling of a fish biting the hook, which added to the realism of the game. The controller's buttons were used to select lures and perform other actions, and the joystick was used to control the movement of the line and the reel.</p>",

On their turn, players roll a die and advance that many spaces on the board, even over already traveled tiles. Depending on where they land, they can collect clues, manage stats, etc. Should two players land on the same space, they duel with whatever cards they've collected until that point.</p>",
