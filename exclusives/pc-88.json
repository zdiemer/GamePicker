        "description": "<p>The year is 1983. Your helicopter has had to make an emergency landing in Africa, but you've landed in an exceptionally dangerous place: the village where Donkey Kong's descendants live. You've been chased up into a palm tree and are hanging on a rope, but the apes aren't going to leave you be, so you're going to have to defend yourself!</p>\n<p><em>Donkey Gorilla</em> is a basic action game where the player controls the stranded character hanging from a rope tied between palm trees. On the ground are a number of primates, and they must be eliminated before they can climb the tree and cut the rope. There is also a bat that flies overhead, attacking from above, but will sometimes fly low enough to be shot. Only a direct hit to the head will kill an ape, and if the player is killed either by the apes or the bat above, all apes on that stage will return. If the player can eliminate all the apes, then play continues on the next stage with a different formation of apes.</p>",

It includes many recognizable elements from the original game, including the three types of weapons, enemy patterns, and even the large bosses that can be destroyed piece-by-piece, all rendered in chunky blue-and-white text. Just as the original game, there are three weapon types, each of them upgradable, as well as screen-clearing bombs (which look like flashing skulls), and multiple stages each with a boss at the end. The game also features a bizarre running commentary on the side of the screen by a square-headed face.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Shiry\u014d Sensen - War of the Dead: Browning no Fukkatsu</em> is based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Shiry%C5%8D+Sensen+-+War+of+the+Dead\"> original  MSX release</a> of <em>War of the Dead</em>. The two versions are similar in terms of concept, story, graphical style, and general gameplay mechanics, but significantly differ in several aspects. </p>\n<p>The world map layout of this version is completely different from that of the original version. Several locations have been altered, removed, or added. The pacing has been therefore considerably changed, as the protagonist has to travel different distances; some of the main quests involving rescuing the survivors have also been altered. The map is more open and less maze-like; the fires blocking the path in many spaces have been completely removed. The PC-88 version also removes the day/night cycle and the ability to sleep.</p>\n<p>Gameplay-wise, this version has underwent some simplification. Laila can only fight one enemy at a time, and enemies attack less frequently, which drastically lowers the difficulty level. Guns now have infinite ammunition. However, some of the enemies have developed resistances to certain weapons, so switching weapons during the battles has become a necessity.</p>\n<p>Graphically, the two versions are rather similar; the PC-88 version has more detailed graphics and animation, but no backgrounds for the battles.</p>",

However, a series of events changes his life forever, as he is entrusted with the task of saving humans by discovering the ancient continent of Atlantis.</p>\n<p><em>1000-nen \u014ckoku</em> is an adventure game viewed from first-person perspective.

Each map features different terrain, enemy types, and overall difficulty level. The player has the option to scout the map in a safe mode before the actual battle. It is also necessary to equip the protagonist with various kinds of firearms. Precise characteristics of each weapons are displayed, so that the player is able to outfit the hero fittingly for the upcoming operation.</p>\n<p>The combat itself is tactical, having a nearly turn-based element: all the action is paused whenever the protagonist stops moving. Enemy units consist of soldiers equipped with various types of firearms, tanks, and (in some maps) planes and combat helicopters. Enemy soldiers would position themselves behind cover or in fortified locations, sit in trenches, try to surround the hero, etc. Both the protagonist and the enemies can swim, with the speed visibly decreased.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The inhabitants of the planet Rhea are being terrorized by a mysterious organization known as Hell Stones. To save his people, the king of Rhea himself steps out of his palace in order to single-handedly avert the threat.</p>\n<p><em>The Scheme</em> is an action game with role-playing and light platforming elements. The player controls the king as he explores vast outdoor and indoor environments. While some locations are simple side-scrolling areas, others are built like large mazes with platforming segments - the king has to jump on platforms to access certain areas or avoid enemy attacks; however, he doesn't take falling damage. Enemies respawn after the protagonist leaves the screen and returns. The king shoots energy orbs at the enemies; their type can be changed and upgraded as the game advances.</p>\n<p>The role-playing element is present in levels and character development. Enemies leave two kinds of power-ups upon defeat: life-restoring and force-increasing, the latter being roughly equivalent to experience points. Leveling up occurs after accumulating certain amounts of these power-ups, increasing the main character's hit points. It is often required to level up in order to be able to access areas with harder enemies or defeat bosses.</p>",

The couple hires Mike to search for the missing body; but as the detective begins to investigate the matter, he realizes that there is a much bigger conspiracy behind that.</p>\n<p><em>Burning Point</em> is a mystery-themed adventure game. The game does not have the usual set of simple verb commands with object lists, which is common for Japanese adventures. Instead, it offers specific options at each screen (though most of them repeat themselves as Mike goes about his investigation). The player has to interview suspects, unlock new locations (which, in their turn, deliver new suspects), as well as gather and examine evidence in order to advance the story and solve the case.</p>",

        "description": "<p>After having traveled to two magical realms, the hero was finally able to leave the world of Elderein and return to his own world, Luizard. However, upon his arrival he discovered that his travels have caused a time slip of several billion years. His world is now being threatened by the God of Darkness. He must use the Heart of Phantasm he found during his first adventure, and locate other heroes who would aid him on his quest and liberate the land.</p>\n<p><em>Mugen no Shinz\u014d III</em> is in many ways quite different from its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Ultima\">Ultima</a>-inspired <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/52929/mugen-no-shinzo-ii/\">predecessor</a>. Story progression is more linear, exploration more restricted; characters with their own backgrounds join the party, taking a cue from Japanese RPG design. However, the game doesn't have anime aesthetics characteristic of these games. Enemies are visibly roaming the overworld and dungeons; an encounter leads to a separate top-down battle screen, on which combat proceeds in real time, unless the player interferes and manually assigns commands to the characters.</p>",

Its story is set in the future and involves a man who was framed for a crime he did not commit.

Interaction with the environment and navigation are performed by selecting verb commands and combining them with objects from a menu list. There are no real puzzles, but it is possible to pick up objects, use them, and examine them in an inventory.</p>",

The player character has hit points and stamina statistics, can equip weapons and armor, find or win gold in battles and purchase items. The top-down overworld is comparatively small, but has to be navigated with care: there are various kinds of enemies and traps to be found there. Whenever something of interest occurs a very small separate window is displayed in the corner of the screen, showing for example the positioning of the enemies or the nature of the trap. </p>\n<p>The player interacts with the environment by pressing keys corresponding to commands; it is often necessary to outsmart enemies or even jump in certain instances.

It is necessary to aim and sometimes hit the enemy's weakpoint to succeed. There is a variety of weapons divided into two categories: beam (plasma, laser, etc.) and launcher (rocket, missile, etc.), assigned to respective keys during combat. Weapons and their ammunition can be acquired after successfully defeating enemies. The player character is also awarded experience points and grows stronger.</p>",

Five princesses of five countries constituting the realm, entrusted with the protection of the sacred light, were abducted. The hero, chosen by the magicians as the carrier of the legendary Still Sword, must venture into each country, now overrun by vicious monsters, rescue the princesses and defeat the fiends.</p>\n<p><em>Still Sword</em> is an overhead action dungeon crawler. The player character explores maze-like environments populated by wandering enemies. Defeating them yields experience points, gold, as well as random items such as weapons, equipment, or healing potions.

They sent a scout to the neighboring Beta Galaxy, with whom they had signed a peace treaty before. However, Beta authorities treated the scout with suspicion, fearing that Quasar Empire would break the treaty and assault them to further their goals. On the way back the scout was killed. A member of a special team known as the Anti-Intruder Rangers is sent to space with a clear objective: find the scout's remains and retrieve the vital information he carried.</p>\n<p><em>AIR</em> is primarily an action game with exploration and light role-playing elements. The player controls a tank-like space vehicle, moving from first-person perspective on planet surfaces. Several planets can be accessed and explored in any order. Contact with an enemy takes the player to a separate overhead screen where the battle takes place. The player must navigate the tank, shooting at the enemy and avoiding its attacks. Money is awarded, which can be spent to purchase more torpedoes and missiles, as well as repair the tank and buy new shields and batteries for it.</p>",

The city was destroyed, and only a few humans survived. A team of fighters was assembled in an underground complex and sent to fight the monsters on the surface. One of these fighters was imbued with special psionic powers and was entrusted with a mission of utmost importance.</p>\n<p><em>Ashe</em> is a side-view shooter with some platforming elements. The player can explore several interconnected areas, though certain locations can only be accessed in a specific order, after having fulfilled other objectives or acquired the necessary items. The player character uses his psionic ability to shoot energy balls at enemies, which causes his ESP level to be gradually depleted. Certain areas require jumping or climbing on structures to bypass.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Ayumi had been an ordinary Japanese teenage girl - until one day, when summer vacation was just about to begin, a strange creature appeared and told her that a parallel world is in danger. Only Ayumi can stop the evil warlock Baram and his monster minions, since the inhabitants of the other world consider her a goddess incarnate.</p>\n<p><em>Ayumi</em> is an adventure game with comical and slight erotic undertones. Interaction with the environment is performed by selecting commands (such as Examine, Ask, Take etc.) from a menu. However, unlike most Japanese adventures, navigation is done in a RPG-like fashion on a top-down world map, with individual locations represented as icons. The game allows a considerable degree of exploration, though some areas are inaccessible until certain conditions are met. As opposed to most Japanese adventures, the story progresses by solving problems (which usually involves procuring items and using them in another context) rather then simply by triggering events. There are also a few puzzles in the game.</p>",

The player can choose any of the two scenarios from the main menu.</p>\n<p>The gameplay consists of large-scale tactical battles composed of several interconnected areas each. Movement is entirely turn-based, and attacks can be executed when hostile characters are on adjacent fields. There are no separate battle screens or combat animation. Each bandit has their own attributes and can equip various weapons and armor, but there are no levels and the characters remain constant in strength.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Galactic Wars</em> is a space-themed real-time strategy game. It takes place in the year 2432 somewhere in the Milky Way galaxy and depicts a battle between the Galactic Alliance and an alien fleet, revolving around the strategically important planet M23. The game puts the player in control of a starfleet commander who has two spacecraft at his disposal: the Falcon and the Unicon. The entire game is controlled with menu commands. The player can change the course as well as offensive and defensive manoeuvres of the spaceships, and deploy fighters on the planet itself. The game proceeds in real time: if the player fails to choose a menu command within a short period of time his turn will be over and the enemies will execute their own manoeuvres.</p>",

Armed with simple twin-shot cannons, you move your ship vertically and side-to-side while enemies approach from up ahead to ram you. Only one enemy sprite can appear at a time, so the next attacker will only appear once the current ship has been successfully dodged or shot. Three types of enemy ships attack in a never-ending loop, and the game's only goal is to attain a high score by shooting down as many as possible before losing all three of your lives.</p>",

It is up to the lord Aros di Gran to save the land, by collecting four \"Fire Crystals\" and challenging Gaudius for control over the more powerful crystal.</p>\n<p>Action takes place from a side view, action platforming perspective. Your character's primary means of attack are projectiles, with some additional items to be picked up over the course of your adventure serving to expand your character's arsenal. Flip-screen transitions cause enemies to respawn immediately upon exiting / re-entering certain screens, making some of the vertical platforming particularly challenging. While the game does boast above-average sprite work for the platform, the stilted animation and movements can often render the game difficult to visually parse.</p>",

Due to the player's role (Or, perhaps, poor AI), most drivers on the road seem to deliberately try to crash into the player's car making players rely on the brakes once they get too close. Players need to reach the end of the level within a certain period of time while avoiding the drivers on their path. Reaching checkpoints will give players extra time to complete the level. On the road to Technopolis, players will see an 8-bit rendition of buildings, amusement parks, Mt. Fuji, the Golden Gate Bridge and other sights to behold. Can the spy get to Technopolis safely?</p>",

However, just before the signing of the treaty, members of the military-industrial complex, who were opposed to the treaty, carried out a coup d'etat to prevent this. Colonel Iritsa Renina, commander of the Beta Unit of the Galactic Federation, refused to help the coup and ordered the rebellion to be suppressed. The object of the game is that you, the Beta Unit ace pilot, Ensign Rova Trotskyna must destroy the federal facility that was occupied in the coup.</p>\n<p><em>Final Crisis: Terrestrial Defense Police</em> is a side-scrolling shoot'em up. You start with a standard firepower, but by shooting certain enemies it may leave items that can give you different weapons like the standard shot, homing shots or the laser. Throughout the game you have the option to choose which one you want to use as main weapon.</p>\n<p>The Letter A increases your rate of fire and then you can hold down the button to use the turbo fire. The P of power-up gives you two pods on the sides that fire simultaneously. Sometimes there are items that give back some energy. There are also rare items that will give you full health or an extra life.</p>\n<p>You start with three lives and once they are lost it's game over but you can choose if you want to use a continue to get back where you last died.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Moritan no Battle Field</em> is a two-player turn-based strategy game set on a fixed 41x41 square game map. There are four types of military units: infantry, tank, fighter plane and bomber, each of which have different combat effectiveness against the other unit types. The map is symmetrical, and divided into 16 territories, 14 of which are neutral at the start of the game. The aim of each player is to take over areas to provide resources for buying more military units, and to eventually force the capture of the opponent's home base. </p>\n<p>At any point in the game, you have five options (selected using the function keys F1-F5). You may move a unit, attack, supply or purchase a unit, or end your turn. Units may be selected using the arrow keys, and are moved one square at a time vertically, horizontally or diagonally on the grid. The different units have different movement capability over the different terrain types. Tanks can only be used in open areas. Infantry move less quickly, but can enter forest squares and are the only unit that can be used to take over cities if they end their turn on that square. Fighters and bombers can fly above all terrain, but need to be regularly re-supplied to prevent them from falling out of the sky.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Valna</em> is an RPG that incorporates traditional JRPG (turn-based) and action-RPG elements.</p>\n<p>The game takes place in Uniterion, on the night of the 100th anniversary of the Kingdom. The Chief Priest Zaurzarius kills the king and also all of his servants. However, the young Princess Melfia is rescued by the hands of Guard Captain Riatos. From then on, the world is desolate and turned into a monster's nest. The brave Deal Garat sets out on a journey in search of the legendary crystal to resolve this. Many years later, Deal's son Kamil visits the Kingdom of Uniterion in search of his father's whereabouts. This is where the game starts, with the player playing as Kamil.</p>\n<p>In towns there is a side view and the battles are turn-based, like in traditional JRPGs. Here the player can also rest at inns, buy weapons and armor and talk to some people. Outside of towns, in the overworld and in dungeons, the view is overhead and the battles are in real-time action. The player also gets ranged spells which they can fire. Killed enemies may sometimes leave gold or HP gems behind, the latter will refill HP - sometimes even to the max.</p>\n<p><em>Valna</em> also incorporates System Sacom's Novel Wware system.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Minky-Momo Panicball</em> is an action game featuring the main character from the anime TV series <em>Magical Princess Minky Momo</em>. Balls drop from the sky, and then bounce around the screen. You control the princess, who can move left, right or jump. She can either catch the ball in a basket she is carrying in front of her, or continue to let it bounce and wait for another to fall. Catching a ball gives you points. But after it has bounced around for a while and there are more on the screen you will get more points per ball. Being hit by a ball will knock you out, and lose one of your three lives. Extra lives are earned by completing a level, which consists of a fixed number of balls. Later levels are distinguished only by different colours, increased frequency of ball drops, and requiring a greater number of balls caught for completion.</p>",

You play as Ban, who travels the perilous labyrinths in search of gems, while being pursued by monsters of various types. The maze contains obstacles such as piles of skulls, which much not be touched, and some force-fields that prevent monsters from passing, but do not affect Ban. There are many items in the maze. Rings, orbs and potions can be retrieved for bonus points. A fist icon will temporarily give Ban the ability to destroy the monsters. But the main objective is to collect all of the gems, which completes the level and takes you to the next.</p>",

Robots appear one at a time in a large rectangular arena. They are stationary when they appear, but can randomly and suddenly teleport to other parts of the screen. You control a cross-hair, that you can use to target and shoot the robot, which is only vulnerable in the chest area. If you shoot a certain number of robots within 3 minutes, Seiko will demonstrate her appreciation by showing herself, sans an item of clothing. Failure to destroy all of the robots by the time limit will end the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Horror House</em> is Falcom's first graphical text adventure and the first installment in the Falcom Occultic Mystery Adventure series in which Mr. F sends you a request. In the house they were planning to move into a ghost suddenly appeared. They asked you to investigate. The object of the game is to enter the mansion where psychic phenomena occur and find out its secrets, as per the request.</p>\n<p>The commands to be given is expressed in Japanese in katakana: \"noun\" + \"space\" + \"verb\". For example, to pick up a lighter that fell on the floor, type \"TAKE LIGHTER\" (\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc \u30c8\u30eb). To navigate through the locations type \"GO LEFT\" (\u30d2\u30c0\u30ea\u3000\u30e6\u30af), \"GO RIGHT\" (\u30df\u30ae\u3000\u30e6\u30af), \"MOVE FORWARD\" (\u30de\u30a8\u3000\u30b9\u30b9\u30e0), \"MOVE BACKWARDS\" (\u30a6\u30b7\u30ed\u3000\u30b9\u30b9\u30e0) or \"GO UP\" (\u30a6\u30a8\u3000\u30e6\u30af). Enter \"noun + \u30df\u30eb\" if you want to look at something. Repeating an incorrect command that is not supported or cannot be given several times in the current situation will cause a ghost to appear and if you don't run away quickly it will be game over, so be careful.</p>",
