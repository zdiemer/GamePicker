The game essentially has one puzzle, but one that - as the authors believe - is practically impossible to solve despite making perfect logical sense. </p>\n<p>The player takes control of an adventurer who has already solved all the puzzles in the game, and now faces one last challenge, a \"Three Troll\" guarding a bridge. In the player's inventory is a \"qualitative calculator\", and the player also knows that \"something is ticking\" in the vicinity. The goal is to get past the troll.</p>",
