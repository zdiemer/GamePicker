        "description": "<p>An early <em>Chess</em> game was developed on the MANIAC I computer in Los Alamos. Unlike <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/89186/robot-chess/\">earlier attempts</a> at chess games this game did allow players to run a full game of chess, but it used a simplified board with only 6x6 squares. It implemented Claude Shannon's system for determining a move (as implemented in the <em>Electric Chess Automaton</em> in 1949). The game calculated all possible moves over two levels of the decision tree and then used static factors and minimaxing to determine the best move. The computer could do roughly 11,000 operations per second and calculating a turn took 12 minutes. It is known to have played three games. It's reported to have roughly equal skill to a player with twenty matches of experience.</p>",

The game uses a two dimensional scale model of the solar system and the player is free to fly around. Physics are simplified as the player is only affected by the single strongest pull at a given time. There are no explicit objectives in the game, but the player can navigate around the solar system and attempt landings on planets and moons. The space craft can be moved and turned and the simulation speed can be increased to quickly reach destinations. </p>\n<p>In order to port the game to the PDP-7 the developer created his own operation system which would later evolve to become Unix.</p>",

Each player has six round pits and a Kalah, which is a longer pit. When starting out three stones are evenly distributed to the round pits. The aim of the game is to collect more than half of the stones in the player's Kalah.</p>\n<p>In each round the player takes all stones from one pit and distributes them anti clockwise around the board with one in each pit. If the last stone lands in the players' own Kalah, they must make one more move. If the last stone ends in a pit on the player's side and the pit on the other side is empty, all stones in that pit will be captured. The game stops if no more moves can be made by the players and the opponents then get to count their remaining stones to their total or when one player has more than half of the stones.</p>\n<p>While the game can be played with two players, either or both can also be substituted by the computer. When a player is on turn the space bar can be pressed to let the computer make the move. The state of the game is displayed on a CRT or printed on a teletype printer. When the game finishes the computer declares which player won and what the final score was.</p>",

The game allows the user to simulate a game of baseball on the computer. The player's input is limited to picking a random number between 1 and 1000 after which the game is played out. The two teams (Dodgers and Yankees) will bat it out. Based purely on chance the baseball players will hit singles, doubles or home runs, steal a base, be safe or out.

        "description": "<p><em>Theaterspiel</em> is a military training simulation game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/89537/hutspiel/\">Hutspiel</a>. The primary difference is that it models an entire theater of war. It was used by the United States for studying Army problems with a focus on ground combat operations, but it also includes air operations, air defense and logistics. All the bookkeeping and most of the assessment procedures are handled by the computer. The player takes the role of the theater commander and must make all the decisions. Combat results are generally resolved on division level. Input for the game is handled with punch cards and the results are printed using a line printer. Each player is supplied with a status of all forces at the start of the game and a map and intelligence which differs between the two teams.</p>\n<p>In each turn a team generates orders (movement, posture, designation, etc.) for its units. A third \"control\" team has to inspect the validity and feasibility of the orders and compares the orders with the other team's orders and determines the outcome of the combined orders. The computer then further processes that data and updates and prints the battlefield status. The game ends after a predetermined number of days or a specific event such as being overrun.</p>",

The rarity of items is also random making a certain type of item rare in one game but common in another. Aside from weapons the player will find many other items which can be used to interact with the environment. Instead of \"magic items\" the game has strange devices. To find out what a strange device does the player must identify it at a library or find out through trial and error.</p>\n<p>Initially the Mainframe game featured only a single mission, this was later expanded to three.</p>",

However, there are many useful items in the battlestar that you may need before you escape, but only so many turns before it explodes.</p>\n<p>Battlestar is interesting among text adventures in that it tracks the current player orientation and updates the directions based on the current facing. For example,  entering the room on the 'right', would result in a direction of 'behind' for leaving the room again. Re-entering the room would then be 'behind' when back in the corridor. Absolute directions (N,S,E,W) are possible, but only when a compass is found.</p>\n<p>Battlestar was originally written for the PDP-11/70.

Landing on a position with only piece will send it back to the beginning.</p>\n<p>All moves in this version of the game are entered as a sequence of piece positions to move, in the same order as the dice role is listed.

        "description": "<p>Canfield is a terminal implementation of Canfield solitaire. Per the original, cards are organized into four locations. In this version, they are labelled as foundation, tableau, stock and talon. The objective is to move all cards into the foundation. Cards in the foundation start at a given rank (e.g. 7) and that must match the first card placed in each position. Cards must then match suite and increase by rank (e.g. 8 on top of 7), wrapping around if needed.</p>\n<p>The tableau is the work area, where cards can be stacked and shifted as needed to expose cards for play. Here, cards decrease in rank, using alternating colours (e.g. red 9 on black 10). The stock is a stack of cards, of which only the top card can be played at any given time. The remaining cards in the stock are inaccessible until exposed. Finally, the talon is the currently active card, and can be cycled through based on the hand in play. Like other solitaire games, the talon is cycled three cards at a time, though only one is visible in this version of the game.</p>\n<p>This game can also follow casino betting rules, which charges for hands cycled, initial inspection and a few other things, while crediting cards placed. This information can be ignored if just playing the game for fun, however.</p>",

The last player capable of playing is able to \u2018go\u2019, and the sequence repeats until all cards are played.</p>\n<p>The following items are worth points during play:\nReaching a value of 31 points: 2 points\nA \u2018GO\u2019 when the opponent is unable to play: 1 point\nA total value of 15: 2 points\nA sequence of three cards: 2 points\nA pair of cards: 2 points\nFlush (e.g. all cards in hand of same suit): 2 points\nJack of the same suite as the starter: 1 point</p>\n<p>This version of cribbage, although it performs automatic counting during play, requires the player to manually compute the value of their hand after play. Errors in score entry are reported by the computer accordingly. If using the -e command-line argument, a more detailed explanation of the score error is provided.</p>",

It is also possible to operate a scanner to locate enemies, or enable a cloak which will obscure you from scanners. All of the above take charges from a universal ammo pool.

Other cards consist of hazards/conditions (e.g. flat tire), counters to the hazards (e.g. spare tire), and rare protections against hazards (e.g. puncture proof).

Players may then explore, fight monsters, fight each other, gain experience and collect treasure throughout the land. </p>\n<p>There are several general goals in the game. Collecting a crown between levels 10 and 1000 allows a player to be crowned King, and lord over or collect taxes from other players. Players reaching level 3000 become members of the Council of the Wise and may then teleport, cause interventions on other players, and search for the Holy Grail.

        "description": "<p>Sail is a multiplayer terminal naval combat game, initially based on the Fighting Sail board game. The objective is to destroy or capture all enemy ships among a variety of scenarios. Scenarios are divided between historic naval battles (e.g. \u2018The Battle of Lake Erie\u2019), fictional battles (\u2018Hornblower and the battle of Rosas bay\u2019), and some slightly absurd ones (\u2018Curse of the Flying Dutchman\u2019 and \u2018Star Trek\u2019).</p>\n<p>The game plays in a pseudo turn-based fashion: commands are entered for a turn, then synchronized among all other players. Commands are entered as a sequence of numbers and letters. For example, \u20183r\u2019 would result in moving forward three spaces, then turning right once. The turn will automatically time out and advance after a short delay, so there is not much time for strategizing. The game attempts to account for the effects of wind, ship orientation when receiving a broadside, damage and repairs, and differences in ship/crew capabilities. Like any good naval combat game, it also allows boarding parties.</p>",

One player controls the Moties, an advanced race that will enslave humankind when they come into contact with them. The game board consists of interconnected interstellar jump points. The Moties have a ship which they can move one spot each turn; the humans have 3 ships they can move. The goal for the humans is to lock the Moties in so that they cannot make a valid move. The Moties win if they reach the human home world, aren't captured by turn 15 or if moves repeat for more than 3 times in a row.</p>",

It was adapted heavily from the original to increase the challenge of the game.</p>\n<p>Instead of moving the starship and firing torpedoes in directions of 45 degrees <em>Ultimate Star Trek</em> allows a direction in degrees. Additionally the Enterprise now has a cloaking device which makes it possible to sneak up to enemies. Probes can scan distant points of the galaxy without actually being close. To counteract this empowerment of the player more enemies are added, including the Romulans, Thallians, Eminians and Hortae. Each race has different statistics: The Romulans take simply more hits than Klingons to kill. Thalians make the enterprise immobile. Eminians have an anti-matter field which disables warp drives, phasers and photon torpedoes. The Hortae have a sonic disruptor beam which does extreme damage, but they are not naturally hostile to the player. The Thalians, Eminians and Hortae all don't show up on long distance scans.</p>\n<p>When firing at a star with a torpedo the star will go into super nova and swallow up the entire quadrant.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Yahtzee</em> is an implementation of the classic dice game. The game allows play for up to fifteen players. All the usual rules apply. On a turn a player rolls five dice and can re-roll (a selection) twice. Scoring is divided in multiples of a value (amount of aces, twos, threes, etc.) and special rolls such as full house and Yahtzee (5 identical dice). After each turn the player must decide what to write, or strike out one of the available options if nothing matches. Getting at least 63 points with multiples will yield a bonus score of 35 points. Whoever scores the most points at the end wins.</p>",

When all balls are thrown the team whose ball is closest to the jack scores points. Ball can also hit each other and knock each other away. When this happens a bell is rung.

        "description": "<p><em>The Sumerian Game</em> is an early computer game played by teletype and video projector. While mostly forgotten by history it did inspire the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Hamurabi\">Hamurabi</a> which became hugely popular in the late 60s and early 70s. The game is designed for fourth grade students.</p>\n<p>In the game the player rules as three successive rulers of the Sumerian city-state of Lagash. During the reign of each ruler the player must make decisions, mostly of an economic nature to sustain the population. Visuals such as graphs and charts help the players understand the economic concepts. The video projector would show slide shows which were combined with tape audio. The tape audio would contain simulated discussion of the king's cabinet and news bulletins, which served as intermezzos to the economic reports which were all in printed format. All player actions were typed in on the teletype. A court adviser gives advice on actions and makes sure actions are executed.</p>\n<p>The script of the game was revised multiple times until funding ran out in 1967.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>FRON v4.0</em> is a multi-player space game built on the IBM System 360 mainframe at UCLA. The user interface was developed by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/1236456/frank-wood/\">Frank Wood</a>, and the internal logic was coded by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/81485/don-worth/\">Don Worth</a>.</p>\n<p>Gameplay involves exploration of a randomly generated map of stars. As a player-vs-player game, players take turns plotting moves on their part of the map. Map visibility is limited to the area currently occupied by the player and adjacent squares; enemy ship movement in other areas is unknown, while still being tracked by the computer. Because it is played over dial-up on the ARPANET, there is an overnight delay between moves. The game map is printed out via Teletype.</p>\n<p>According to the game's creator, Don Worth, FRON was backed up on a 9-track mainframe tape, which is no longer extant.</p>",

Two cards must be laid into the crib. During a round cards are played and their total added up. The value of the added value cannot exceed 31 or the other player scores a point. If a player manages to get to exactly 31 two points are scored. Additional points can be scored for getting exactly 15, playing a pair, a triplet, double pair or run. After all cards are played players score additional points for all combinations that can be made with their hand, including a card cut at the start.

The player is placed within a field 10x20 tiles big. The player can move horizontally, vertically and diagonally. A number of enemy interceptors (between 15 and 35) are also placed on the field. These interceptors will do the exact same move as the player (space permitting). The goal is to guide them all to collision with high voltage poles which destroys them. Up to half a dozen attackers are also present on the field. They have a random personality which determines the rules with which they can attack. The attackers cannot move.

Each turn the Native Americans will move closer and kill some of the player's men. If the player manages to survive until the cavalry arrives the game is won.</p>",

At the start of the game the player can place a single base of operations, five missile sites and four mines. The player can use armies to try to conquer enemy territory or defend their base. The game is over if one of the players loses their base. Mines can be placed to defend the base as they will destroy the first army that steps on them. The base empowers nearby armies, making it more important to not hide the base too far away from the front lines. Missiles can be used to fire on anything within range. The player cannot see what goes on in enemy territory, but has full vision over their own half of the US.</p>",

The computer has positioned their fleet on a grid. The player fires at their opponent's grid in an attempt to destroy their fleet. The players can't see the ships, but did receive a map containing the positions of enemy ships. However only a single position of each ship is shown, regardless of their grid size and the map can be either mirrored or rotated allowing for additional deductive work to be done. The player has 25 rounds of ammunition to destroy the enemy fleet with.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Air Defense Simulation</em> is most likely the first game ever made to be (partially) run on a computer. The game possibly ran on a UNIVAC computer at some point and allowed the simulation of air defense in North America. This would allow the US Army to play out scenarios and find the best strategy to employ. The program was intended to speed up existing simulation games that were played out without the use of computers. Many elements of the game were still played on paper, but most of the calculations were done by a computer to speed everything up. Modeled elements of war present in this game are enemy aircraft, anti-aircraft guns and naval guided missiles in a three dimensional grid.</p>",

The computer arbitrates the game since neither player is now aware whether a move they make is actually valid. If a player tries to make a move that isn't valid (for example because it would put them in a 'check' position) both players are informed that an invalid move was attempted. When a piece is taken the capturing player is not told what type of piece it was. Players can ask the game if any of their pawns are in a position that they can capture another piece.
