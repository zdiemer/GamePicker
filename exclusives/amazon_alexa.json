        "description": "<p>This <em>Very Special Edition</em> of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/53545/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/\">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a> is a free voice-controlled game for Amazon Alexa which isn't a full port of the original game but a rather simplified version that lets the player become Dragonborn in this narrated story. The places in Skyrim, creatures, monsters, actions, they are all there but with limitations on how you can interact with them and in what capacity.</p>\n<p>The player initially starts with a level 1 character. While traveling Skyrim many characters will ask for the player's help. Whether their possessions have been stolen by the bandits, or some dangerous monster burnt down their village and whatnot. The player can accept each of the quests, or simply refuse and keep going. By accepting the quest, the story will lead you to retrieve some item and face the next villain. The story will constantly let you choose your path by asking you which path you wish to take, more dangerous but quicker one, or safer but a longer one. The player's journey will stop the moment an opponent (a bandit, a monster, enemy soldier, a dragon, etc.) blocks the way ahead. At that moment, the battle commences. There are three types of attack; using a weapon (sword, mace, or any other equipped weapon), shouting the dragon tongue, or casting a spell. There is no weapon, shout or spell selection, instead, the player character uses what he has equipped or what best serves the purpose at hand. At the end of each quest, there will be a boss battle.</p>\n<p>Certain types of enemies are resistant to certain types of attack and if attacked that way their counter-attack will be swift and deadly. The player can ask for their current health status, though at the end of each quest their health fully replenishes. There are no health potions to use or any other way to heal the player character during the quest. Weapon skill, shout skill, and spell casting skill all start at level 1, and the more a certain type of attack is used successfully, the player will level up in those areas and be able to deal with enemies more easily. Alexa will immediately prompt the player whenever the player levels up some of the skills available.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Yes Sire</em> is a strategic simulation set in medieval times and custom-made for smart speakers. You play the role of a king making yes or no decisions that are presented to you by a court assistant and confidante. The goal is to maintain balance in the kingdom by maintaining your wealth and influence meters between 0 and 100. Each question that is presented, regarding various military, economic, and personal matters, can reduce or increase these two stats. If your influence or wealth becomes too high or too low, the emperor will have you exiled or executed.</p>\n<p>The game is reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/80569/reigns/\">Reigns</a>. Players have the option of buying a <em>Wicked Witch</em> expansion pack through an in-app purchase on their echo device. Players that can last 40 turns will be awarded a second expansion pack, the <em>Admiral DiCosta</em> expansion pack. Each expansion pack adds an additional 40-50 questions to the base game. The only two words players need to use are \"yes\" or \"no\".</p>",

        "description": "<p>Hey Robot is a hybrid game, played with smart speakers (Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant) and a deck of physical cards. The cards each have a single word or a celebrity name on their front, and a point value 1-3 on the back, with the number corresponding to the difficulty of the card (3 being hardest). Two individuals or two teams take turns and compete to see who can score 16 points first. The deck of cards is shuffled and 16 cards are laid out in a 4x4 grid, face down. A player or team scores a point by picking a card, turning it over to reveal the target word, and asking their smart speaker a question that cannot have the word or part of the word in it. If the smart speaker response contains the target word, the player scores the point value of the card. For instance with the word Tea, a 1 point easy word, one might ask, \"What was the protest against taxation held in Boston Harbor that helped launch the Revolutionary War\", and if the smart speaker responds with an answer that includes \"Boston Tea Party\" that player scores 1 point. A slightly simplified version of the game has been played repeatedly on The Tonight Show, with the host Jimmy Fallon challenging famous comedians like Tina Fey, John Mulaney, Ricky Gervais, Steve Martin and Martin Short, among others.</p>",
