        "description": "<p><em>Conquest of Chesterwoode</em> is a turn-based wargame from Adventure International for 2-4 players. Your ancestors journeyed into the dark Forest of Chesterwoode, facing dreadful basilisks, worgs, a wurm, and more. Eventually civilization was established, and the land divided into 63 provinces, in a convenient hex-shaped grid. Then crops failed, there were food riots, and robbers appeared. Tyrants built fortresses to protect themselves from one another.</p>\n<p>Now centuries later, as the descendants of those ancients, you want to unite the provinces. To do so however, you must fight, until only one leader remains. Only then will the serfs be freed from their servitude and peace and prosperity come again.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is similar to typical board wargames with hex squares, but being on the computer, the rules can be far more complex and realistic than in a board game. At least 2 human players are required.</p>",

Shoot as many \"spy saucers\" out of the sky as you can, in a limited time and as accurately as possible. At the bottom center of the screen is the cannon, which you can angle in five different positions. Some saucers are worth more than others, and on rare occasions you get a shot at one which will destroy all the others if you hit it. Go light on the trigger: missiles are expensive, which means you lose points for misses, not to mention saucers which get away.</p>",

In their bid to conquer the galaxy, the Jovians are attacking United Planet System bases; when no base remains, your mission ends in failure.</p>\n<p>Scanners will help you find the Jovians and the bases, hyperdrive will get you there, and Masers and Triton Missiles will blast the Jovian ships into the ether. It's best to go in with deflectors up, because the game is real-time and the Jovians will start firing before you do. A full damage report is available, with the fastest repairs done at one of the bases. Combat is especially challenging because you must issue numeric commands, including direction and firepower, while listening to the Jovians blast away at you (sound effects driving home the urgency of your situation). Even outside of combat, the Jovian ships will move from quadrant to quadrant, and you may have to fight through magnetic storms or even around invisible black holes.</p>\n<p>The action is shown via a map of your quadrant, including stars, ships and bases. The general status is directly below that, while scanning and damage reports are shown separately. Ten levels of play vary the number of enemy ships and the bases in jeopardy, to the point of making victory far from inevitable on the higher levels.</p>",

        "description": "<p>As the Great Venicksia, legendary conjuror and Ghost Exterminator Extraordinaire, you may have finally met your match. This town is crawling with ghosts! Stepping off the train at the depot, your objective is walk to the haunted house and back, blasting as many ghosts as you can along the way. Your weapon is your own design, a \"Ghost Blaster,\" capable of steady fire, though short, controlled bursts are the better option. The ghosts, of course, want you to panic. They're here to scare you to death, and to that end, each one that escapes will awaken the next, more dangerous ghost. When the thirteenth ghost appears, it's curtains for you.</p>\n<p>This early first-person shooter presents you with a panoply of ghosts in classical forms drifting and darting across the detailed backdrop of a Western ghost town. As you shoot ghosts, you advance across the backdrop: bigger steps for more dangerous ghosts. Your passage is made more complicated by a laughing ghost whose head pops up briefly and must also be shot to prevent the ghost counter from ticking forward. Some help is provided by spiders, of whom the ghosts are afraid; shoot a spider and the ghost counter goes down, though then ghosts swarm back <em>en masse</em>. Your Ghost Blaster is represented by a movable sight on the screen, but it takes more than just a quick trigger finger to hit a ghost. You must lead your targets. This is the only sense of depth the game screen gives, except when that final ghost comes rushing out to get you.</p>\n<p>Each pass through town is rewarded with a musical refrain, which changes from level to level. A successful round trip moves you up one level, which changes the background slightly and treats you to clever names like \"Dead of Night\" and \"Good Mourning.\" There are bonus trips to be discovered and even a secret behind the appearance of spiders and the mysterious laughing head. If you beat all thirty-two levels, you are truly a Ghost Exterminator Extraordinaire.</p>",

Much to your dismay, you discover that the aliens did not entirely self-destruct and that they are belligerent. Your escape is closed off; the only way to escape and warn Earth is to destroy the alien ships, find the hidden translocator, and zap to\u2026 another alien warbase.</p>\n<p>Each maze-like warbase is protected by squads of three or four different alien ships with different capabilities. The Fighters just shoot at you, where the Annihilators, for instance, drop a ticking mine canister which wipes out the entire warbase. The translocator doesn't appear until you've destroyed the guards, and if you take too long with that, the Vexers arrive, making a beeline for your ship, walls notwithstanding.</p>\n<p>You are far from helpless, however. Your ship can shoot in four directions and comes equipped with hyperdrive units, which are partially replenished by each translocator you nab. Hyperdrive zaps you to a random location in the warbase, a big help when Chasers are zeroing in on you. You can generate an antimatter field, too; that destroys all the walls, another life-saver when you're racing to the translocator with Vexers hot on your tail.</p>\n<p>As you might expect, bonus ships are granted at point thresholds, and the warbases go on and on.</p>",

Both adventures also use an early form of interactive fiction with a graphics style interface.  Each game also incorporates a real-time clock element of 30 minutes.</p>\n<p>In Toxic Dumpsite a major problem has occurred at the nuclear waste disposal plant.  You are trapped inside and must figure out how to prevent a nuclear disaster before containment systems fail.  You have 30 minutes to complete the task and the clock is ticking.</p>\n<p>The second adventure in this double feature is Spook House which you have been abducted and locked inside an abandoned carnival spook house.  A bomb has been set for 30 minutes and you must figure out how to defuse the device and escape to freedom.</p>\n<p>This graphical interactive fiction game uses a mixture of letter directions N,S,E,W and F,B,L,R (forward, back, left, right) for movement.  You can also SAVEGAME your current location for restarting later.  The command parser is a somewhat modified verb noun type.</p>",

Your task is to compose music and choreograph dance routines for him. Then sit back, watch the curtain rise at the next gig (Belvedere Theater, Oskowatcha, Washington), and enjoy the show.</p>\n<p>This musical game translates two octaves of notes with sharps and flats to the computer keyboard, playing them as you compose. Rests are possible, but no half-notes or quarter-notes. For the dance routine, you can choose from eighteen different moves, varying in length and complexity from steps to spins, squats, and stomps. For inspiration, two routines are included, but you can save your own to create a vast repertoire for the demon. Each show raises the curtain on a hulking figure who dominates the stage, but adeptly -- indeed, enthusiastically -- matches every step you program, to the tune you composed.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In a sister game to Voyage of the Valkyrie, developer <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/392429/leo-b-christopherson/\">Leo B. Christopherson</a> puts you back in the role of a buck private in the renowned Space Vikings. Norse folklore is again prominent, the plot borrowed from the Peer Gynt story. You must rescue the princess Anitra, held for ransom by the rogue Mountain Troll King, and as a parting gesture leave a bomb to destroy the entire Troldhjem Kingdom.</p>\n<p>The catch is that Anitra won't come with you unless you charm her with jewelry, so you'll need to find some along the way. Also, keep an eye out for the scattered pieces of the bomb; all seven are necessary. These are hidden in the Norwegian Circle Maze you'll have to navigate to find the Hall of the Mountain King. Given that it comprises forty-one circles, each intersecting up to six others, you'll probably see most of it a few times over before arriving at your destination. Mapping your route is important, because while the actual rescue just requires reaching the hall, escaping means finding your way out before that bomb goes off.</p>\n<p>As you might expect, there are also trolls in the Troll Kingdom: big ones with guns. Fortunately your little rail car which rides the tracks of the circle maze not only has a defense shield, but is quick enough to back out of any battle which gets a little too hot. Combat is a first-person view of the troll -- looking rather like Christopherson's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/46290/dancing-demon/\">Dancing Demon</a> -- jumping back and forth and blasting at you, while you maneuver crosshairs to shoot him in the heart. This alternates with a status screen showing your address within the maze, rank, treasure and items collected, and body count. Bring back enough treasure and you could retire as the Prince Regent.</p>\n<p>As the title implies, Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt Suite provides brief musical interludes. Five levels of difficulty and seven variations on the fixed maze scale the challenge, which is single-player only. A sealed map is included in the booklet for those who become understandably desperate, and there's also a cheat key to start you at the climax scene.</p>",

Worst of all, they're in a terrible hurry and often jump two at a time from any of five floors, with little forewarning. In this arcade game you maneuver a large basket to catch them just before they hit the ground (with an audible splat, but no gore -- these are Model I/III graphics). The jumpers have a fair horizontal reach, too, so you have to hustle back and forth, and lead them just a bit. If you get in over your head, you can bounce one back up in the air, so you have time to catch someone else in between.</p>\n<p>Misses rack up with gruesome speed in the sidebar of the single graphical screen, and five wraps it up, giving you time at last to examine your score. You'll probably want to keep your day job.</p>",

Your mission is to bomb all the Land Rovers into oblivion so you can get on to the presumably easier part of attacking a small town. Fortunately for the town, there is an endless line of Land Rovers defending against your three ships. You're never going to see that town.</p>\n<p>The Land Rovers are stationary and come five at a time, firing well-aimed missiles. You maneuver your ship over them -- up and down, slow and fast -- dropping just one bomb at a time. Your ship keeps cycling overhead until all five Rovers are gone; misses only use up fuel, which is limited, counts for points, and ticks downward more quickly with each round.</p>\n<p>There's no bonus ships, difficulty levels, armor, or power-ups: just four arrow keys and three strikes until you're out.

You must race across the island while dodging falling coconuts, which stream down from the top of the screen, exactly where you are trying to guide your 10-pixel avatar. If you're fast, you make it through, gain 100 points, and start again at the bottom. If you're unlucky, you meet a coconut at the very top, with no chance to dodge, or at the bottom just when you enter again in middle of the windstorm.</p>\n<p>Five knocks on the head and the classic \"Game Over\". The single-screen layout is typical arcade as well, showing your score and \"men\" on the right side, with the graphical playing field on the left. Speed, however, is what the game showcases with its machine-language code. Of the four game speeds available, the slowest is a walk in the park, still challenging because your avatar is in no hurry, either. The fastest speed, though, caters to suicidal mania as pixels barely light before they are blanked and each trip up the screen takes about one second, unless you meet a coconut.</p>",

        "description": "<p>\"Based on the essence of science,\" as the game box declaims -- if not quite the reality of science -- <em>Atom Splitting</em> is a top-down shooting gallery in which you split atoms with carefully aimed electrons. Your atom smasher at the top of the screen can slide back and forth, but only kicks out one electron at a time, while atoms float side-to-side below.</p>\n<p>Though atoms are replaced as they're split, they adopt an increasingly Brownian motion, changing speed and reversing direction. Direct hits become a matter not just of timing but good luck, and grazing hits don't even count. There aren't even high scores; this is nuclear physics, after all. Every game starts you off with 600 energy, while each electron shot uses 200 energy, and a split atom returns 300. You can ramp up your stored energy nicely at first, but as the increasingly Brownian motion begins to best your intuition, that energy drops to zero like quarters in an 80's arcade.</p>",

Unlike most arcade-style games of this era, <em>Exterminator</em> provides the player with nothing to move or aim. You must simply wait, fingers on seven keys -- one for each box -- estimating where the crawling bugs will meet a moving crack and fall through.</p>\n<p>Getting the box number right, however, is not enough. The trap doors are open only for a second, so your key-presses must be timed within each bug's drop to be successful. Meanwhile, the cracks are catching more bugs which are dropping toward your closed traps. Naturally, the speed of the conveyor and the number of cracks increases with time. Let twenty-five escape and it's \"Game Over,\" fifty points tallied for each one you successfully trapped.</p>\n<p>Simple sound effects lend creepiness to the exercise, which centers around remembering which of your fingers will activate which trap door as you focus on the screen. There's no time for hunt-and-peck; at last those piano lessons will pay off!</p>",

When starting out the player has four ships and four units of hyperspace energy. More ships and energy is given for each 10,000 points scored and an extra ship is also given at the start of each sector.

The screen is divided in two part by a force field. On the upper section mines move around until the player shoots them. Then an alien is launched from the mine which flies through the force field to the lower section where it attempts to crash into the player. The aliens are also able to drop bombs at the player. The player simply has to shoot them to prevent this from happening. Once all enemies have been cleared the force field is lowered and a new set of enemies arrives. There are four kinds of enemies and they move in different patterns and at different speed. The enemies of the fourth wave are special since they quickly move straight down towards the player. If they reach the bottom of the screen the player dies even if not directly hit. The player has three ships and an extra is awarded at 2000 points. The game can be played by one or two players.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Meteor Mission</em> is an arcade action game for two players. Unlike its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/67022/meteor-mission-2/\">sequel</a> it is not a variant of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Lunar+Rescue\">Lunar Rescue</a> although it has some minor similarities. The game takes place after a second big bang has occurred and the galaxy is full of stray meteors. Each player's job is to take control of a space ship and move it through the meteor belt to a space station and dock. The meteors move across the screen from left to right while the players' space ships are located at the bottom of the screen and the space stations at the top. The game is played with only two keys: up and down with no horizontal movement of the ship possible. If a player collides with a meteor, he or she gets to restart at the bottom. When reaching the space station one point is earned. A game goes on for three minutes and the player with the most points at the end will win. If the score is equal, the game will continue until one player has scored. Reaching a high score will lead to extra time. Before playing, a difficulty can be selected which affects the amount of meteors.</p>",

The player controls a shuttle that has to be used to rescue six stranded astronauts from a planet. The game is viewed from the side with the player starting out from a space station at the top and the astronauts that have to be reached on the surface. To rescue them the player has to navigate through a field of asteroids and meteors and land on one of three platforms. The shuttle can be moved left and right and thrust is used to slow down its descent. After the player has successfully landed, an astronaut enters the shuttle which takes off again. To make it back to the space station, the player once again has to navigate through the meteors but this time he or she can use a laser to blast through them. The player also has to watch out for alien flagships that lurk behind meteors. Once all six astronauts have been rescued, the player gets bonus points and moves on to the next level.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This simple ASCII-graphics TRS-80 game has you guiding a \"Grand Prix\" race car down a twisting racetrack that is filled with potholes. The object is to make it to the finish line of each racetrack after which you advance to the next difficulty level and must take on a more dangerous track. If you run off the road or hit one of the potholes you must start the race over again. The game is played from an overhead view with your car driving \"down\" the screen as the roadway and obstacles scroll up from the bottom of the screen. The controls allow you to steer left and right at two different rates - normal and fast. Difficulty is increased during gameplay by moving the position of your car gradually lower on the screen, giving you less time to react to curves and potholes.</p>\n<p>The game offered rudimentary sound if you plugged the TRS-80 cassette cable into a speaker.</p>",

Like in Defender, the player can move the ship both left and right and has to protect a number of ground targets, here five cities. There is also a radar display that shows an overview with the locations of cities and enemies. In addition to shooting the aliens as they appear the player can also activate shields that offer protection to the cities. These however require energy which is only available in limited supply. Similarities with Scramble include a mountainous terrain that the player has to avoid crashing into and enemy ground targets that can be attacked. To be able to do so the player first has to collect an incendiary star shell that then can be dropped on the target.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Space Attack</em> is a shoot 'em up that mixes elements from a number of popular arcade games of its time. The player's task is to defend a city which, like in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Missile+Command\">Missile Command</a>, occupies the bottom part of the screen. The city is being attacked by aliens unleashed by a feared warlord who aims to fully destroy it. The aliens attack from above and move around in patterns similar to fixed screen shoot 'em ups like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Galaxian\">Galaxian</a>. They drop bombs on the buildings on the surface and the player has to shoot them down before they do so. Controlling the spaceship is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Asteroids\">Asteroids</a>, with a combination of thrust and rotation allowing it to move all over the screen and shoot in any direction. In addition to the regular fire, a super weapon can be used but it's limited to three uses. Another thing to watch out for is the fuel level of the ship. It's necessary to land and refill it before it runs out.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Wild West</em> lets the player take control of the famous outlaw Jesse James who has to escape a Texas Rangers ambush. The game is played from a top down perspective and Jesse can move and shoot in multiple directions. The game starts out in a house that is being attacked by two rangers. The walls of the building offer some protection but will ultimately break down by shots, both those from the player and those from the attackers. Once all enemies have been killed the game moves on to the next screen which features a different layout. Later activities in the game involve trying to rob a stolen payroll from a tribe of Indians, boarding a mail train and finally a heist at the Dodge City bank. Being hit leads to a lost life and when all three are gone, the game is over.</p>",

The gameplay remains the same in this version, with the player controlling a race car through a maze, and the aim is to collect all the flags that are scattered around the map. At the same time, there are enemy cars that chase the player and in this variant there are as many as eight already in the first level. The player's car has limited fuel and if all flags aren't collected in time, the car will go slower and ultimately stop. If there is fuel left, the player will start with a fuel bonus in the next level. In addition to normal flags, there are also bonus flags that double the points earned. Like in the arcade game, it's possible to distract the enemy cars with the use of a smoke screen.</p>",

For starters, the maze is empty when the game starts and instead of eating all the dots the objective is to drop dots so that the whole maze is completely covered by them. The other big difference is how the power pills (here called stimulators) work. Like in Pac-Man they allow the player (the laser ball) to go after the enemies (which are called destructoids) but instead of eating them it shoots lasers at them. Lasers are only available for a short while but there is no limit on how many shots can be made within that time. If the laser ball is touched by a destructoid during this time, the destructoid will piggyback on the ball and destroy it when the charge ends. To shake it off, the player has to turn a three- or four way intersection at a 90 degree angle.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Learning Fun 1: Scurve Invaders</em> is an educational game that combines space shooting with maths problem solving. The player controls a space ship down the bottom of the screen and has to shoot at the aliens (called scurves) that move back and forth above him. Unlike other shoot 'em ups aliens appear one at a time. Before shooting is possible the ship has to be loaded and this is done by solving a single maths problem. Once solved the player can shoot as much as he wants until the alien is hit. Points are awarded for each hit and removed for each miss. After one alien has been defeated another appears and the ship has to be loaded with another question. There is no way to die in the game but the game ends when the time runs out. Bonus time is earned when score reaches 5000.</p>",

As such it is a shoot 'em up that takes place in a grid-like maze where the player's ship starts out in the bottom right corner while eight alien ramships start out in the top row. As the game begins, the ramships will start chasing the player who has to shoot them to prevent getting caught. In addition to the ramships there are flagships that initially are located to the right, outside the playing field. From there they can zap the ramships and thereby turn them into clones of the player's ship. These have to be avoided since shooting them will lead to the player too getting killed. Once all ramships have been destroyed the flagships will enter the playing field and they have to be destroyed to progress to the next level. Flagships can hit the player with laser bolts from any position in the maze (and they never miss) but the player can take six such hits before being destroyed.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Computer Foreign Exchange</em> is a conversion of Avalon Hill's own 1979 board game. It retains all the original rules and options and can be played by two to four players but does not feature any AI opponents. Each player takes control of a business with assets all around the world. The game world consists of 24 cities in nine countries which are evenly divided between the players. Each player has when starting out one sales office in each controlled city. The first phase of the game is a trading session where players can trade cities they control. Players should attempt to hold all cities within one country since that allows them to build manufacturing subsidiaries and thereby increase profits.</p>\n<p>After the trading session, the players take turns planning their strategies for each fiscal year. There are several options that can be made: purchase sales offices or manufacturing subsidiaries, hedge foreign assets, borrow foreign currencies, use a cash management consulting service, sell sales offices or manufacturing subsidiaries, use a foreign exchange advisory service and list ownership and assets of each city. After the planning has been completed, players enter their jets and fly to the different cities. Players can control this by holding down the spacebar to fuel the jet and the longer it is held down, the longer it will fly. If players land in an opponent's city, they have to pay for it.</p>\n<p>The game goes on until one player has reached a target amount of money. The target is based on which difficulty level (1-9) is chosen before the start of a game. The higher the difficulty, the more net worth is required to win.</p>",

The screen is split in two by a large mountain with the player being located on its left side and waves of alien attackers appearing on the right side. The aim of the game is simply to kill the aliens by sending projectiles over the mountain while at the same time avoiding their projectiles. The player can move left and right and shoot projectiles from four different angles. Additionally there is an option to drill into the mountain which then offers some protection. There are three kinds of enemies: attackers that launch projectiles from the ground, protectors which fly past and build force fields above the ground units and robot climbers which climb the mountain and attack from there. As the game goes on, the space available for movement shrinks which makes it harder to avoid enemy projectiles.</p>",

The game is played on a 7x7 grid where each square represents a galactic sector in deep space. The tribble, which is hidden, moves between the sectors and the player's task is to trap it without killing it. The only info given about it is its position the previous turn. For each turn the player can shoot out one of the sectors by entering its coordinates. That then prevents the tribble from moving to it. The game is won when all the sectors surrounding the tribble are destroyed since it then can't make any further moves. It is game over if the tribble is shot or if all available shots are used up.</p>",

Around the frog there are numerous flies swarming around and the aim of the game is simply to eat all the flies. The frog can be moved left and right along the log and flies are eaten by sending out the tongue either to the left or right diagonally. The more the tongue is used the shorter it will get and hence the flies will be harder to catch. Once all flies have been caught, the player gets a score that is based on the number of them and how long it took.</p>",

The objective of the game is to drive 600 miles (from Boston to Washington) and first reach the finish line. </p>\n<p>In each turn each player gets four cards of which they have to choose one to use or pass. There are three groups of cards: mileage (from 10 to 50 miles), revenge (stop, flat, empty and wreck) and repair (roll, spare, gas and fix). The mileage cards are used to move, the revenge cards are used to halt the movement of the opponents and the repair cards are used to counter the revenge cards. The cards that can be played depends on the player's condition. A mileage card can only be used when the condition is \"roll\" and a revenge card can only be used on an opponent that is rolling. Revenge cards changes the condition to \"stop\" and the player must then use the corresponding repair card to start rolling again. Cards are given randomly and if a player gets two of the same repair cards a protection will be given which gives immunity against the corresponding revenge card.</p>",

Each hole contains beans and the objective is to move the highest amount of beans to the player's home which is the hole furthest to the right. In each move the player picks up all beans from one hole and then drops one in each hole going counter-clockwise. Each hole is numbered and for each turn the player simply enters the hole that beans should be moved from.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Slalom</em> is a downhill skiing game. There are three courses to choose from: slalom, giant slalom and downhill and the aim in all of them is simply to go down the slope in the shortest time while trying to manoeuvre through each gate. The game does however not keep track of whether the player goes through the gates or not which has to be determined by the player. The slope is seen from a top down perspective and the player simply uses two keys to turn left and right. Hitting a ski pole will lead to an accident and an early end to the race.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Lafayette Escadrille</em> is a real time action, simulation and strategy game putting the player in control of World War I biplanes. You can select from 24 different aircraft including the classics such as German Fokker DR-1, French Spad or English Sopwith Camel. A variety of missions can be flown from defensive or offensive patrols, bombing missions, balloon busting and training flights. Mission duration is generally around 20-35 cycles (a cycle is the period it takes for the cursor in the upper right hand corner of the screen to blink on and off once). Using the paper battle map provided aids in course and target finding. The battle map is also simulated on screen with limited graphic and text symbols.</p>\n<p>Game play is from a top down perspective with the player controlling the selected plane in X and Y grid. Keyboard entry uses unique keys allows common dogfight maneuvers such as Split-S or Immelmann turns. Each aircraft has differing rates of fuel consumption, ammo and bomb load capacities. After landing back at your aerodrome or crashing a score screen appears. The game has no option for mid-mission or in flight game saves.</p>",

Two gunslingers (human vs. human or human vs. computer) face each other in a duel. The players can move up and down along the sides of the screen, aim by raising or lowering the firing arm and then shoot at the enemy. Some cover is offered in the form of obstacles: trees, cacti and a moving wagon. Reloading is automatic but takes a few seconds. The game keeps track of scores but is endless and there are no winning conditions.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Zossed In Space</em> follows the adventures of an unnamed spacecraft captain, impersonated by the player. There is no story, the goal is simply to survive a hundred sectors of space. Two alternate winning conditions are to either kill ten enemy ships or accumulate a hundred trade units.</p>\n<p>In each sector, the ship appears on the bottom of the screen. It is directly controlled with four keys (left, right, up, down) to interact with respectively to avoid whatever is on screen. After reaching the top, the next sector begins. The most important aspect of survival is fuel management: the ship has five systems (weapons, propulsion, life support, defense and environment shields) which constantly use fuel. With a button press, the player enters command mode and can divide the main fuel reserve into the specific systems. This mode also serves as pause function.</p>\n<p>Life support, environment shields and propulsion need to be over 0% at all times because otherwise the ship can't move anymore (propulsion) or instantly dies (the other two). Defense can theoretically be empty, but then encountering an enemy ships causes instant death. Weapons only need to be fueled for combat. Fuel is not only depleted over time, but also when encountering dangerous environments. For example, being hit by meteorites hurts the environmental shield fuel, the black whole drains life support or space junk the propulsion reserve. </p>\n<p>After each screen is passed, the sector counter goes up by one. However, not all screens are dangerous. The player may also find traders (sell trade units for fuel), tankers (sell fuel for sectors) or free ports (allow to gamble for more trade units).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Demon Venture: Reign of the Red Dragon</em> is an early TRS-80 RPG featuring black and white graphics.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of each dungeon crawl, the player creates a party of 1 - 5 characters. Character races include: hobbit, dwarf, elf, and human. Starting classes include: warrior, magician, cleric, and thief. On character creation, player's statistics are randomly generated, and the player must purchase their starting equipment prior to entering the dungeon. Dungeon exploration is performed via an overhead view, with the player represented by an asterisk. Dungeon layout is randomized each adventure. The player randomly encounters chests and wandering monsters as they explore. The goal of the game is to descend to lower levels, and gather the eight pieces of the magic scepter. This will enrage the titular Red Dragon, and cause it to attack the player. Victory is achieved by slaying the fiend.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is turn-based, but has a timed component. If a player sits idle, they will be attacked by wandering monsters. In combat, the player has a limited time to input combat commands, or they will not act during that round. The player is armed with throwing weapons, which must be aimed at creatures in combat using cross-hairs. Players will randomly encounter traps and chests, which can damage the player. When all available characters are deceased, it is game over.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Starfighter</em> is a black &amp; white 3D space combat simulation, as well as a strategy game for the TRS-80. The game has 2 modes, a combat trainer and campaign mode.</p>\n<p>The player plays as a mercenary pilot working for the Solar Galactic Authority, who is currently at war with the Petro Resource Conglomerate. The player is awarded credits for destroying enemy vessels, as well as rogue merchant ships and marauder Solar Galactic Authority vessels. The game is played from a first person point of view, and the player's ship can hyperdrive into different galactic zones to hunt enemy vessels. The accumulated credits can be used to facilitate ship repairs or purchase upgrades for their vessel at a landbase. The player can also refuel at these landbases and acquire bounties. If the player runs out of fuel, they need to request a tow to the nearest landbase at great expense. </p>\n<p>The player starts off with the rank of New Pilot, and can advance to Ensign, Inspector, Captain, and finally Star Lord. The ultimate goal of the game is to claim the rank of Star Lord.</p>",

The tunnels are laid out in a grid-like pattern, and the player is able to look in all four directions at any time, allowing them to examine 4 parts of every square room for clues. The game only accepts 2-word responses, and a graphical display is presented to the character of what is in each room. The last 5 inputs are stored on the top right corner for the player to evaluate. </p>\n<p>In <em>The Sledge of Rahmul</em>, the player enters a darkened cavern in search of the eponymous Sledge of Rahmul. As they enter, a deafening voice rings out, sealing the cavern behind them. Once again, the dungeon is arranged in a square grid, and the player must look in all 4 directions in each square room to gather clues. All commands are via text input, with a graphical display of the player's viewpoint. The player is awarded a score after exiting the dungeon, based upon the number of puzzles they have solved.</p>",

The player and mummy move in opposing directions. At breaks in the track, the player uses the arrow keys to move 1 or 2 lanes, while the mummy can move up to 1 lane. If the player comes in contact with the mummy, they lose a life. The goal is to always be in a different lane than the mummy while crossing. 1000 bonus points are awarded for collecting all pieces of silver in one life, and the track is reset each life. The player starts with 3 lives, and a bonus life is awarded at 2000 points. When all are lost, it's game over.</p>",

For instance, the player can always start with two cards totaling 16, and can simulate 100 games where they hold and 100 games where they draw another card. They can then compare which strategy leads to optimized victory conditions. </p>\n<p>The player can also set dealer characteristics, such as if a new deck of cards is drawn each game, or at what values the computer will hold or draw a new card to optimize strategies against such an opponent. Betting strategies can be optimized by simulating large or low bets with specific card combinations.</p>",

The objective is to seek out and defeat the leader of the alien race the Dorfians who is hiding at the bottom of a black hole. The game controls the same in all sections with the player being able to move right and left, shoot and use a shield to block projectiles.</p>\n<p>The first section involves getting through a long corridor without getting hit by any of the meteoroids flying past. This is made more difficult by the walls constantly moving towards the centre with little space left towards the end. In the second part the alien leader appears at the top of the screen. He is protected by a moving wall that has to be shot through. As time goes, the wall descends towards the player's position. The third section is similar to the mother ship stage in Phoenix. The player has to hit a target in the middle of the ship but first break down its underside. Once completed the game restarts at the first section.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Terror at Selachii Bay</em> is a 1-player strategy game.</p>\n<p>The player controls a boat and a crew, with the goal to hunt the shark which stalks Selachii Bay. The player must explore the bay, as displayed overhead, looking for the shark on their sonar. After locating the shark, the player must choose to fire a harpoon in 1 of the 4 cardinal directions, as well as choose from 4 separate depths. \n The combination required to hit the shark is determined by trial and error. The shark will intermittently change its location, and will move to a new place on the map whenever the player returns to the marina for supplies. If the shark is struck by 3 harpoons, it will die. </p>\n<p>There are numerous dangers facing the captain and crew. Random storms will cause loss of supplies and crew. The player must avoid running aground or into shipwrecks, as the ship will rapidly take on water and sink. The player can also take damage from shark attacks, forcing the player to take time to repair their vessel at sea. Old mines dispersed through the bay require the player to remember an old man's password from the start of each game, or risk being blown apart.</p>",

The player and their opponent both start by controlling 1\u20132 systems, and must build their resources by colonizing adjacent systems. This allows the player to create a manufacturing base that allows them to construct ships to war with their opponent.

There is no computer opponent available, and actions for both teams must be chosen by the players. During each play, both players choose a respective offensive or defensive play, and then the computer graphically displays the action. If a play is not chosen fast enough, the team will become confused and will perform errors. The players can not control a play in progress. At the end of each play, the current score is displayed. Each team can call 3 timeouts per game.</p>",

Every several levels, a resupply ship appears on the screen. The player must align their ship with the docking port in order to receive more fuel, while avoiding or destroying the alien mothership. The player receives a new spaceship every 10,000 points. The player starts with 3 ships, and when all are lost, it's game over.</p>",

At the beginning of each game, a large spider-like creature distributes a number of fuel cells on the level, and the player's goal is to protect these from incoming aliens. The player must shoot aliens, while avoiding running into them. If an alien grasps a fuel cell, they will attempt to fly off with it to the top of the screen. If an alien carrying a fuel cell is shot, the cell falls to the ground. It will be destroyed, unless the player stays beneath it to catch it. The player starts with 3 lives, and loses a life when they are hit. The game is over when all fuel cells are lost, or the player loses all lives. A new life is awarded every 10,000 points.</p>",

The ship can move forwards, and has a cannon that can shoot forwards. On the screen are a number of asteroids which move about, and if they strike the player, the player is destroyed. Each asteroid that is shot breaks into two smaller pieces, and then two smaller pieces again if hit, finally being destroyed on the third hit. The player must also contend with spaceships which fire at the player. The initials of the game's authors float about, and can be shot for bonus points. The player starts with 3 lives, and when all are lost, it's game over. The goal is to maximize score.</p>",

You are auditioning to be the new Imperial Advisor on Economic Affairs for the Galactic Empire.</p>\n<p>2) Romulan - A cross between a space shooter and Battleship, you're trying to find and shoot down a cloaked Romulan ship (from Star Trek)</p>\n<p>3) Star Wars - This seems to be the \"classic\" Star Wars game created just after the original movie's release. You move your gun sights until you line up with the TIE Fighters, and then blow them away. Probably inspired by the scene in the movie where Luke and Han man the gunner turrets in the Millennium Falcon.</p>\n<p>4) Ultra Trek - Yet another variety of the classic Star Trek mainframe game, where you need to defeat a certain number of Klingon ships in a certain number of turns using your phasers and photon torpedoes.</p>",

As the player flies, intermittent poor weather will drive their plane vertically and horizontally, and the player must correct for these aberrations. The player must evade freak thunderstorms. The player also has a fuel gauge, and must make stops at airports along their route to Chicago to refuel, to avoid crashing. The player must carefully land on a runway as it appears on the bottom of the screen, and if they miss, they must fly on.

        "description": "<p>This is a compilation of three games:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Knight's Quest</em> is a role-playing game in which the player plays a young knight of the Kingdom of Norsax. The knight has just come of age to partake in their first quest. The king will ask to either retrieve the Gold Chalice from the Mountain Demon or the Gold Anchor from the Sea Demon. The player must move to different locations in the kingdom by following roads, and it takes them 1 day to travel to a new location on the map. As the player moves, they can encounter foes, who can be challenged to combat, or may challenge to player to battle. If the player is successful they receive silver coins, but also take damage dependent on their own reputation and the monster's strength. These silver coins can be used to restore the player's strength, as they heal if they spend more than one day in a location. The player can encounter healing springs which increase the rate of healing. The player can also encounter monasteries, which may grant a silver dagger that can automatically win a combat. As the player explores, they will learn the location of their true foe, and if victorious in combat, can return their treasure to the castle in the center of the map. The quest is over when the player returns to the castle or is killed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Robot Chase</em> is a version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Chase\">Chase</a>. The player is inside a large arena surrounded by enemy robots. Many high voltage tiles are present and the player must try to lure the robots into those tiles to take them out.</p>\n</li>\n<li><em>Horse Race</em> is a horse betting game in which the player can bet on five horses.</li>\n</ul>",

The goal is to trap the opponent so that they can not move, causing them to lose the game. The players can optionally have barriers on the map, and can choose to start with 5 shots to free themselves when stuck. There are 3 different speeds available.

The player must escape through a predetermined number of rooms, and each room has three exits. One exit is safe, while the other two contain either a ghost, a vampire, or a werewolf. If the player encounters an enemy they do not have the correct warding device for, they must quickly type the appropriate defensive spell: \"stake\" for vampires, \"light\" for ghosts, or \"fleas\" for werewolves. If the player misspells the word, or does not type fast enough, they are defeated and it's game over. The player must try to escape through all rooms to freedom.</p>",

The player and enemies can also loop off one side of the screen and appear on the opposite. On each level, the player's goal is to destroy all enemy vessels with increasingly difficult alien waves. Levels occur in a pattern, where the first level consists of a number of fast moving vessels that flit randomly about the screen. The second level consists of vessels that home in on the player, initially in 4 parts, they combine at a center area, and then move about randomly. The third wave consists of an alien base, whose shield must be shot out and destroyed. These three level types then repeat at progressively higher difficulty. The player gains a bonus score for finishing a level quickly, and has a total of three spaceships.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dungeon Escape</em> is a 1-player role playing game for the TRS-80.</p>\n<p>The player's goal is to escape from a series of dungeons by navigating progressively more difficult levels. The goal on each level is to collect the required number of stones, and return to the starting point of the level, allowing access to the next challenge. </p>\n<p>The player can choose from 3 different classes: fighter, thief, or mage. The fighter has unparalleled combat strength, but cannot cast spells. The mage starts with a number of spells, but is weak. The thief can cast spells, but starts with none, and has moderate combat strength. The player can set the game speed, and can also choose to have ghosts, which will chase the player through the dungeon and end their lives instantly if they come in contact with the player.</p>\n<p>Each level consists of a series of rooms connected by corridors. Within each room, the player may find a trap, a combat encounter, or a stone. The player may also find items in each room, including gold, magic spells, improved armor and weapons, healing elixirs, or magic maps. The player may also encounter leprechauns, which can steal the player's map, making them move blind until they discover a new map. Gold serves to increase the player's score. Magic spells consist of teleport, which moves the player randomly about the map, fireball, which causes massive damage to an enemy, and locate stone, which shows the location of all stones on the level. The player also has the ability to save their game for a later outing, and to commit harakiri if they are unhappy with their game. </p>\n<p>During combat, the player can encounter 1 to several enemies, all of whom attack the player one at a time. One enemy and the player take turns swinging at each other. The player can attack, parry, or thrust each round, and can also utilize magic spells and heal. Combat is timed, and if the player attempts a command during the enemy's turn, they will lose the proceeding turn allowing the monster an additional strike.</p>",

The vessel has 4 speeds, and can move in the four cardinal directions, while the screen can scroll vertically and horizontally. The player must explore the maze and destroy all mushrooms present within. The player is hunted by a giant spider, which lays baby spiders, and continuously moves towards the player. The giant spider cannot be destroyed, but it will be stunned if shot. The spider progressively speeds up as its babies are destroyed. Players can destroy walls and mountains to create new paths to travel. Bags of gold are dispersed throughout the maze, and destroying these causes the player to lose points. The player can set the difficulty level from A - Z which controls enemy speed, but also the terrain they play on. The player starts with 5 ATVs, and it's game over if all are lost.</p>",

The player controls a small character in the center of the screen, while enemy creatures move about in available spaces. The player can move through solid ground leaving tunnels behind, and the enemies can intermittently become ghosts and move through the ground to attack the player. Each enemy takes five hits to destroy, but becomes stunned while the player shoots at them. The goal for each level is to destroy all present enemies to move to a more difficult challenge. Rocks can be used to crush enemies, and gold can be picked up for bonus points. The player has a total of three lives, and loses one if struck by an enemy.</p>",

From the 3 exits of the screen come thieves, who attempt to sneak to the money and run off with it to the room exits. The player must try to capture the thieves before they reach the money by running into them without shooting them, thus sending the thief to the brig. After stealing money, the thief becomes a fugitive, and becomes dangerous if touched. The player receives points for shooting a thief or fugitive, and if a fugitive is shot the money returns to the center. Protectors also appear, which move towards the player, and will take a life if touched. Each level, the player must capture a certain number of thieves to advance to the next challenge. The player has 3 lives, and if all are lost or if all 18 pieces of gold are stolen, it's game over.</p>",

The player can receive hints including an overhead view of the map, but this will reduce their score. On lower difficulty, the player is shown how far they are from the cheese. The player can opt for a small or large maze, and on harder levels there are invisible barriers and passageways that stretch to infinity.</p>",

When all bricks are collected, the player advances to a more difficult level with more monsters. If the player is touched by a monster, they lose a life. A new life is awarded every 10,000 points.

You play as the starship commander and your mission is to fight and destroy the other spacecraft which have plagued the galaxy. This game features three different weapons to dispose of your enemies with, photon torpedoes, phasers, and the ultimate weapon - Corbomite devices which can destroy all enemy ships in the quadrant. The galaxy in which you play within comes in a variety of sizes. Size is measured by the number of levels in the galaxy. This can range from 2, 3, 4, or 5 levels, each of which is divided into 9 quadrants with each quadrant being divided into 81 sectors. Each sector is an X/Y coordinance in which your starship or an enemy could be residing, much like the classic board game, <em>Battleship</em>. The game can be played in one of six different difficulty modes available.</p>",

Build your spaceship from 21 different available modules to see what strategies work best against your opponents. After designing your craft, the game will run a test and check your ship before shooting you off into space. Once finished, you're up against an opponent in one of three different game modes in either a two or three dimensional galaxy. Game modes consist of: Smuggler, try to get from one side of the screen, around your opponent, and to your base with as much cargo or passengers as you can. Refuel, a one-on-one shoot-out between you and an opponent; game mode allows you to go back to base to refuel with the goal of destroying the enemy. Phoenix Decathlon, a tournament where you face-off against each of the ten computer AI's pre-designed spaceships with the goal of beating them all and being championed as a \"Space Ace\".</p>",

These appear on the screen, and steadily get larger, and the player must shoot them before they reach the player. The player gets increased points for shooting an enemy further away, but if they fail to shoot them in time, it's game over. After this, they must shoot the rapidly moving Darth Vader. Finally, the player must line up and shoot a torpedo down the Death Star's plasma exhaust to achieve victory.</p>",

A large centipede begins to descend the screen by travelling in rows, and the player must shoot all pieces of the centipede before it reaches the bottom of the screen. When the creature is hit, it divides into smaller pieces, and leaves blockades behind. Spiders appear on the screen to attack the player. Fleas drop from above and scorpions travel horizontally across the screen. When the player clears a level, they move to a more difficult challenge. The player has 3 lives, and when all are lost, it's game over.</p>",

There are 3 levels of pitching difficulty.</p>",

The chimps regularly banter with each other and insult the player. One at a time, a player places 1 - 4 card on the table facing down. They then must announce a series of card, such as \"three aces\" or \"two fours\". Any of the four players can then announce if they believe the series of cards matches what the player announces. If the player's cards are not questioned, they stay on the table to be picked up at a future time. When questioned, if the player is lying, they must pick up all cards on the table, otherwise the person who falsely accused the player must pick up all the cards. It's game over when one player has used all of their cards.</p>",

If the player eats an energizer, the zonkers can temporarily become vulnerable, and run from the player. A tame zonker, if eaten, is sent back to the starting area. When the player consumes all dots, they move to a new maze and gain a new gobbler. The player starts with 3 gobblers, and when all are lost, it's game over.</p>",

The player has limited 200 points of shield which briefly makes them invulnerable. If the player is hit, they need to restart the level, and all enemies must be destroyed to proceed.

During this era, staking a claim on the piece of land where you intend to dig was essential. And you always had to be on the lookout for claim jumpers. </p>\n<p>Played on a 5 x 5 board, players take turns staking a claim on the board. The goal is to collect as many squares as possible, with the rule being no player can claim a square on any of the 4 sides of their opponent's claim. The center square can never be claimed first. The game continues until no more squares can be played, and the player with the most squares gets points based upon how many more squares they have than their opponent. Allows for 2-player or 1-player versus computer gameplay. The first player to reach 7 points is the winner.</p>",

While you were out charting asteroids, the entire defense fleet was being devastated by Zargonian Invasion. It happened so quickly that you didn't even receive any distress calls until after you returned - to find the entire fleet in ruins. </p>\n<p>Played on a 10 x 10 grid, there are 10 space stations, 20 Zargonian battleships, and a single Zargonian planet, which serves as their resupply point. The player is armed with 5 torpedoes, and if they move to a battleship square, they must quickly blast the enemy ship before their shields are depleted. The player must visit all 10 space stations to receive a piece of the planet killer. They can also resupply at this point. Upon receiving the planet killer, they can venture to the enemy planet to destroy it, and protect the Confederation.</p>\n<p>Difficulty levels from 1 to 20 are available.</p>",

Played in a series of 95 numbered rooms set out in a series of interconnecting circles, the goal is to retrieve all 20 treasures randomly hidden throughout the maze and return them to the dungeon exit in room 0. Time is limited by a limited number of charges of their lamp to illuminate the mazes, but this can be increased by recovering coins and bringing them to a vending machine for lamp fuel. There are dangers through the map including a dragon, a cave-in, and a bottomless pit that will end the game if the player wanders into the incorrect room unprepared. Pirates can steal a player's treasure, and earthquakes can rearrange locations on the map. The player will be warned when they're 1 room away from the danger, but won't be told which room it is in. Some of the treasures are required to solve puzzles or defeat enemies.</p>",

At the beginning of each expedition, the player must choose from a limited number of cameras, supplies, guides, and bearers to accompany them. Each move on the grid costs a number of supplies. Guides increase the odds of finding an animal. After finding an animal, the player enters an arcade section, where they must try to position a moving animal in the center of their camera frame to take a good picture. Supplies dwindle quickly while photographing. Points are awarded for the number of animal pictures successfully captured. There are 3 levels of difficulty.</p>",

The player controls the ballast and gas of their hot air balloon. Wind direction varies with altitude and position, and the player controls their flight path by adjusting their altitude. The player receives points based upon how close they come to Paris, France, and the time to their landing. The higher altitudes have more northerly winds. Ambient temperatures are expressed in Kalvin, and temperature changes during the day. The game is played from the sideview, where the player influences altitude, and time passes in quick 3 minute intervals. The radio can be used to determine player location, although the player is sometime outside of radio contact. The player has a limited supply of gas and ballast, and the player may not reach their destination if these run out. At altitude over 28,000 feet, gas is lost.</p>",

Alien defense systems continuously fire towards the player, and if the alien aligns with open shields, it will also fire through the defense system. If the lowest level of shields is overly damaged, a new level of shield forms, and the shield levels are shifted downwards.

You have just been appointed general of a small and struggling army, in a small and struggling country. You should consider this an honor, even though the army has had six generals in the last two months. Somehow, each general seemed to mysteriously disappear after a battle was lost. </p>\n<p>To defeat the enemy nation, you must conquer The Zeighty Pass, a highly defended pass through an otherwise impassable mountain range, and the sole supply route for the enemy's advanced troops. If the pass can be conquered, the tide of war will turn in your nation's favor. </p>\n<p>The player arranges an army of 10 units, which can be chosen from armored infantry, tanks, mine layers, and artillery. Armored infantry and tanks serve as combat troops, while artillery can bombard enemy positions from a distance. Mine layers can deploy mines to destroy enemy units. Gameplay occurs on a battlefield, where the player can move their units in 8 directions, and issue attack commands. The player controls a home base, which must be defended, and fog of war allows enemy units to hide when at a sufficient range. Each unit starts with 1000 health units, and will progressively take damage during combat until they are destroyed. Victory is achieved by destroying the enemy's base to the north.</p>",

The flight is routine until you hit the landing gear switch. You hear a loud noise, and notice something fallen from the plane. You verify the engines are still there, but the landing gear has fallen off. Luckily, due to your excellent navigational abilities, you find yourself near the Grand Canyon. A plan is quickly made to fill the canyon with foam and have the passengers jump into it. </p>\n<p>A large plane flies sequentially from the left and the right. The player can choose to launch a passenger forward with some or increased forward velocity. If the passenger successfully lands in foam, they are saved, reducing the available foam. There are 3 available levels: box valley, valley, and volcano. The player can also create custom levels. The player chooses how much foam is remaining before the level is reset, and can play by time or number of misses</p>",

The player can choose to have obstacles to dodge, or can play on an empty field. On easy mode, the player can see their tail, while in hard mode they cannot. There are 5 options for game speed. As the player moves, their score increases. At 100 points, a small ball begins to bounce on the screen. At 200 points, a bigger ball begins to bounce, that wrecks the previously laid out tail. At 300 points, another little ball appears, and at 400 points a large ball with a string attached appears, but when it hits a wall it breaks, allowing the player to travel through these breaks. For every 100 points, another small or big ball progressively appears.</p>",

Each turn, the player can travel fast or slow. Travelling fast uses up more of the camel's energy, while travelling slow will allow the pygmies to catch up. The player starts with a limited supply of water, and the player must stop to drink every 6 days. They can randomly find oases as they travel. Every few days, the camel must rest, and the camel can also become injured by sandstorms. If the camel is pushed too hard, it will die, and the game is over. The player can also get captured by fierce and wild Tartarians, and the player can try to escape, or may get held for ransom.</p>",

You must overcome 5 levels of a dangerous dungeon and retrieve treasures and defeat monsters.</p>\n<p>Each level is arranged in a large field, where the player can only see the items directly surrounding them. The goal is to defeat every monster and retrieve all treasures. Monsters are stationary, and enter combat when approached, or the player takes a treasure adjacent to them. </p>\n<p>The player starts with 300 hit points. In combat, each monster has a hit point value. Using the same number of hit points as the monster gives a 50% chance of winning the battle. Using 200% gives a 100% chance of winning the battle. After each combat, the player recovers hit points based upon the amount used, with a higher risk of failure leading to greater hit point recovery. The player only gains more hit points than they started with if there is a risk of losing combat. If the player uses less than 150% hit points and is defeated, they are killed, and the game is over. </p>\n<p>Any time outside of combat, the player can convert their score to hit points. 10% of the score can be converted each time, with a conversion of 1:1 of the first conversion, 1:2 on the second, and so forth.</p>",

After bringing their army to confront General Tarkaan, the game briefly takes on a strategy component, where the player chooses military tactics from a list. At the end of the adventure, the length of the player's reign is determined by how many turns were required to complete the game. </p>\n<p>All entries are via VERB NOUN entry.

The goal is to place six pieces within a space on the board, but dots cannot overlap, and it may take multiple pieces to complete each box. Each of the 6 pieces can be rotated, placed, or changed. Every placement or changing requires a turn. Each piece played yields that number of points, and the player gains 6 points for each square filled, at which point that square is again emptied. Bonus points can be gained by reaching exactly 50 points, or completing a 6 point square is a predetermined space. The goal is to be the first player to reach 100 points.</p>",

There are 4 shields around the Earth at the bottom of the screen, and a row of Venerians at the top of the screen. The creatures drop down on top of the shields, and if more than 2 aliens are present on the shields at a time, the shield fails. The player controls a small ship which moves horizontally, and can run into a fallen Venerian to remove them from the shield. If a Venerian falls on the player, it counts as an extra Venerian on the shield. After surviving a screen of Venerians, a new screen appears with faster moving aliens. Then game is over when all 4 shields are destroyed.</p>",

Each square is a door, and only one door can be opened at a time. The goal is to capture as many suns as possible by opening a door just before the sun reaches it. Suns can also be captured by shooting a missile from one of the 9 doors, but only one missile can be fired at a time. If a missile is fired from a door without a sun, it will bounce until it is recaptured again by opening a door. There are 8 levels of difficulty, which determine the maximum suns that can be on the screen at a time from 1 - 8. There are also 5 speed levels to choose from. The player has 100 seconds to collect as many suns as possible.</p>",

The player can apply horizontal and vertical thrust on their lander, while gravity continually accelerates the probe towards the planet surface. The goal is to land on a flat area at a speed of less than 15 meters/second with a horizontal speed of 0. The player starts on a zoomed-out screen, but as they approach closer to the surface the terrain and lander appear larger to facilitate landing. The player can determine their starting fuel in increments of 500, and whether to play in light or heavy gravity.</p>",

If the player fills all 4 squares they receive a point, but if there are overlapping blocks, they are erased, and the player doesn't receive a point. A player cannot give 2 pieces in a row. Turns are timed, and If neither player gives or takes, the computer receives the piece. The computer pieces do not get erased if they overlap, allowing the computer to more easily run up a score.

You have been left alone to defend it until colonists arrive. After a couple of days of quiet monitors, something appears on your comp-scan: An entire fleet of alien star destroyers - heading your way. Springing from your chair, you flip a few switches to activate the force field. The force field covers most of the planet, but not directly over the armory, creating a window for invading aliens to slip through. </p>\n<p>The player controls a missile which moves horizontally along the bottom of the screen and fires vertically. Alien waves move as a group, and when they reach the edge of the screen, they move down one level and alternate direction. Within the armory are 4 missile launchers, and if one is destroyed, a new one takes its place. One replacement missile launcher is constructed at the end of an alien wave up to 4. Each alien wave arrives one level lower than the preceding fleet, and the player has time to repair their defensive barrier between waves. The game ends when an alien breaks through the armory's barrier line or all 4 missile launchers are destroyed. There are 3 levels of game speed.</p>",

Your country is beset by many problems: no industry, little trade, small army, underpopulation, angry neighbors, plague, and other day-to-day problems a capable leader must learn to face. You'll have a limited number of turns to build your empire into a great size. Five other city-states are also struggling to become emperor, and are directly competing with you. There are a limited number of turns per game based upon the short medieval life expectancy. </p>\n<p>Each turn, the player is given a weather report which affects crop yields. The player has a chance to purchase or sell grain, as well as allot grain to the army and peasants. This affects birth/death rates, and army efficiency. Each turn, the player also gets to set customs duty, sales tax, and income tax, and can purchase market places, grain mills, foundries, shipyards, soldiers, or work on constructing their palace. These can be used to gain future resources.</p>\n<p>Each turn the player can attack attacking barbarian and opponent forces to gain their land and seize their resources, and the player must maintain a standing army by feeding them and paying resources.</p>\n<p>As your country increases in size, you will be rewarded with lofty titles including Knight, Prince, King, and finally Emperor.</p>",

These vessels sink slowly, and the player can have up to 5 depth charges on the screen at a time. Enemy subs sail under the water, and fire torpedoes towards the player. If the player is hit, they lose half their points. The player has 90 seconds to destroy as many subs as possible. If they reach 500 points, they gain an additional 20 seconds.</p>",

The player can move in the 4 cardinal directions, and so can the monster. The player must reach an oxygen control unit within a maze, and bring it to the oxygen device. While doing this, they must avoid a monster which continuously chases them. The player can drill through walls to reach their goal. After the oxygen is turned on, the monster will pursue for some time before succumbing. The player has 500 time units, but time is only displayed during the last 100 units. There are 9 levels of difficulty, with harder levels being more open, making it easier for the monster to eat you.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> is a 1-player roleplaying game for the TRS-80.</p>\n<p>Old legends speak of a large blue-white diamond hidden deep in the catacombs of Khazad 'Dum. Dozens of men have attempted to find this jewel, but none have ever returned. Your success will be based on your skill as a fighter and your ability to escape from its many traps.</p>\n<p>The player takes on the role of a fighter, and their skill is based upon their dexterity and strength. Dexterity expresses ability to hit, while strength is a measure of hit points. Armor class is determined by equipment worn. The player chooses from 7 different levels of weapons and 8 levels of armor. At the beginning of a game, the player chooses the character's name, god, and randomly roles the 3 stats and gold. A weapon can be purchased before entering the dungeon. The player starts with torches to keep the dungeon lit, and eleven cakes which can restore hit points. </p>\n<p>During combat, the player's dexterity determines if they can attack, and the player must choose which weapon to use. Weapons can break, leaving the player with only their fists which can also break, leaving a player unable to further fight. There are different available attacks, and the player can pray to their god if things looks drastic. </p>\n<p>The dungeon is explored via text commands, and the player can move north, south, east, or west. Each room is described via text, and they may contain random encounters which the player can try to avoid. Fixed monsters including a demon, a troll, a stone giant, a vampire, and a gargoyle provide special treasure. Also in the dungeon is a dragon, which holds the prized jewel, which can only be defeated with a magic lamp. If the player runs out of torches, they perish in the darkness.</p>",

The plane is displayed in 2 displays, the top of which shows local mountains and displays the plane's vertical location, and the bottom display which shows the plane's presence over the Earth. There are 5 levels of difficulty, which demonstrate different planes and wind conditions. The game is lost if the player crashes into the ground or flies outside of radar range.</p>",

The player must infiltrate a 9 x 9 grid castle, that is filled with gems, demons, flares, amulets, and an oracle. Also positioned throughout the castle are warp points that move the player about. The goal is to find the orb, which is disguised as a warp, which the player must directly teleport on top of to acquire. To teleport, the player must use the runestaff, which is disguised as a demon.</p>\n<p>The player moves throughout the castle by moving north, south, east, and west. The player has a map available of their locations, and can find lamps and flares to determine what is in nearby locations. When encountering demons, the player can either bribe them with gems, or can be made immune by the power of acquired amulets. Demons can also be killed with amulets. The player has limited time to find the Orb of Zot before the wizard arrives, and ends the game.</p>",

If you miss 3 animals, the game is over, although each 1000 points gets you an extra miss.

The player can get sick or injured during encounters, and require assistance from doctors at forts. The player can also purchase supplies at forts.

Gameplay is via menu structures, and players compete to maximize profit. Each turn, the player must purchase and refine oil for profit. They can purchase cheaper domestic or more expensive foreign oil, which they release to their refineries for profit. More domestic oil is available if the player purchases oil wells, and more refining capacity is available by purchasing and developing more refinery capacity.</p>\n<p>The player must ensure they purchase sufficient pollution control smog units, or risk receiving major fines from the EPA. Research can also be purchased to improve the efficiency of their refineries. </p>\n<p>To further improve company profit, excess cash can be used to purchase and sell a variety of stock each turn. The player can also spend extra money on domestic and foreign lobbying, as well as purchase class A and B service stations.</p>",

The specter of war again looms over the entire galaxy. The player takes on the role of Captain of the U.S.S.

These battlecruisers have already led to the loss of two Federation vessels and outposts. </p>\n<p>The player engages in combat with Klingon battlecruisers. Each turn, the distance and angle to the Klingon vessel and its shield level are displayed. The Enterprise's current energy level and shield power are also displayed. The player can choose to attack, using either their forward or read phasors, or fire a photon torpedo. Each of these actions deplete the vessel's energy reserves. The ship can veer off, close to attack, or stop in its current position to better position itself in combat, which affects damage rates. The player can also choose to enact repairs or charge shields.</p>\n<p>The goal is to destroy the enemy Klingon vessel before the Enterprise itself is destroyed.</p>",

Travelling faster will cause the plane to lose altitude more quickly. The player can adjust the direction and speed of their vessel.

The conflict has been reduced to a European land war. Most Allied commanders believe that victory is close at hand, but intelligence has confirmed that the enemy is massing their strongest combat divisions in an area approximately 100 kilometers north of Dresden in preparation for a slashing drive across Germany. You take on the role of general of the 5th Army Group, under command of NORPAC, to crush the enemy buildup.</p>\n<p>At the start of combat, the player is in control of 16 divisions, consisting of infantry, armored, and airborne. These can be placed in 4 corps, or in reserve. The player must rotate divisions between these 5 positions to push back the enemy charge. The enemy will randomly attack while repositioning troops, and sometimes your own division commanders will attack without orders. If the player's position is pushed back too far, it's game over.</p>",

The player uses this to bounce a space ball toward creatures which move laterally across the top of the screen. If the player misses a bounce, they lose a space ball, and it's game over when all are lost. The player gains bonus balls and additional rows of creatures as existing lines are defeated. As the game progresses, creatures and balls move faster.</p>",

Each tank has 6 movements points per round, which allows the player to input a combination of move, turn, delay, and fire. The headquarters can move 1 turn per round. The computer randomizes movement after all commands are placed. Each tank has a starting value for movement, range, shots, and armor, and as the tank takes damage, these factors decrease. When a tanks' armor falls below 1, it is destroyed. Rear shots cause more damage than broadside, which in turn cause more damage than frontal hits. Chance to hit is based upon distance to the enemy.</p>",

The peace treaty between the Terra and the Empire of Proxima Centauri has been broken, and the evil Proximans are preparing for a major attack on the Sol System. An advance party has already crossed the stellar void between the two systems, landed on Jupiter's moon Io, and captured a plutonium mine there. With the Io mine twelve re-fueling base in the hands of the Proximans, the comparatively miniscule Terran defense forces have little hope of preventing Earth and her sister planets from becoming another Proximan slave system. </p>\n<p>The Proximans have temporarily evacuated the mine, leaving behind only defensive robots. The player must guide a Mine Maintenance Robot specially outfitted for this mission with fusion grenades, and destroy the communication module on the lowest level. </p>\n<p>The goal on each level is to reach the exit to the next stage. The droid has limited energy, and firing a grenade or moving uses up this energy. Energy can be picked up throughout levels, and if the droid is depleted, it explodes. Random doors open and close, which can damage the player, as well the player must avoid mining lasers. Matter teleporters on each level can transport players to a different location. If the player touches an enemy robot, they are destroyed. The player starts with 4 vehicles, and it's game over if all are destroyed.</p>",

As the player descends, they can move left and right, and fire in 5 separate directions pointing downwards. The player can briefly operate a force field to protect them from enemies. The player has limited energy, that is used by shields and weapons, but slowly regenerates when not put to use. Enemies include mines, torpedoes, torpedo launchers, side movers, quick bombs, and mini mines. The goal is to reach the docking port at the bottom of the tunnel to destroy it. The ship is destroyed if it is hit.</p>",

You are the captain of a newly built intergalactic vessel, tasked with exploration and recolonization. The player's goal is to colonize and explore as many star systems as possible in the time time allotted. The player starts with a full stock of supplies and 5000 prospective colonists. As the player's fuel runs low, they can restock by mining radiation rich planets, but this takes away from exploration time. The player can also revisit previously established colonies to see how they are thriving, and restock supplies. The game ends when the player runs out of time, runs out of fuel, or successfully returns to Earth. </p>\n<p>The player can map, scan, jump, or check ship status each turn. While scanning, the player can look for nearby solar systems. The player can then jump to nearby star systems. When jumping, the player has a limited distance, and if they try to jump too far, they can become lost or destroyed. Scanning allows the player to determine the status of the currently visited system.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>X-Wing Fighter II</em> is a 1-player arcade game based upon the trench run from Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is divided into two unique sections. The player has a total 100 laser blasts and 4 torpedoes available. In the first section, the player must reach the trench of the Death Star. To do this, the player must use their lasers to destroy a number of enemy vessels based upon difficulty level. Gameplay is from a 1st person perspective, where the player must line up a crosshair with moving enemy vessels to destroy them. Enemies fire missiles towards the player, which they must dodge. One hit, and it's game over. The distance to the Death Star, as well as horizontal and vertical direction is displayed. As the player approaches the trench, they must direct their vessel towards 0,0, or they'll miss the trench.</p>\n<p>During trench descent, the player goes into auto-pilot, but must rapidly stabilize their craft when prompted, or they are destroyed.</p>\n<p>During the trench run, the player now combats 2 enemy vessels from the front, but must also dodge attacking vessels from the rear. A rear radar is displayed, and if an enemy craft aligns directly with the player, they are destroyed. Autopilot prevents destruction by running into the trench edge. </p>\n<p>Finally, as the player closes within 350 meters of the end of the trench, a special targeting sequence to launch a torpedo at the Death Star exhaust port commences.</p>",

The player advanced to the next round when all protroids are consumed. The neutroid speeds up as the round advances. Vertical and horizontal high energy regions briefly appear on the outer walls, and these supply a bonus if hit. On higher levels, bouncing antitroids can destroy a neutroid.

A miss will show the location of the shot relative to the location of the fighter. The player has 3 chances to hit and destroy the fighter and move on to the next fighter, or the fighter shoots back and the player is destroyed (and loses the game).</p>\n<p>After destroying 5-7 fighters, the player moves on to the Death Star bombing segment. This takes place in real time, with the player's plane shown moving across the screen, and the exhaust port being targeted displayed as well.

The planet is surrounded by a radiation dome, and flying above this dome leads to instant death via radiation poisoning.</p>\n<p>The \"taxi\" starts with 70 units of oxygen and 80 units of fuel. The action is turn-based. In each turn, the player decides how much fuel to use for horizontal thrust, and how much for vertical thrust. The ship then flies according to the thrust applied, with gravity also exerting a force. Each turn uses up 5 seconds of oxygen. If the player runs out of oxygen or crashes into the ground or the mountain, they also die.</p>",

At the start of the flight, the player decides how much fuel to carry vs. how many bombs. The bomber will automatically fly from left to right, and the player controls the bomber's altitude and decides when to launch bombs. While bombing the various targets, the player must avoid anti-aircraft guns. Eventually, the player can attempt to land the bomber in order to refuel. If the plane crashes, is shot down, or runs out of fuel, the game is over.</p>",

The action takes place in real-time and is shown from a side view. The player can move toward or away from the opponent, but can also move sideways right or left, which in practice is up or down on the screen, respectively. The player or the opponent gain points by hitting the other in the face. In practice, because of the way the animation works, the player must be slightly above the opponent (i.e. to the right of the opponent) to score a hit, and vice versa. The opponent will knock out the player if the opponent scores a few hits in succession without the player reacting. However, the opponent cannot be knocked out and the player can only win by decision. To do so, the player must both score a great deal of points and also score considerably more points than the opponent.</p>",

His name was Arthur. </p>\n<p>The list of British cities and the number of men available is displayed along with a map of England and Wales. Each turn the player can send a spy to several cities to determine how many troops are there. The player then rallies troops to an allied city for the campaigning season. The player has 2 turns, and can move their troops to cities near the rallied city to battle enemy troops and capture cities. The Anglo-Saxon forces can do the same each turn. The goal is to defeat the Anglo-Saxons, and drive them back into the sea.</p>",

The player character is attempting to fall down a seemingly endless vertical shaft in a controlled fashion, while collecting as many gems as possible. The screen continually scrolls vertically. The player character cannot jump, but can walk off a platform and control their descent, and attempt to land on a platform below. If the player character goes offscreen, they die.\nThe platform structures and gem positions in Gem Hunter are randomized with every game providing an element of luck and variety making each game a bit different.</p>",

Set during the gold rush era of US history the player reenacts the record breaking voyages of the historical ships The Flying Cloud, The Surprise and The Challenge. Picking one of the ships the player must race the other two to San Francisco. </p>\n<p>The game shows the map of the Americas and the position of the three ships. Each turn the player must pick a direction to sail in, getting information about the wind (including a visual of the staysail). When close to the coast the player can also spot land which must obviously be avoided. The ship can also run aground on hidden reefs. Aside from the player-chosen direction, the ship's heading is also influenced by the currents in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and winds blowing the ship off course.</p>",

During a turn the player can either guess the hidden card (ending the game) or play by calling out a card. When a card is called out the other player must show it or say respond with \"no\".

        "description": "<p>A couple of strolling friends are intercepted by an unknown person outside a television studio. After a short exchange of words, the person ushers the pair into the studio, since as it turns out they have just been picked to participate in a live music quiz show.\n<em>Name That Song</em> is a music quiz game that emulates the format and presentation of a live TV show. Two human players pit their music knowledge against each other, while the computer impersonates the host.\nThe game consists of three rounds with slightly different rules, where the computer plays random songs which players attempt to identify by listening to and to name the title, if they actually know it. Each correct answer adds to the individual contestant's score and at the end of the third round the grand winner is announced.\nEach player has a buzzer assigned to a specific key on the keyboard and the interface accepts text input for player's answers. A limited amount of flashy, animated graphics is used, but of course the game relies almost entirely on the musical notes the hardware puts out. \nThe game has a number of tunes stored on disk and also includes a separate editor that lets users compose and save their own to incorporate in the game.</p>",

Character attributes include intelligence, wisdom, intuition, ego, piety, courage, strength, agility, dexterity, luck, and vitality.  Character classes include fighter, warrior, bowman, archer, cleric, priest, mage, sorcerer, wizard, necromancer, thief, or warlock. The player can purchase supplies and equipment from the Armory at the Warriors' Inn, and can heal wounds and regain spells here.  </p>\n<p>The castle is explored from a 3D perspective, and the player can move left, right, or forwards.  The player can camp, where they can wait to be rescued by other parties or trade equipment or equip a character.  During encounters the player can cast mage, cleric, or necromancer spells.</p>",
