As an early version of computerized chess, the game does not feature a graphical depiction of the board nor the pieces. Instead, the player is expected to use their own physical board to supplement the gameplay and submit their moves (e.g. E2 - E4) into the game program.</p>\n<p>Both one- and two-player modes are supported, along with six available levels of intelligence for the AI opponent. The game also features the ability to replay the log of a previously completed game in forward or reverse order. In an interesting twist, the option to disable the rules governing piece movement is available, allowing the player to move a piece anywhere on the board.</p>\n<p>A sequel <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/137528/cassette-22-chess-ii/\">Chess II</a> was later released.</p>",

Variant one has a cross-hair in the center of the screen that is used to fire at enemy space ships. Using the controller the player can line them up. Ships that aren't shot will ram the player and reduce points. Variant two is for two players where both players must coordinate to dock a spaceship on a space station. One player controls the ship, the other the station. The third variant has one player attacking the other from the left side of the screen. The other must dodge the laser fire. The fourth variant again places one player in the role of a combatant and the other making defensive maneuvers, but this time the combatant uses the first person targeting from variant one. All games last 99 seconds and are about scoring the most points. Additionally, each game has two speed variants.</p>",

The game does not feature a graphical depiction of the board nor the pieces. Instead, the player is expected to use their own physical board to supplement the gameplay and submit their moves (e.g. E2 - E4) into the game program.</p>\n<p>Both one- and two-player modes are supported, along with nine available levels of intelligence for the AI opponent (up from six from the original) and the ability to ask the computer for advice on the next move. The game also features the ability to replay the log of a previously completed game in forward or reverse order. In an interesting twist, the option to disable the rules governing piece movement is available, allowing the player to move a piece anywhere on the board.</p>",

The cowboys cannot shoot while moving, instead, they must enter a firing position after which the joystick is used to aim the gun rather than walk. After a shot, the player cannot exit the firing position until the bullet has hit something. A stagecoach and a cactus offer cover for the players. Different game variations offer different game rules such as the cover being breakable, being able to get up immediately after shooting or having a bullet limit. All game variants can also be played in a target practice mode where there is no second player present.</p>",

Players roll dice to move men over the game board with the aim of being the first to move all fifteen off of the board. The typical rules of Backgammon apply. Players roll two dice (if a pair is rolled it becomes four for that turn with the extra two being a copy of the original pair) to move their pieces to an empty slot, a slot occupied by their own pieces, or a slot that contains only one of their opponent's pieces. Doing that will send their opponent's piece back to their own home base. The game can be played against the computer or against another player.</p>",

Players fire guided missiles which must be led to the alien UFO. The UFO releases a landing craft that will try to construct a platform for the UFO to land on, which ends the game. The player must shoot down the landing crafts to prevent the platform from being constructed. The UFO also becomes vulnerable at times. Hitting it while it is vulnerable will cause part of the platform to be destroyed again. The UFO can also try to dodge the incoming missiles and go into hyperspace, where it is invisible. Hitting the invisible UFO actually damages it and can destroy it after which a new UFO will appear. There are multiple game variations and it can be played solo or with two players playing at the same time and competing for the highest score.</p>",

There are nine sectors in which the mothership can be located and players can use an overview map to find out where it currently is and where enemies can still be found.

The player controls a spacecraft and can fly either left or right in a scrolling environment. Zylon spacecraft need to be shot down and energy stations defended. Indicators at the bottom of the screen show which energy station is currently under attack. When taking damage from enemy projectiles the ship's shields will deplete. Shields can be recharged in special stations. While recharging the player can fire homing missiles. When playing with two players one of the players controls the Zylons.</p>",
