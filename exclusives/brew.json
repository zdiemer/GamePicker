Press the # key at any time to bring up the Pause Menu for help topics. Press the * key for settings in the Options menu. Gameplay in each round proceeds as follows: blinds are placed at the start of each game; two cards are dealt to each player face down; players may call, raise or fold; three community cards (useable by all players) are dealt face up in the middle of the table (The Flop); a second betting round takes place; a fourth community card is dealt face up (The Turn); a third betting round takes place; a fifth and final community card is dealt face up (The River); the final betting round takes place; and, finally, remaining players compare hands to determine the winner for that round.</p>\n<p>The game also includes SMS options for playing a trivia game, receiving poker tips, and getting news about the actual NHPC event on your mobile phone.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Jail break in progress! A slew of convicts have escaped from prison, and its your job to round them all up and return them to jail as fast as you can. Along with your trusty deputy, you navigate each of the 28 challenging levels, grabbing power-ups, avoiding treacherous terrain, and dodging speeding cars while you track down prisoners around the world. Chase felons through training grounds, forest mazes, rocky deserts, grassy suburbs, interstates with heavy traffic, island scenes, and mountain terrain. </p>\n<p><em>Jail Trail</em> is a unique 2-D top-down action game specifically designed for easy control on cell phones. Loosely based on the extremely popular \"Snake\" cell phone game, the lead cop and his deputy constantly moving, and you use the the arrow buttons to turn head of the \"trail\" or \"chain\", tracking down the fleeing convicts. When you catch up to an escaped felon running from the cops, he is cuffed and attached to the end of the chain. All deputies and convicts attached to the chain will follow the lead cop, and you have to make sure you don't run into any of the varied obstacles or any of the felons in the chain itself. If you hit an obstacle or the chain, you'll be stunned for a few seconds and some of the convicts will escape and you'll have to track them down again. </p>\n<p>There are different types of convicts, each with their own unique abilities and AI, and the game includes many power-ups such as \"Freeze All\", \"Invincibility\", \"Stun Gun\", and even bonus point \"Donuts\". You can unlock new levels as you advance through the game and can start a new game from any unlocked level, so you don't need to start from the beginning every time. The game also saves high scores, best times for each level, unlocked levels, and one saved game.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In this mobile puzzle/action game, players are tasked with matching colored blocks together to form bigger clusters. Once linked, clusters can be destroyed using a diamond piece that will randomly appear. If players can bring down their tower of colored gems before time runs out, they win. In addition to the single-player modes (Classic, Action, Puzzle), players can also play against opponents in real-time, in an online multiplayer mode. Once again tasked with clearing stacks of colored bocks by dropping diamonds, players race against their online opponent to clutter the opposing screen with the blocks that they have cleared. If a player's screen screen fills up to the top with gems, the match is over.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>BioShock</em> for mobile phones was released in two versions. First a 2D top down game and then this 3D first person adaptation for more advanced phones.</p>\n<p>The year is 1960 and the player character, Jack, is on board a plane crossing the Atlantic ocean. Things go wrong though and the plane crashes. Jack is lucky though and finds himself outside a lighthouse. This is no ordinary lighthouse however. It leads to Rapture, an Utopian underwater city built by the tycoon Andrew Ryan. It's not long until Jack is contacted by a man called Atlas who offers Jack his support. </p>\n<p>Gameplay remains the same as the original 2K shooter. Not only does it tell the same story, it also comes with many of its gameplay mechanics. Like in any other shooter the player can use numerous weapons, both melee and ranged. In BioShock the player also has access to plasmids which are special powers like electric bolts and fireballs. Rapture is full of splicers, insane people damaged by severe use of plasmids. These are the most common enemies in the game and comes in different shapes such as thuggish splicers that use melee weapons and leadhead splicers that are armed.</p>\n<p>The player will also come across Big Daddies and Little Sisters. The sisters role in Rapture is to collect ADAM from corpses. ADAM is needed by the player to buy new plasmids. To get ADAM the player needs to gather it from a sister. This is not so easy since each sister is protected by a big daddy which has to be defeated in battle. Once the big daddy is defeated the player can choose to either kill the sister and get a large amount of ADAM or save her to get a smaller amount. For every three saved sisters the player will get a gift as compensation. </p>\n<p>This version does however only feature the first four levels of the original game, namely: Welcome to Rapture, Medical Pavilion, Neptune\u2019s Bounty and Smuggler\u2019s Hideout. It features five weapons from the original: the wrench, the pistol, the machine gun, the shotgun and the grenade launcher.</p>",

Regarding gameplay it is however adapted to the limited hardware capabilites: featuring simpler 3D graphics, no free-roaming, and completely different racing modes.</p>\n<p>Playing as a newbie street racer in Rockport City, the player's goal is to move up the so-called Blacklist, a ranking of the street racing elite. Three different types of races are available: Outrun races pit the player against the clock and against a phalanx of police vehicles giving chase. In Speed Camera races, the goal is to hit speed camera positions on the track with maximum speed, with the average speed having to be higher than a set goal necessary to win. Finally, Boss Outrun races are duels against the Blacklist drivers, with the player gaining the opponent's car upon winning. There are sixteen cars in the game in total. Completing races as well as driving dangerously earns money which can be spent to upgrade the cars.</p>\n<p>A lot of the game content like videos and music tracks is optional and only streamed to the phone via the VCast service if necessary.
