        "description": "<p><em>Steel Diver</em> is a launch title accompanying Nintendo's 3DS system to the market, and a fresh IP from Nintendo for the new system. <em>Steel Diver</em> is a title built around submarine action and combat.</p>\n<p><strong>Campaign</strong></p>\n<p>Despite the system's highly touted 3-D capabilities, <em>Steel Diver</em> actually plays in a side-scrolling perspective and in a 2-D plane, where the bulk of the depth is simply in background graphics. Players control a submarine navigating underwater environments and a variety of hostile elements, including mines, enemy submarines, and various rocky obstacles. Control is performed entirely through the touch-screen. Players utilize horizontal and vertical sliders to move the sub forward horizontally and vertically in the water, and tilt a wheel to change the angle of the submarine. The further the sliders are moved, the faster the speed. Torpedoes and repairs, as well as adjusting the map screen are also used simply by tapping the appropriate points on the bottom screen. Action isn't necessarily fast-paced, and players must learn to monitor and correct the movement of the submarine as it may continue to \"drift\" in the water. Three different submarines are available at the start of each mission with different sizes and attributes, from small and fast to large and tough.</p>\n<p><strong>Periscope Strike</strong></p>\n<p>Besides the regular campaign mode, played through the 2-D side scrolling environments, there is also a more 3-D style periscope mini-game segment. All control is again performed through the touch-screen, with an option to rotate the view of the periscope by physically moving the 3DS system (and yourself in the process). As this view is seen as if through a periscope, it takes on a first-person orientation. Here, players again have the ability to dive and repair leaks, but must use some strategy to launch torpedoes at constantly moving distant ships. </p>\n<p><strong>Steel Commander</strong></p>\n<p>This segment is a one or two-player turn-based strategy game played through an overhead hexagonal map, rather like the <em>Battleship</em> tabletop game. Like <em>Battleship</em>, enemy ships aren't initially visible and must be discovered to be attacked. Rather than launching relatively random attacks, enemy ships are discovered by moving near them or using sonar. This game features three types of ships: Submarines, escorts, and supply ships. Only submarines can enter enemy territory, and of course, the game ends when one player has all their ships destroyed. Supply ships cannot attack. Movement and controls are again performed through the touch-screen (which shows the hexagonal grid). The top (3-D) screen shows the action of the battle. </p>\n<p><strong>Other Features</strong>\n<em>Steel Diver</em> features download play, meaning that two-player gameplay can be done with one game card (but two systems). \"Ghosts\" may also appear in the game as a competitive element representing the player's previous \"best time\" for a stage or mission.</p>",

        "description": "<p>As Ubisoft did with the Wii, they've jumped on board with the 3DS with several titles, and no fewer than two of them are Tom Clancy franchises. One of those Tom Clancy games is <em>Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars</em>, and it lands on the 3DS, in a sense, filling the launch-window vacancy of two very similar Nintendo franchises: <em>Fire Emblem</em> and <em>Advance Wars</em>. In that regard, <em>Shadow Wars</em> is played from an overhead perspective using a grid-style system to organize units in a turn-based strategy game.</p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong>\n<em>Shadow Wars</em> involves a behind-the-scenes plot by \"ultranationalist\" conspirators to revert Russia back to the days of the Iron Curtain, Communism, and the Cold War. A large part of the plot involves the Russian conspirators meddling in the affairs of neighboring countries, wherein the Ghost Recon team is dispatched to clear things up. There are six characters acting as individual units similar to Nintendo's own <em>Fire Emblem</em> series, each with special abilities. The six classes are Commando, Gunner, Sniper, Recon, Engineer, and Medic. Players must learn to use each strategically to survive missions. Missions also tend to have multiple objectives, and difficulties may be selected prior to engaging each stage.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>The game is viewed from an overhead perspective (top screen, with 3-D depth), with limited camera adjustments available using the analog nub. The game is largely controlled with the d-pad and buttons. The bottom screen is used for stats and only a few segments of the game use it--mostly for players to reference detailed information in some elements in the game, such as weapon attributes. As in <em>Fire Emblem</em> or <em>Advance Wars</em>, lightly colored squares appear over the stages indicating available player movement, attack points, and other details. Characters have limited health and ammo, but each carries two weapons or items. </p>\n<p><strong>Other Features</strong></p>\n<p>Besides the regular campaign (story mode), there is a Skirmish mode, which features stand-alone missions against the computer. Like the regular game, players can choose from one of the three difficulty levels. Players also earn points (known as PEC points) and stars from accomplishing mission objectives, and at higher difficulty settings. The PEC points are used to increase the \"rank\" of the player (and track progress) and stars can be spent after missions to upgrade various attributes of the characters, such as health. There is also a multiplayer mode that can be played using a single 3DS system, possible as the game is turn-based strategy.</p>",

In Archery, the player is presented with targets which they must shoot at by moving the 3DS to aim. AR Shot involves shooting a ball into a hole in one shot via increasingly elaborate routes constructed by manipulation of the flat surface which the card is placed on. Fishing turns the surface into a lake with fish, which the player can catch by moving their console to simulate a fishing rod.</p>\n<p><em>Face Raiders</em> makes extensive use of the 3DS cameras, and as the title suggests, involves getting players to photograph themselves and friends and family for the game. Once the face is carefully lined up with an on-screen guide and photographed, the game attempts to identify the sex of the individual and whether or not they're an adult or child. After this, the face is given some 3-D modelling, and planted onto helmeted faces for use in the game. The game is largely played as a sort of \"augmented reality rail shooter.\" Players aim by moving the console, which is detected by the gyroscope and the rear-facing cameras, and shoot yellow balls at the faces flying at them in the screen. In this sense, gameplay takes place where ever the player currently resides, they'll be shooting at faces flying at them from surrealistic holes broken through the background of the real-life environment seen by the cameras. A player may see holes broken through their television and living room furniture with outer space \"visible\" through the holes. Faces will attack, launch weapons, and occasionally, broken pieces of the background will even fly towards the player. Boss characters (or faces) will also appear, which may require more tact than simple, direct shooting. The game also features a \"face collection\" section where players can view the faces they've photographed. Players are encouraged to take pictures of more faces and people in order to unlock more stages. </p>\n<p><em>Find Mii/StreetPass Quest</em> is a role-playing game wherein the players party consists of a selection of Miis they have collected through the StreetPass feature. In each room, the Miis must fight ghosts in turn-based battles in order to progress to the final room where another Mii is held prisoner. A Mii can attack with either a weapon or magic spell, defined by their favourite colour. The Miis do battle one at a time and in an order, so that if one Mii is defeated, the next in order will take their place.</p>\n<p>In addition, there are a selection of jigsaw puzzles with missing pieces which the player can obtain either by encountering another player via StreetPass who has the piece or by purchasing it with the coins they attained by walking while carrying their Nintendo 3DS system.</p>",

It uses the Mii character the user has created in the Mii Maker on the Nintendo 3DS. The player can explore the island, initially by plane, hang glider and rocket belt with other aircraft unlocked later in the game, in either Free Flight Mode or Mission Mode. Each vehicle has its own unique controls and offers unique challenges</p>\n<p>In Free Flight Mode, the player can visit unique landmarks and collect diorama's of planes and monuments or balloons and stunt rings. The more items are collected, the more time the player is given to explore, gradually increasing the range of the island that is available.\nIn Mission Mode, the player earns stars for completing goals such as flying through hoops, landing the aircraft in an exact spot or shooting targets. The better the player meets the parameters, the more stars are earned, up to three stars per mission. The stars add up towards a new rank, starting with Training, then Bronze, Silver, Gold and finally Platinum</p>\n<p>It is possible to take in-game photos and save them to the 3DS photo album so they can be viewed outside the game and shared with others. \nIt was a launch title in all regions except Japan and Oceania.

        "description": "<p><em>Dream Trigger 3D</em> is not an easy game to define. It's one part shmup and one part puzzle game, with a dash of rhythm thrown in for good measure. If that doesn't sound strange enough, the concept behind the game goes even further: Players are tasked with delving into the bleakest depths of their consciousness in order to battle and defeat nightmares. Essentially, players are \"dream fixers.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong>\n<em>Dream Trigger's</em> complex shmup-based gameplay focuses on a concept of sonar pings. The bottom (touch) screen of the 3DS features a grid that players tap with the stylus to position sonar pings. A rhythmic sonar wipe moves across the screen, and where ever the player tapped the screen, a sonar signal is activated. This is necessary because all enemies are generally invisible, and cannot be attacked unless a sonar signal makes them visible. Careful planning, and a strict attention to detail are necessary to lay pings in anticipation of enemy movements, and in order to constantly move the player character out of the way of enemy attacks. </p>\n<p>Successfully pinging enemies fills an attack meter to give players ammunition. Attacking is performed using any of several different buttons on the 3DS, including the L &amp; R buttons, but can also be done tapping the edges of the touch screen. Players must reveal enemies by pinging them, then attacking and defeating them quickly by holding down an attack button and moving the player character (also acting as a cursor) over enemies. While attacking, the weapon meter quickly depletes, but the player is invincible from enemy shots during this time. The player character/cursor is moved using the analog nub, D-pad, or ABXY buttons for left-handed mode.</p>\n<p>The quirky, unusual gameplay style and graphical presentation mirror aspects of puzzle/shooter titles from companies like Q? Entertainment, Taito, and Treasure. <em>Dream Trigger</em> bears resemblances to titles such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/32340/e4-every-extend-extra-extreme/\">Every Extend Extra Extreme</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/18303/meteos/\">Meteos</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Space+Invaders+Extreme\">Space Invaders Extreme</a>. </p>\n<p><em>Dream Trigger</em> boasts over fifty standard stages with over a hundred bonus challenges. The Challenges are conditional achievements players may accomplish during regular gameplay. Finishing stages, defeating bosses (each stage has a boss character), or accomplishing Challenges earns players Dream Points which are, in turn, used to unlock and move to new stages in the World Map gameplay mode. Challenges range from collecting all health items in a stage to completing a boss battle without taking damage to unlocking a new route through the map. The game also keeps track of how closely players get to accomplishing some Challenges if they haven't yet completed them.</p>\n<p><strong>Modes</strong></p>\n<p>The basic gameplay mode is \"World Map Mode\" which starts with a couple stages and gradually opens up as players complete and advance through new areas. The map screen is a system of branching lines connecting the stages, and Dream Points are spent advancing to new areas. Through this mode, new stages are unlocked for use in other modes.</p>\n<p>There are also Free Play and Time Attack modes, which play exactly as they appear. The former is to play any unlocked stage freely for a point total to add to the player's personal scoreboard, and the latter challenges players in a similar fashion, but rate time limits rather than score. There is also a local wireless versus mode for two players with two Nintendo 3DS systems.</p>",

The game has undergone some major changes. The graphics update and the addition of 3D effects is the biggest one. The touchscreen is now used to replace the old menu which required the player to push the start button, now the player can simply select an item by touching it on the screen. There is also gyroscopic technology which allows the player to aim by moving the system, this makes it easier to use weapons like boomerangs and slingshots. The game also contains the Master Quest version and a new \"boss challenge\" mode. For the newcomers, there is also a feature called \"visions\" that show the player how to complete certain tasks.</p>\n<p>Story-wise the game has remained the same: Link is a young boy who lives in the Kokiri Forest but is one day called to arms by the Deku Tree who tells him to leave the forest and find Princess Zelda. Link is told that he must stop the evil Ganondorf from taking over Hyrule. The game still has the same puzzles and the only change is that the Stone of Agony has been replaced by a \"Shard of Agony\" which does the same thing. The Master Quest is a version of the game with a mirrored world, new puzzles, and stronger enemies, but was already released on the Nintendo Gamecube.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D</em> is not a typical <em>Resident Evil</em> title. It handily shrugs off the horror atmosphere of past titles for horror-themed action and combat. <em>The Mercenaries 3D</em> is essentially a full game version of the now classic Mercenaries mode found in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/52872/resident-evil-4/\">Resident Evil 4</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/40967/resident-evil-5/\">Resident Evil 5</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p><em>The Mercenaries 3</em> plays almost exactly like the Mercenaries modes of it's console brethren. It is an action-oriented title where players can choose any of eight playable characters to shoot, explode, and melee their way through swarms of marauding enemies. The game is viewed from the over-the-shoulder style of <em>Resident Evil 4</em> and <em>Resident Evil 5</em>, switching to a zoomed view when targeting enemies. The zoomed view can be played in either third or first-person. </p>\n<p>The gameplay is straightforward and simple: Kill as many enemies as possible within a time limit, or kill a required number of enemies before time runs out. Stages have individual settings, such as all being done in a set time limit, having a time limit that can be extended, defeating waves of enemies, or defeating a boss character. All enemies and stages are taken from and inspired by  <em>Resident Evil 4</em> and <em>5</em>. There are thirty individual missions in all.</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<p>The game features a variety of features to add some depth to the original experience. Most notable is the wide variety of Skills that can be applied to each character and upgraded. Each character can carry up to three different skills at one time, and they gain experience and improve as the game is played with them equipped. Skills such as being resistant to death, reloading guns faster, better use of medical supplies, and the like are peppered throughout the game. These are unlocked by playing through the regular game and accomplishing various tasks, such as building combos with kills.</p>\n<p>There are also a wide variety of medals that can be earned through the game for completing various tasks. There are fifty medals that can be earned which range from simple \"Clear all Missions for Level 1\" to more challenge-focused elements like \"Kill 3 enemies with 1 hand grenade\" or \"Clear a mission without ever missing a shot.\"</p>\n<p>There is a level of weapon customization and there are alternate costumes for all the usable characters as well. <em>Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D</em> is also playable in co-op both online and in local play.</p>\n<p><strong>Resident Evil: Revelations</strong></p>\n<p>Arguably the biggest added feature to the game is that is comes with a playable demo of the next main-line game for the <em>Resident Evil</em> series, which is called <em>Resident Evil: Revelations</em> and is geared towards the classic survival horror style of the franchise. The demo is brief, but intended to give players an idea that Capcom is interested in successfully combining the survival horror aspects of the original games with the refined gameplay from modern titles. The demo lasts for about 5 - 10 minutes depending on the player.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Professor Layton and Luke head to the town of miracles, Montdol, in search of the Mask of Miracle. The mask has the ability to grant wishes to its wearer. Layton and Luke arrive at the town to see they are too late, as a mysterious man is using the power of the mask to turn people to stone. Layton and Luke task themselves with solving the mystery of Montdol and the Mask of Miracles.</p>\n<p>This fifth game in the <em>Professor Layton</em> series makes more use of the physical button controls for puzzle-solving as opposed to just the touchscreen. To take advantage of the hardware capabilities of the Nintendo 3DS, the characters are rendered in polygons outside of cutscenes, as opposed to sprites, in addition to other polishings of the interface.</p>\n<p>Beside the regular adventure where you traverse the town, talk to the characters and solve puzzles, there are several mini-games that get gradually unlocked as you play and find the unlockable items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bunny - after a while, you will stumble upon a circus bunny that isn't performing well and decide to help it along. This will require constant training of new moves which will become available over time as you acquire them. After you teach the bunny new moves, you will be able to instruct it to use those moves during the theatrical performances. Theatrical performances consist of a director telling you what the story is about and what he wants to see in each scene, and you will have to instruct bunny to act accordingly, providing you have taught it the moves necessary to perform the full play.</li>\n<li>Robot - after you acquire a toy robot from one of the street vendors, you will be able to play levels that will become gradually available. Levels are rectangular in shape and you can move your robot left, right, up or down through the field of squares. Each movement uses some of the battery and you have to reach the end square before the battery depletes which still gives you a lot of time for trial and error. Single movement will move your robot by three steps unless it bumps into a wall or picks up some special items that may temporarily boost its power to eat through the wall and enemies that move in pre-defined patterns.</li>\n<li>Shop - helping the friend in need, as a true gentleman, this mini-game will let you order the items in the store so that when customer comes to buy what he or she wants, the rest of the items also catch his/her eye and in turn you end up selling all your wares. Base item is initially set in the store, and you can place other items only adjacent to already placed items in the store. What will catch the eye of the customer after purchasing some item is the adjacent item that is either of the same type or of the same color. Placing two similar items might confuse the customer due to ambiguity which may lead the customer to stop buying after a while if the net remaining adjacent item has no connection to the last item he or she purchased.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Beside mini-games there are many collectible items you can find during your exploration and some of the flashback sub-stories become available after certain key events which can then be watched as short episodes where characters vary from event to event, and might not even be one of the leading three characters.</p>",

When he is attacked, he will lose his current power-up or shrink down to a small size if he hasn't already, in which case he will lose a life and must retry the level. If this happens multiple times, the player can activate the White Tanooki suit to grant Mario invincibility for that level.</p>\n<p>He can grow back to normal size again by collecting a mushroom. Some of the power-ups Mario can use to aid him include the Tanooki suit, which allows him to hover in the air while jumping and use a spinning attack, and the Flower Suit, which allows him once again to shoot fireballs in the direction he is facing.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Shinobi</em> is not necessarily a sequel nor a remake. At it's core, it's an infusion of modern technology, control and design styles combined with the classic gameplay, style, and ideals of classic Genesis-era <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7730/the-revenge-of-shinobi/\">Shinobi</a> games. <em>Shinobi</em> for the 3DS it is a side-scrolling action game where the 3-D depth and visuals are used to layer challenges such as traps and enemy attacks. The gameplay world is modeled in 3D and the style is that of a modern 2.5D game. As such, when the player is moving through areas, the levels will rotate in 3-D along paths, but gameplay will remain in a 2-D plane.</p>\n<p>Taking control of Jiro Musashi, players must utilize quick reflexes and careful planning to fight, slash, jump, and climb their way through levels. Like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8073/shinobi-iii-return-of-the-ninja-master/\">Shinobi III</a> on the Genesis/Mega-Drive, Jiro has a double jump, from which a down-ward katana strike may be launched, or where Jiro may throw a swath shuriken outward in a circle covering a large area of the stage. Jiro also comes equipped with wall-jumping abilities which, in classic gaming fashion, tend to be put to the test in areas with pointy surfaces. Up to five shuriken may be thrown in quick succession, after which there is a brief waiting period where Jiro \"readies\" five more shuriken. Players also have the ability to block or parry attacks from enemies, and utilizing this skill becomes highly important to regular gameplay, and learning to use it becomes a necessity to survive some enemy and boss encounters. The block only activates for about half a second, so holding down the block button does not initiate continual blocking as in games such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/51243/mortal-kombat/\">Mortal Kombat</a>. It's designed as a test of reflexes and skills. Like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Contra+4\">Contra 4</a>, Jiro also has a grapple hook that can be fired upwards to reach and cling to high places, and also like <em>Contra 4</em>, the game is steeped in classic platforming and movement challenges, including reflex-testing jumps to small platforms (like the notorious falling-rock jumping sequence from <em>Shinobi III</em>), and navigation through areas where Jiro must cling to the ceiling, ropes, or other structures to navigate tricky areas. Also returning from past <em>Shinobi</em> games is the Ninja magic, which can be selected on the touch-screen and activated with the L button. Finally, as if all this wasn't enough, there are stealth-kill events where the player may walk up to an enemy who's back is turned and press the X button to activate a quick kill. This also comes into play during boss battles where a devastating attack from behind may be performed on a temporarily stunned boss.</p>\n<p>With all these abilities, the game is designed to be extremely physically challenging in combat and movement, and intended to be rewarding when performed well. <em>Shinobi</em> has a complex points and score system, involving combos and deflected attacks. A consequence of this score system is that points are lost when Jiro takes damage. Players can test their skills later and try for personal higher scores in Free Play mode on completed stages. High scores, fastest times and a letter grade are all recorded upon completion of a stage.</p>\n<p><em>Shinobi's</em> StreetPass functionality is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/53511/super-mario-3d-land/\">Super Mario 3D Land</a>, where challenge stages may be purchased with Play Coins or unlocked if communication occurs with another 3DS system with <em>Shinobi</em> content. Street Pass Challenges are small \"virtual reality\" style stages where the idea is to complete the challenge quickly and without taking damage. Despite the visible life bar, the stage ends if Jiro is hit even once.</p>\n<p>There is a vast collection of extras in the game, including Achievements and Awards. Achievements work like typical Xbox 360-style Achievements chronicling progress, successes like defeating a boss quickly, and the occasional blunder such as being killed for the first time by an environmental object. A wide variety of cheats are also unlocked through gameplay that may be used in Freeplay mode. These include things like activating automatic parrying, infinite magic use, or different weapons, like a sword from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/199/golden-axe/\">Golden Axe</a>. There is also a Dojo to practice moves and abilities. A large Awards section allows players to listen to music tracks, movies, and concept art unlocked through gameplay. Another feature that will remind players of <em>Contra 4</em> is the History section. Like the Museum in that title, this serves as a detailed history of the Shinobi franchise with synopses and facts about each game in the series' long history. </p>\n<p>The story is fairly straightforward tale of betrayal, with a smattering of animated cutscenes between levels to tell the story. As noted, the star of this ninja adventure is Jiro Musashi, who is the father of Joe Musashi, the star of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1884/shinobi/\">Shinobi</a> games. What's important is the hectic ninja action, emphasis on skills and reflexes... and at least one boss fight of ninja versus helicopter!</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Cubic Ninja</em> is an action-puzzle game designed less with 3-D in mind, and more emphasizing the tilt-control abilities of the 3DS. Like the ninja-themed puzzler <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/36436/n/\">n+</a>, <em>Cubic Ninja</em> features a large number of relatively small stages where the challenge comes from working out the manner to proceed through the stage to an exit. Rather than quick platforming-based gameplay focused on stamina and reflexes with buttons, <em>Cubic Ninja</em> challenges the player's ability to tilt the 3DS physically in every conceivable direction to drop the block of ninja through traps, tunnels, and dangers a plenty. Whereas <em>n+</em> is strictly timed, <em>Cubic Ninja</em> is not, but challenges players to complete stages as quickly as possible, recording the best times.</p>\n<p>The story is about CC, the titular cube-shaped ninja who takes charge to save a princess from \"lab-coated bandits.\" The game's focus has CC working his way through the bandit hideout, the location of which was discovered by CC using the Internet. The bandit hideout is, of course, awash in unfriendly things like explosives, traps, spikes, flamethrowers, and rest rooms. Rest rooms may actually tend to be friendly, providing special power-ups, but over use of the rest rooms may have less rewarding consequences. The game also features boss battles, which must be \"fought\" in a similar manner as the rest of the puzzles in the game, with tilting the 3DS to cause harm to boss characters. </p>\n<p>No modern self-respecting ninja comes without some kind of special skills, and despite being small black block, CC is no different. Hidden and scattered through each level are ninja scrolls which are collected to be able to use Ninjutsu skills. Shrinking makes CC smaller and easier to maneuver through tight areas. Switch automatically activates all switches in a level. The Star skill makes the ninja shoot stars in all directions. The Shield, as might be obvious, gives CC a protective shield allowing him to resister a number of hits before dying, as opposed to dying with a single hit, which is how the game plays normally. Besides this, if a player dies five times in a row in the same level, they're given an opportunity to have as many scrolls as possible--but the stats show a white flag after finishing the level, showing that the stage was completed with help. </p>\n<p>The game also features the option to play with the Circle Pad and 3-D turned on if players so choose. The 3-D option is deactivated during tilt gameplay as it would be impossible to maintain while tilting the system in so many different directions. With the Circle Pad option turned on, the player moves into the foreground with the X button. The game features Time Attack and Survival modes, as well as Medals awarded through various challenges in the game, using various unlocked usable characters. There is also a level creator, and new pieces for the creator are unlocked as the player progresses through the main game. These stages can be shared with QR codes, as each created stage will have one, and players need only photograph a code to import the created level. Stages and Time Attack ghosts can both be shared with the QR codes.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy</em> is a flight-sim / arcade fighter combat action game. The game is typically played in a 3rd-Person, behind the aircraft, or 1st-Person, inside the cockpit view. It features series mainstays such as numerous selectable aircraft and the ability to purchase parts and weapons to customize the fighters. Where <em>Assault Horizon Legacy</em> sets itself apart from current console versions of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/57326/ace-combat-assault-horizon/\">Assault Horizon</a> in that the gameplay is tipped more in favor of the arcade-style action of the early games in the series rather than focusing on flight-sim characteristics. Also different from the console versions of Assault Horizon is that this entry takes place in the fictional universe of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6574/ace-combat-2/\">older games</a> in the series, rather than real-world locations.</p>\n<p>The story concerns a rebel coup during a pinnacle treaty signing where the player takes the role of Phoenix in Scarface Squadron and must quell the uprising in a series of aerial, air-to-ground, and air-to-sea battles along with escort missions. The game takes place in the same fictional world as previous entries concerning the Osean Federation, the Union of Yuktobanian Republics, and the Federal Republic of Erusea. Aircraft in the game are both real, officially licensed planes, and fictional, and can be purchased and upgraded through progression of the story mode. The game features voice acting in every area including dialog during combat, mission briefings, and story cutscenes. As the story progresses and more planes are purchased, players must use strategic thinking in selecting their aircraft and weapons, perhaps choosing to sacrifice armor for mobility, mobility for speed, long-range missiles over air-to-ground missiles, and the like.</p>\n<p>The scaled-back arcade-style gameplay has been designed to be friendly to the quick on-the-go gaming of the portable 3DS system. As such, maneuvering is intended to be quick and levels may only last for a few minutes. Players use the analog nub to move the aircraft, with the L and R buttons used for braking and accelerating respectively. Brief, sharp turns and cornering are performed using both buttons and steering with the analog nub. Rather than having to hone flight skills to dodge enemy attacks as seen in the console versions, here, players are given cues to dodge attacks and instantly correct flight angles to follow enemy planes. When nearing an enemy fighter, the Maneuver meter in the bottom right of the screen fills, and when at least 50% full, players press the Y button to launch a brief cinematic sequence as the plane auto-maneuvers behind the nearest target. When under attack, an onscreen warning briefly warns the player the direction to dodge, which is performed from a combination of a directional push on the analog nub and the Y button. </p>\n<p>All gameplay is performed on the 3-D screen, which also features cinematics and mission briefings. During gameplay, the top screen also features the gameplay HUD with the altimeter and the Maneuver meter, as well as broadcasting warnings of incoming missiles. Congratulatory statements also appear on the top screen during successful kills. The bottom, or touch-screen, is where all other information is displayed, including a radar window, which is adjustable by pressing up or down on the D-Pad, and missile selection is displayed and performed by pressing left or right on the D-Pad. Subtitles and aircraft status (health) are also displayed on the bottom screen. No part of the gameplay is dependant on touch-screen controls.</p>\n<p>Missions are scored and graded, and both the score and the timer both constantly run on the bottom screen during gameplay. As players progress, they earn money (from score and kills), and experience that is largely used to increase in rank, but has no real effect during actual gameplay.</p>\n<p>Besides the main story mode, there is also a Challenge mode with features such as Survival missions. There is also a gallery where players may view planes, weapons, and items in the game and read information about them, as well as a gallery on the main characters in the game with information detailing their backstories. Beyond this, players have the option to save up to 15 complete replays of missions to the SD card, which may be viewed from a variety of camera angles.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Pushmo</em> is a puzzle game in the vain of titles such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3725/chuchu-rocket/\">ChuChu Rocket!</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/46970/picross-3d/\">Picross 3D</a> in that it features an uncomplicated interface which is flexible enough to be translated into hundreds of different puzzles. Also like <em>ChuChu Rocket</em> and <em>Picross 3-D</em>, <em>Pushmo</em> encourages players to get in on the creativity, and allows for data sharing.</p>\n<p><em>Pushmo</em> is designed around stacks of blocks that are initially flat against the background, but which can and must be pulled forward or pushed back into the background with the goal of building 3-D platforming-based structures to reach a goal, usually placed at the top of a structure. The game can be thought of as a stack of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/42121/tetris/\">Tetris</a> blocks where players can pull the blocks towards them (the screen) with the goal of creating a 3-D platforming staircase. The blocks can be pulled out up to three levels in depth and the challenge comes from deciphering exactly how to pull and push the blocks in order to create a manageable route to the top. </p>\n<p>Besides being able to push and pull the Pushmo blocks, there are also a few modifiers. Switches are present which, when activated, cause all blocks the same color as the switch to be pushed to the maximum depth of three levels. There are also manholes which allow for travel between two locations. Multiple sets of manholes and multiple color switches may be present in a single puzzle. There is also a large reset button on the ground should too many mistakes create a structure that cannot be repaired. For quick mistakes, there is a set amount of time which may be \"rewound.\" For instance, if a player accidentally drops off the top of a Pushmo, but moving up the structure makes climbing it again impossible, the player may hold down the L button to rewind the several seconds which covered the fall. This rewind feature has a limited total use per puzzle.</p>\n<p>Storywise, the protagonist is challenged by a trouble-making kid who has collapsed the stacks of Pushmo, and upon doing so, has trapped other children inside the things. The hero, Mallo, is a kindly fellow (somewhat resembling a sumo wrestler in design) and eagerly devotes himself to solving the Pushmo puzzles and freeing the children. Early tutorials are handled by Papa Blox who is the maker of the Pushmo puzzles, the educator offering advice early on, and the narrator giving some clues to the story elements. The main campaign features over 200 puzzles to be solved.</p>\n<p>Like <em>ChuChu Rocket</em> and <em>Picross 3-D</em>, players have the ability to craft their own Pushmo with a simple-to-use level builder that allows for puzzles to be drawn with the 3DS stylus. Completed puzzles are saved to the 3DS system's SD card, and once a puzzle has been completed and verified through a play-test, a QR code may be generated for the level and saved as a photo on the SD card to be shared. Sharing puzzles is as simple as copying the picture of the QR code from the SD card to a computer and emailing it or posting it online. The QR codes can then be photographed with the Nintendo 3DS camera and added to the SD card simply by selecting an empty puzzle block in the Pushmo Studio (the editor), and centering the QR code in brackets on the top screen. It does not even need to be photographed, once recognized, it's instantly loaded into the game. The game allows for nearly a hundred downloaded or custom levels, all of which are saved to the SD card. Only personally crafted puzzles may be shared, and players may choose to lock a puzzle so others may use it, but not edit or copy it.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Nano Assault</em> is the third in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/22312/nanostray/\">Nanostray</a> series for Nintendo's DS line. <em>Nano Assault</em> takes place in the same fictional \"universe\" as the <em>Nanostray</em> games, is still built on a shoot-em-up framework, and still uses the Nanostray virus as a focal point to the plot, but differs widely in gameplay style over its DS <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/34311/nanostray-2/\">predecessor</a>. Where the previous titles followed a classic vertical and side-scrolling shmup formula, <em>Nano Assault</em> replaces this with three different shmup set-ups.</p>\n<p>The bulk of the game is played in an overhead 360-degree shooter style similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/23390/geometry-wars-retro-evolved/\">Geometry Wars</a> where movement is performed with the analog nub and shooting takes place in all directions using the ABXY buttons in place of a second analog control. These stages take place with the microscopic ship of series fame flying over giant cells fighting off infections and viruses (bad guys) and picking up DNA sequences. The primary focus of these stages is to eradicate all enemies and to collect all DNA strands. These are referred to as Twin Shooter, or Ground missions. The Nanite ship fires three bullets per shot in this mode, and can utilize one of four secondary weapons with the R button. The spread of the bullets may be modified with the L button.</p>\n<p>The second gameplay style comes in the form of 2.5-D boss battles which take place on a large circular area with a boss character in the center. From the perspective on-screen, the player moves the ship left or right along a 2-D plane and must fire into the background at the boss, or to either side against other attackers or pieces of said boss character. The primary focus of this mode is simply to destroy the boss character. These are a variation of the Twin Shooter missions.</p>\n<p>The third perspective is that of a 3rd-Person, behind-the-ship view flying through 3-D corridors within an organic body firing on infections and other things. Enemies move and swirl into the play area in typical shmup forms and patterns. Players are tasked with dodging obstacles as well as destroying enemies and this is the only mode where dodging environmental hazards is really important. The primary focus of this mode is survival culminating in a boss battle. These are the 3D Action Shooter, or Flying missions. In this mode, the Nanite ship fires single shots and may use some but not all of the secondary weapons.</p>\n<p>Besides the main Story Mode, there is an Arcade Mode wherein stages completed in Story Mode may be replayed for fun, high scores for Leaderboards, and to complete specific challenges set for each stage. Challenges include completing without dying, completing without using the secondary weapon, or obtaining a set high score. Completing challenges earns Nano Coins which are used to purchase songs for the Jukebox or enemy profiles for the Nanopedia. Finally, there is also a Boss Rush Mode unlocked after completing the game, and this mode also allows for earning Nano Coins. Nintendo 3DS Coins may be converted into Nano Coins. </p>\n<p>Plot-wise, the focus of the game is similar to the previous entries, in that players assume the role of a nanite vehicle and travel inside an organic body attempting to thwart the deadly Nanostray virus, and to prevent it from spreading throughout civilization. This includes numerous boss battles, both as stand-alone events and as the climaxes of some stages. The levels are broken up into Cell Clusters, and within each Cell Cluster is a number, usually around 5 or 6, individual Cells, which represent the stages. Overall, there are 32 Cell stages and 10 boss battles.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Nintendogs + Cats</em> is a real-time pet simulator featuring several popular breeds of puppies and kittens. The game allows the player to interact with a virtual pet by speaking commands into the microphone, and by simulating physical actions with the touch screen. The animals also respond to a familiar face by use of the system's camera, allowing your pets to respond to your presence and return. Some tasks will include fulfilling everyday pet owner responsibilities like feeding your pets, walking your pets, and showing them affection. There are also several toys that can be purchased for your pet that allow for all types of games like frisbee, tug of war, and fetch the ball. There are several commands and tricks to teach your pet, which if successfully done can lead to a trophy in one of the dog competitions accessible later in the game. Other new features found in this game over the previous Nintendo DS incarnation include the ability to take 3D pictures of your pets, and much improved network and communication features that allow you meet other virtual pets in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p>The <em>Golden Retriever</em> (<em>Shiba</em> in Japan) version of the game contains the following dog breeds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Golden Retriever</li>\n<li>Shiba</li>\n<li>Beagle</li>\n<li>Miniature Pinscher</li>\n<li>Dacshund</li>\n<li>Maltese</li>\n<li>Pug</li>\n<li>Great Dane</li>\n<li>Cocker Spaniel</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, the game includes three types of cats; Siamese, standard and long-haired cat. The cats interact less to the player's commands, and do their own thing in comparison to the dogs' more obedient behavior.</p>",

The game continues the tradition of featuring various courses for eight players to race through while using a number of different power ups; avoiding banana peels, and launching red shell projectiles at rival opponents. The mechanics of <em>Mario Kart</em> have evolved allowing the race karts to transform in the middle of a race between a hang glider and a hydro submersible vehicle upon encountering aerial of underwater course segments respectively. The customization also introduces new features in building the ultimate vehicle, choosing from various frames which range in weight, a selection of tires which affect the handling of the vehicle on certain surfaces. There are 32 selectable tracks of which sixteen are new tracks, and the others are enhanced tracks from previous games. Several returning items like Koopa Shells, Banana Peels, and Super Mushrooms are present. <em>Mario Kart 7</em> also features three items new to the <em>Mario Kart</em> series: the Fire Flower, the Super Leaf, and Lucky 7, which bestows seven items at once. In addition to traditional controls, <em>Mario Kart 7</em> can be played using the Nintendo 3DS gyroscope, in which the action is viewed in first person and the player steers the kart simply by turning the entire game system. While racing, collecting coins can provide the vehicle with a brief boost of speed. </p>\n<p>Multiplayer is supported for up to eight people in Grand Prix, VS, and Battle Modes. Time trial \"ghost\" data can be shared as well, and Nintendo 3DS owners who don't have the game can use the Download &amp; Play option to join in Grand Prix mode. The improved multiplayer mode allows eight players to connect online and compete together. Players will be treated with a detailed stat tracker that can be exchanged with other players through StreetPass and SpotPass networking features. The innovative community feature allows for several online customization, matchmaking, and player networking.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mahjong Cub3D</em> is a puzzle game that is both the classic Mahjong (sometimes known as Shanghai) solitaire game, and a new puzzle game based on Mahjong rules and tiles. <em>Mahjong Cub3D</em> features three gameplay modes: Cube Mode, Vs. Mode, and Classic Mode. The game also features detailed records and statistics covering completions rates, the number of times a puzzle is played, and the time it took for completion. Also, along with other typical Mahjong video games, each mode has the option for players to utilize a hint system, but there are limited uses.</p>\n<p>Cube Mode is the primary focus of the title, and the mode which most emphasizes the 3-D capabilities of the 3DS. Here, rather than traditional Mahjong tiles, the gameplay pieces are cubes. Like traditional Mahjong, the goal is the same: remove the tiles from the puzzle one pair at a time. As with the classic game, players can only select pieces that aren't \"blocked in\", either against the face area of the cube or on the sides. The sides of the blocks are annotated with notches on the cubes, and at least one notched side must be open (with no cubes against it) in order for players to select and remove the cube. Players have the ability to zoom the camera in and out of the entire puzzle, and to rotate the 3-D structure in order to find matches. The Mahjong cubes feature traditional patterns on them including chinese characters, numbers of dots or other items, flowers, and the like. When playing any puzzle, players may choose the difficulty, time limit, and whether or not there are hidden tiles, although time limits may only be toggled on completed puzzles.</p>\n<p>Vs. Mode is a multiplayer mode based on Cube Mode and works with a single game card and challenges two players against each other. In this mode, there are two gold tiles inside the puzzles, and the first player to remove both of them in their puzzle wins. There are tiles that affect gameplay which launch attacks against the opponent player. Hint tiles temporarily display the best possible next matches, Blind tiles temporarily obscure the faces of the opponent's tiles, and Quake tiles cause the opponent board to shake, disrupting gameplay. During Vs. Mode, the opponent's puzzle is visible in the background, and updated in real-time during gameplay.</p>\n<p>Classic Mode is exactly as expected for anyone familiar with Mahjong or Shanghai. Tiles are stacked in a variety of shapes on a 2-D plane, with the same goal as the rest of the game: clear the board by matching open or \"free\" tiles. Tiles are only considered free when they are open on either the left or right side and have nothing stacked on top of them. The game ends when no more pairs can be selected, but it is only beaten when all the tiles are cleared from the board. As with Cube Mode, players may choose whether or not to have time limits or hidden tiles. Since this mode takes place on a 2-D plane, players have no need to rotate the puzzles, but they can zoom in and out.</p>\n<p>Completing puzzles in either Cube or Classic mode unlocks more puzzles in the game. Initially, only three Cube courses are available, and each course contains 20 puzzles, with five more courses eventually available. There are also 20 Classic maps.</p>",

During the night, the rock monsters arrive to attack the village, so to support the defences he's built up, Dillon will fight them by rolling into a ball and charging at them. The player can roll Dillon into a ball using the touch screen and control his direction while rolling using the circle pad.

        "description": "<p><em>Kid Icarus Uprising</em> is the third full game in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10072/kid-icarus/\">Kid Icarus</a> series with a story taking place 25 years after the events of the first game--as well as being released 25 years later. </p>\n<p>The story involves the recent uprising of Underworld forces and the return of Medusa, who, as it happens, has waited 25 years for this return. The goddess Palutena has called upon her greatest servant, Pit, to jump into the fray to defend Palutena's honor and to take out all the Underworld forces. Pit flies over a variety of landscapes and environments and into the fray through intense ground missions. Palutena has only enough power to grant Pit the power of flight for five minutes, during which time, Pit must reach his next destination. Afterwards, Pit takes the fight to the ground. The story is told through fully voice-acted dialog during gameplay, with character art appearing on the lower screen. </p>\n<p>The basic gameplay is a shooter similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/46494/sin-punishment-star-successor/\">Sin &amp; Punishment: Star Successor</a>, where players move Pit with the Circle Pad and target enemies with the touch-screen. Firing shots is performed with the L button. There is a lefty mode handled with the Circle Pad Pro, but no dual-analog/Circle Pad option. Each stage is broken up into two segments: An aerial segment with Pit flying to his destination, and a ground segment with Pit venturing towards a goal (typically with a boss) on foot. Basic controls are largely the same for both segments with some exceptions. On foot, players can swing the camera around by swiping the touch-screen, as well as access a variety of Powers. During aerial segments, the camera is automatic and there are two Special Attack icons which are filled during combat.</p>\n<p>Players have numerous Powers that can be obtained and used. Powers are organized in a grid, and each power has a geometric shape associated with it. More powerful abilities have larger or more elaborate shapes, and there is an element of Tetris to organizing the Powers in the grid. These Powers run the gamut of inflicting poison damage, recovering health, jumping, effect recovery, alternate weapons (lasers, mines, etc), and several others. Powers are typically discovered through regular gameplay and hidden among the ground-based segments of the stages. Higher difficulties may yield higher quality Powers. Players may save up to four different sets of Powers for solo gameplay.</p>\n<p>Like Powers, weapons are also numerous and featured in a wide variety of categories. There are nine types of weapons: Staffs, Bows, Clubs, Orbitars, Blades, Claws, Palms, Cannons, and Arms. While each weapon has both shooting and melee abilities, different weapon types yield different strengths and weaknesses to each ability. Cannons and Orbitars, for instance, are great at long-range combat. Clubs, Claws, and Arms on the other hand are superior melee weapons often with short distances in their shooting range, but yielding immense power in close-quarters. Beyond the standard traits of the styles of weapons, each weapon also has a star rating evaluating their melee and ranged strengths, as well as an overall value giving an idea to how much overall power they yield. There may be numerous types of a single weapon, and beyond category, melee rating, ranged rating, and value--weapons may also carry a variety of unique perks. These perks range from raising total health, to minimizing the effects of certain attacks, to increasing speed. Weapons are earned through online play, purchased, or discovered through regular gameplay hidden in chests or secret areas. And finally, should a player be less than pleased with the weapons they'd obtained, there is always the option to fuse weapons together to create entirely new ones.</p>\n<p>The main currency of the game is hearts, which are generally used for purchasing weapons. Hearts are factored into the unique difficulty, referred to as \"Intensity,\" settings of the game, which can be set from 0.0 to 9.9. Players may \"bet hearts\" prior to starting a stage by setting higher Intensity settings. Completing the stage without failing means players earn bonus hearts at the end. However, each time a player dies, the Intensity drops ten levels, so a level set to 6.6 will drop to 5.6. Higher Intensity settings yield more than just bonus hearts, however. Stages routinely feature closed-off sections with numbers over the gates indicating that they can only be entered with an Intensity setting at least as high as noted. Beyond that, treasures are likely to contain vastly more powerful weapons than lower Intensity levels. </p>\n<p><em>Kid Icarus Uprising</em> has a wealth of unlockables and bonus features including an Idol gallery (essentially a character and item art gallery), a practice mode, a music gallery, a mode compatible with AR Cards released for the game (it ships with six randomly selected cards), and over 200 challenges, or achievements, set up in a manner similar to the challenges in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/33378/super-smash-bros-brawl/\">Super Smash Bros Brawl</a>. Up to three AR Cards may be viewed at one time, and if set facing each other, the characters may interact or battle each other. The game also ships with a free stand for the 3DS system to aid in playing games of this nature. The game is also compatible with Street Pass and Spot Pass for trading items such as weapons and gems.</p>\n<p>Lastly, <em>Uprising</em> features multiplayer matches for up to six players in both local and online matches, with friends or random players. The multiplayer matches are generally deathmatch-style affairs in either a free-for-all format or team, 3-versus-3 matches. Similar to players saving sets of Powers for solo play, they may also save different sets of weapons and Powers for quick access for multiplayer games. This allows players to set up equipment with various focuses tailored to their gameplay style, or styles, for multiplayer matches.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Doctor Lautrec and the Forgotten Knights</em> is a puzzle-based adventure with strategy and RPG-elements mixed in. It revolves around the adventures of Doctor Lautrec, a professor of Archeology at the Museum of Natural History in Paris, at the end of the 19th century. He has recently heard rumours that there is an underground system of dungeons beneath the city, and that there is treasure there that could be linked to Louis XIV. Weirdly enough, it is said that the treasures are somehow alive and protected by the spirit creatures inhabiting them. and many adventurers who have gone to find this so-called \"Treasure Animatus\" have never returned form their perilous journey. Intrigued, Doctor Lautrec sets out to a local tavern to buy a treasure map.</p>\n<p>To find the treasure, players have to follow a quest through to the end. Each one starts with the treasure map obtained at Le Repaire, which consists of a cryptic riddle. Doctor Lautrec and Sophie discuss the riddle with no active player input and eventually this results in a number of possible locations. These can be visited in turn, either to find NPC's giving them more clues, a dead end (in which case more discussion follows) or the entrance to the dungeon. Once inside, the player explores several floors of the dungeon, each containing several rooms filled with traps, guards and/or crates. Each room requires a different approach, for instance pushing crates into gaps in traversable walls, avoiding the guards or timing your way around flaming arrows being shot at regular intervals. Some rooms have chests containing jewels that are optional but can help later on. Each dungeon has one main treasure room and several additional treasure rooms, each with a puzzle lock. Puzzle locks come in a handful of varieties: spot-the-differences puzzles, logic complete-the-sequence puzzles, crosswords in French (the words are given but you have to find the correct location in the grid), a three-dimensional jigsaw and a Minesweeper-variant. </p>\n<p>Once open, the treasure room reveals an egg containing the Treasure Animatus. Sophie reveals which kind it is (there are five types that have strengths and weaknesses against each other in a rock-paper-scissors kind of way) and the player has to place treasure already in their possession from earlier quests and the jewels from the chest on pedestals around it to 'tame' the spirit. Some treasures have additional effects when placed close together (synergy effect). The goal is to do enough damage to get a meter into the red zone. Doing too much damage leads to the spirit being 'extinguished', which makes the treasure worthless. This can also happen to treasure you have placed on the pedestals. It is possible to revive 'dead' treasure with special stones you can buy at the Tavern, but these come in five types as well and you can only bring three into the dungeon with you. The additional treasure rooms are not necessary for the main quest, but skipping them will result in a lower Reputation Score and can also lead to the player missing some cut scenes. As soon as the Treasure Animatus from the main treasure room is tamed or killed, Lautrec and Sophie are transported back to Le Repaire, where after a cutscene a new quest can be started.</p>",

This peace is threatened when one of the Lords, Ataraxis, ruler of the city of Nexus, is taken ill by a deadly curse. A call is sent out, promising rewards beyond measure for anyone who finds a cure. Four mercenaries, each with their own strengths, weaknesses and motivations answer the call. One uses forbidden spells to rain death on her foes, one has guns and bombs to blast his way through, another has a mighty sword capable of slicing through entire packs of enemies, and one other gains strength from savagely tearing through anything that stands in his way with brutal, bladed fists.</p>\n<p><em>Heroes of Ruin</em> is a dungeon exploration based action role-playing game. The player can build a character based on a series of classes with various techniques ranging from close to long-range combat, as well as offensive and defensive magic abilities. Players can take quests from NPCs in Nexus and venture into the world to complete them. If the player so wishes, they can be joined by up to three other players, either locally or online. They can either join another player's game at random or set up their own game to complete story quests in co-operative mode. Players can communicate with other online players using voice chat. There are also daily challenges downloadable from the internet for the player to undertake.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Animal Crossing: New Leaf</em> is a social simulation game. The player takes on the role as the new mayor in a small village populated by animals. Gameplay consists of improving the village with new buildings and decorations, collecting furniture and items for one's house, and donating fossils, fish, insects and art to the local museum.</p>\n<p>Several features in the game make their series debut here, while others have been brought back from older <em>Animal Crossing</em> games after having not been seen in the DS or Wii entries. These include public works projects, which allow new landmarks and buildings to be added to the town, as well as altering the appearance of certain major buildings; the Dream Suite, which allows players to visit other towns in a single-player session; a tropical island that hosts minigames and multiplayer interactions; Re-Tail, a store that acts as a flea market and allows the player to customize certain furniture items with alternate color schemes or patterns; and QR code sharing for player-made clothing and patterns.</p>\n<p>A free update, titled <em>Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo</em>, was released in late 2016. This patch added amiibo functionality, including 64 villagers only available through the use of a corresponding card or figure. 50 of these are villagers who had previously only appeared in the GameCube and/or Nintendo 64 installments of the series; the other 14 are tie-in villagers that represent characters from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=The+Legend+of+Zelda+series\">The Legend of Zelda</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/73389/splatoon/\">Splatoon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/7144/monster-hunter-series/\">Monster Hunter</a>, and <em>Hello Kitty</em>. Other features include new items and currency, an RV campground near the outskirts of town, minigames and features from <em>Animal Crossing</em> spin-off titles, and several miscellaneous features intended for the player's convenience.</p>",

The player's party and enemies are represented as counters on a board, which is navigated by moving between rooms. Attack options are selected from a menu system and their power is determined by rolling dice, which the player starts with two of but can acquire more as the game progresses. Dice are also used to determine whether the party can escape an enemy encounter.</p>\n<p>Rather than a traditional levelling system, a character's attributes are directly tied to their equipment. At the end of a successful battle, the quantity of items they can collect is determined by how quickly they dispatched their enemies.</p>",

        "description": "<p>East Mikado is a fantasy land reminiscent of the feudal Japan. The protagonist of the game is a young samurai entrusted with the task of tracking down a mysterious being known as the Black Samurai. It appears that lately more and more people were being turned into demons because of the books handed to them by that enigmatic person. As the hero and his friends investigate the matter they become involved in a conflict between two faiths, the Mikado church and the cult of Gaia.</p>\n<p><em>Shin Megami Tensei IV</em> is a role-playing game and a part of the main series in the Megami Tensei universe, though story-wise it is not connected to its immediate <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/15180/shin-megami-tensei-nocturne/\">predecessor</a>. It is also one of the few Megami Tensei titles that are not set in a modern-day or post-apocalyptic environment. However, the game features many recurrent themes of the series, such as the struggle between the forces of Law and Chaos. During the course of the plot the player will be prompted to make crucial decisions that affect the protagonist's standing with the two warring factions, leading to different endgame sequences.</p>\n<p>The core gameplay is very similar to that of the previous titles. The player controls a party consisting of the protagonist and demons that can be recruited by verbally communicating with them during battles. There are no random battles and all enemies are visible on the exploration screen. The turn-based combat utilizes the press turn system first introduced in <em>Nocturne</em>. Exploitation of weaknesses is further emphasized, as both player-controlled party and opponents lose rounds in combat when their weakpoints are hit. The series' traditional demon fusion system is present as well. Like in the previous games, the hero's attributes can be increased manually when leveling up. New elements include experience points awarded for completing side quests or during successful demon negotiations, as well as the protagonist's ability to learn the skills of the demons in his party if certain conditions are met.</p>",

A chance encounter with an amnesiac strategist leads him and his fellow soldiers, the Shepherds, to discover a force of undead Risen, whom they dispatch with the aid of a masked swordswinger using the name of the legendary hero-king Marth. The Shepherds must keep these forces at bay, whilst also defending Ylisse from the warring nation of Plegia.</p>\n<p><em>Fire Emblem Awakening</em> is a tactical role-playing game set in the same world as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Fire+Emblem:+Ankoku+Ry%C5%AB+to+Hikari+no+Tsurugi\">Ankoku Ry\u016b to Hikari no Tsurugi</a>, centuries later. The story follows the player's avatar, who acts as Chrom's aide and has customisable appearance and combat specialities. In battle, the player can move their soldiers around the field and attack enemy soldiers either on their own or paired with another ally. As any two soldiers fight together, their relationship will build, which will make them stronger when paired. Pairings of the opposite sex can marry once their relationship has been built enough, and their children shall become soldiers.</p>\n<p>The game has four difficulty modes, as well as the option to player in Casual mode, where fallen heroes recover after a battle, or Classic mode, where fallen heroes are lost forever. Each chapter takes place in a new field; Risen and merchants shall periodically visit the fields of previous chapters. Players can form teams to send to other players via StreetPass, who can then parley with the team to purchase items or battle; if they are successful, they will have the opportunity to recruit their player avatar. Additional chapters are made available to download, either free or purchased, as well as heroes from previous games in the series. Players can also play a co-operative Dual Tag mode to fight against enemies as a team.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Kokuga is a slow-moving, free-scrolling top-down shooter where players are placed in control of a futuristic \"compact mobile tank\" known as Kokuga.  The Kokuga is suspended on four \"legs\" and features a single turret capable of rotating 360 degrees using the shoulder buttons.  </p>\n<p>Each stage has the player move through destroying other mechanical, tank-like, turret-like, and robotic enemies.  Most stages end with massive and varied boss battles.  Stages are separated into segments with large gates at the dividers--destroying all enemies before destroying the divider resorts in bonus shield repairs.  Destroying the gate without defeating all the enemies in that section merely results in all enemies therein being annihilated.  </p>\n<p>Kokuga differentiates itself from most other shooters in a variety of ways.  Rather than collecting power-ups, players already have 20 \"cards\" to utilize.  Of these 20 attack and support cards, four are randomly displayed on the touch-screen at a time and offer a variety of abilities, from an offensive laser ring around the player, to homing shots, to shield restoration and damage repairs.  Players cannot cycle through the cards, and in order to get new ones, at least one current card must be used.  In this way, the game offers an unusual strategy element to the shooter gameplay--careful and planned use of power-up cards over simply powering up as much as possible as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Also different is the level set-up.  There are three \"final\" stages at the corners of a triangular grid which make up the final stages.  The stages themselves are laid out somewhat like a keyboard labeled with letters A~L, and a player may start at any stage.  However, continuing through the game requires a player to select an adjacent stage from the completed first. </p>\n<p>A final \"game ending\" stage can only be played once an adjacent stage has been completed. In this way, players may play for as long or as short as they wish.  With games encompassing several stages, or just a couple.  This longer game option even allows players to replay a completed stage--but it will automatically be at a higher difficulty.  In this way, a player's game could be as short as two stages (a regular and a final) or as long as 37 (all regular three times, and one final).</p>\n<p>In a vain similar to the dark, nigh-genocidal story behind titles like Ikaruga, the story here is a bleak melodrama focused on ethnic rivalries and the incomprehensible nature of humans.  The similarity is likely due to the game sharing the same director (Hiroshi Iuchi) as Ikaruga.  No actual countries are named, rather, they are listed by letters with \"Country A\" and \"Country I.\"  The story is played out in largely text-based cut-scenes with dark background imagery.  The text itself carries a militaristic flavor to it, further adding to the melodrama of the story.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Monster Shooter is a top-down shooter in the vein of classic action-shooter titles like Smash TV or Total Carnage.</p>\n<p>Players take the role of a relatively benign alien who just happens to be pretty versatile with a large assortment of weapons.  The alien ends up, by way of general bad luck, stuck on hostile alien worlds where he must, essentially, shoot his way through hordes of alien octopuses to escape.  The shooter gameplay is built with an aim assist which allows for faster and smoother gameplay than the much older Smash TV style.</p>\n<p>A mild RPG-style experience and perks system backs the basic gameplay in a unique way.  Players earn experience quickly, and can add perks to their character, such as increasing the rate of fire of the weapons, making reloads faster, improving health, etc.  Unlike a traditional RPG (or similar game), these perks are not permanent and do not carry over after a level is finished.  In this way, players can tweak their character every level to what may be specifically beneficial at the time.  If a player wants to specify speed for a level, they may. If they want to emphasize health, they may.  </p>\n<p>Players may earn money by completing levels or by picking up money during gameplay, and this can be used to purchase weapons, weapon upgrades, items, and a few permanent perks.  Money is also earned by gaining rank in the game through the completion of various achievement-like Missions.  The player is given three of these at a time, and competing each one works toward building ranks.  These Missions are typically number-based, i.e. kill 100 of a certain enemy, kill 500 enemies with a certain weapon, use an item 50 times, etc.  </p>\n<p>There is a variety of weapons including the default SMG, a shotgun, an electric gun, rocket launcher, grenades, mines, etc.  The primary game is a story mode with 60 levels, and a survival mode which may be played on any of the three planets.  Weapon upgrades carry over to Survival mode.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>3D MahJongg</em> is a new take on the old game of Mahjong Solitaire (a.k.a. Shanghai Solitaire). It uses the same set of 144 tiles. The object of the game is simple; find two matching tiles that are not blocked by other tiles on either side (up and down is not an option), and slowly whittle away at the layout till all of the tiles have been removed. While simple in practice, the possibilities are endless.</p>\n<p>The game has two sets of rules, Rivers and Classic. In Rivers, tiles must be on the same layer, and the line connecting them may not change direction more than twice. In Classic, tiles must not be covered by other tiles, and must be free to their left or right side.</p>\n<p>The game has two modes: Free Play and Adventure mode which has 200 combinations of the available options you must solve completely before moving forward. There is no basic \"save\" feature, but rather you create a profile, and if you turn off the 3DS it will start you at the next level to be completed when you return to Adventure mode.</p>\n<p>The layout is viewed on the touch screen and the 3D screen. You chose your matching tiles (or the option to rewind or fast forward your moves) on the touch screen, and a 3D representation of the layout is seen on the upper screen.</p>\n<p>The layouts are represented in 3D and with 50 different types, along with six different animated 3D backgrounds called \"Scenes\", as well as six different touch screen backgrounds, and six different tile sets which includes sea creatures, zombies, fantasy characters and traditional playing cards. Like many puzzle games with multiple options, you have to unlock the additional layouts, scenes, backgrounds and tile sets, which is done through Adventure mode.</p>",

In this mode, Spider-Man has to take back New York City. The player is presented with a map and chooses between districts. Each of those districts has a number of story missions associated with it: a situation is displayed in text and the player has to choose between several approaches, e.g. using web rush. Each choice has a certain percentage of success and rewards vigilante points - usually harder options reward more points. Collecting enough vigilante points results in a level up which improves the success chances, unlocks more missions and refills action points. Those are important because every time the player attempts a mission, a certain amount of action points has to be paid. If the player runs out of action points, 3DS play coins (StreetPass) can also be used to refill them.</p>\n<p>Daily missions reward more vigilante points, but in addition to action points also require other items like web fluid to be started. Those items are earned in collection missions, but the chance to receive the item in question is lower than the overall success chance. The goal is to clear the city in order to unlock a costume for the main game.</p>",

        "description": "<p>One day, the people from the Mushroom Kingdom receive an invitation to visit Pi'illo Island, turned into a touristic region. As they visit the castle, Mario and Luigi stumble into an ancient artifact looking like a stone pillow. As Luigi falls asleep on it, a dark character appears and kidnaps Princess Peach and take her inside Luigi's Dream.</p>\n<p><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Dream Team</em> plays roughly like the previous <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/2038/mario-rpg-series/\">Mario &amp; Luigi RPG games</a>. The player controls both Mario and Luigi at the same time, using the A button to make Mario perform various actions and the B button to make Luigi perform similar actions. The battles are turn-based and also use the A and B button to control Mario and Luigi. Pressing the buttons at the right moment allows the brothers to make extra attacks, deal extra damage, and evade or counter enemy attacks. When a battle is over, the brothers gain experience and eventually level-up. As they do, their stats rise and the player can choose a stat to rise even more by using a slot-machine like system. At certain levels, they change ranks (from Mushroom to Shell rank, from Shell to Flower rank and so on). When changing ranks, the player can choose one bonus (such as an extra equipment slot, higher HP, etc.) from a list.</p>\n<p>The game is split between the Real World and the Dream World, both having gameplay differences. The Real World has a top-down view and both Luigi and Mario fight in battle, while the Dream World has a side-scrolling view and, since the Dream World is inside Luigi's dreams, Luigi himself is repalced by his dream alter-ego, Dreamy Luigi. Dreamy Luigi has the same basic controls as Luigi, but he can sometimes merge with the Dream World to help Mario solve puzzles and reach certain areas. Such actions are called 'Luigination' or 'Luginary Skills' and use the touch screen to interact with the Real World Luigi, causing changes in the Dream World. In battle, Mario fights alone, with Dreamy Luigi merging with him to give him higher stats. When Mario Jumps on an enemy, for instance, Dreamy Luigi will also jump on the enemies. Like in the other <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/2038/mario-rpg-series/\">Mario &amp; Luigi RPG games</a>, special attacks called Bros. attacks can be used to deal heavy damage by using both brother's skills. In the Dream World, the Bros. Attacks are replaced with Luiginary Attacks. These use Dreamy Luigi clones called Luiginoids.</p>\n<p>There are special giant boss battles that play holding the 3DS sideways like a book and using the stylus to attack, evade and counter. In these fights, Dreamy Luigi gets bigger and fights the foe with Mario helping him.</p>\n<p>Various items and equipment can be found all over the map, with some, like beans and rescued Pi'illo folks, having a menu to show how many have been found. The collection menu also has an 'Expert Challenge' menu, showing points-awarding goals to achieve in battle. Completing these challenges awards equipment pieces.</p>",

Traditional tight relation between each of the dungeons and one of Link's items \u2014 which the solution of the dungeon hinges upon \u2014 is maintained; for the first time in the series items aren't hid in their relative dungeon, yet, for the large part of them, available at the shop of Ravio, a rabbit-like shopkeeper. The hookshot, hammer, ice rod, and many other items are rentable and purchasable from there from the beginning of Link's adventure: rentals cost little, yet the item is lost if Link happens to die; purchases cost more, yet grant permanent possession, and the possibility to give the item one upgrade. An energy bar, which decreases when Links uses any depletable object, and replenishes by time, replaces the series' \u00abammunition\u00bb system: this time Link does not carry bomb or arrow stocks with himself.</p>\n<p>The game world, Hyrule, closely reprises that of the previous game; however, contrarily to the tradition of the series, this adventure is world-driven: many areas of the world are reachable from the early stage of the game, and dungeons can be ventured through in order at will. Two-sided game world structure has been kept.\nPuzzles are encountered not only in dungeons, but also in the open world; a part of them revolves around the game's 3D visual effect; owing to this, while <em>A Link Between Worlds</em> is playable on 2DS, solving some puzzles gets less intuitive.\nA new skill Link has is to flatten: as a bidimensional being he can for instance slide along surfaces, make his way through narrow passages, and perform several other moves required to overcome puzzles.</p>\n<p>DS touch-screen display shows the world, or dungeon, map; notes can be taken on it by placing pins.</p>",

        "description": "<p>With the threat of the evil Xehanort's return, King Mickey and Yen Sid have begun preparations to combat him. Their first step is to turn Keyblade wielders Sora and Riku into Keyblade Masters. Sora and Riku are given the task of completing the Mark of Mastery exam which when completed will help them obtain a great power to aid in the fight against Xehanort. This test will not be so easy as the two must venture together into seven Sleeping Worlds and find the the Keyholes of Sleep to awaken them. Along the way they meet new friends and face new enemies in worlds completely new to them. These challenges will forever test their abilities and lead to an ultimate test to prevent the darkness from overtaken their light.</p>\n<p><em>Dream Drop Distance</em> takes place immediately after the events of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/21912/kingdom-hearts-ii/\">Kingdom Hearts II</a>. Sora learns from a letter he receives from King Mickey that he is the only one who can save those lost who are connected to him; referring to the characters Ventus, Aqua, and Terra from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/48085/kingdom-hearts-birth-by-sleep/\">Birth by Sleep</a>. Sora and Riku travel to worlds based on settings from various Disney properties such as La Cit\u00e9 des Cloches (The Hunchback of Notre Dame), Prankster's Paradise (Pinnochio), Symphony of Sorcery (Fantasia) and The Grid (Tron). </p>\n<p>The game utilizes a gameplay mechanic called Flowmotion which allows your character to quickly bounce off walls and scale buildings in short bursts of speed. A Drop system has been implemented which changes the control of your character to either Sora or Riku after a certain amount of time. While playing as Sora/Riku and the Drop Gauge reaches 0, your character will switch to the other who can be in an entirely different world at a completely different time. The game is an action-RPG with gameplay similar to <em>Birth by Sleep</em> in which it uses the Command Deck system. The Command Deck lets you create your own customized deck of actions such as items and spells for quick use. Dream Eaters are introduced as new enemies. Some of these Dream Eaters known as Spirits can be recruited and further enhance your abilities in-game by strengthening your powers and giving you new attacks.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Warrior's Way</em> is a simple strategy game for the Nintendo 3DS, where the player faces off against a variety of opponents in a series of \"rock, paper, scissors\" battles. The player's army is split up into three units: cavalry (rock), archers (scissors), and infantry (paper). The player is allowed to allocate troops between these three divisions, adjusting size as desired. Battles are three rounds long. For each round, the player chooses the unit they want to attack and then the results are decided not only based on the classic rock &gt; scissors &gt; paper &gt; rock paradigm, but also on the size of each army, with bigger being better. It is possible for a player to overcome a type disadvantage by sheer numbers. Other factors may influence the battle, such as ground conditions and \"special\" opposing troop types like berserkers and ninjas.</p>\n<p>The game is a <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/3ds/nintendo-3ds-included-games\">StreetPass Mii Plaza</a> game, using StreetPass tags collected by the player's system as an integral part of gameplay. Each tag that the player collects is an \"army\" that the player encounters; the size of the army is determined by the number of StreetPass encounters the other player has had. Players who do not have the game are merely friendly generals with armies that the player adds to their existing troops, while players who also own the game appear as rival Monarchs that the player then has the option of greeting peacefully or attacking. Should the player choose to attack and then triumph in battle, they capture troops from the opposing army. However, if the opposing army is much larger than the player's army, the player may greet them peacefully but still receive troops as a gesture of a goodwill from the more powerful player.</p>\n<p>Once the greeting/attacking phase of the game is over, the player then proceeds to the main plot of the game, where they are a Monarch seeking to conquer and unite the world. There are 20 countries that the player may conquer, with different leaders, different opposing troop attributes/abilities, and a gradual increase in troop strength. Some countries contain natural resources that the player may then use to upgrade their castle, increasing its rank and appearance. There are three different castle types: Medieval, Futuristic, and Shogun.</p>\n<p>Should the player conquer all twenty countries, they won't get long to enjoy their good fortune: they lose control of all the conquered countries, but maintain control of their massive army, meaning they can conquer the world (that is, replay the game) once more.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Flower Town</em> is a simulation game where the player seeks to earn the title of \"Master Gardener\" by growing 20 different breeds of plants in their garden. To do this, the player must collect StreetPass tags with their 3DS system, and each player encountered may influence what breeds and colors emerge from the player's flower pots. All breeds and colors are noted in the player's in-game journal, with up to 80 different breeds available in a wide variety of colors.</p>\n<p>To garden, the player must have a pot sitting in their garden with a seed planted in it. When they are ready, they can \"garden with friends,\" which is accompanied by an animation of each StreetPass-tagged Mii walking into the player's garden with a plant of their own and then watering the player's plant. Each \"watering\" results in the plant growing a little bit more and eventually blossoming; once the plant has flowered the each Mii then lets the player collect a seed from that plant. Seeds are hybrids of the player's plant and their guests' plant, with each flower carrying a total of 10 seeds. Once the flower has fully grown and all seeds have been collected nothing more can be done with the plant, and the player may move the plant to a plot in their garden for display, or sell it. Excess seeds may also be sold for in-game gold.</p>\n<p>Gold can be used to purchase new pots, seeds, plots, and decorative items from the shops. Pots, plots, and decorative items do not influence plant growth. Only common seeds are available from shops; rare seeds must be obtained from StreetPass tags. In the planter's shed, when the player is given the option to plant a new seed in the pot of their choice, they will be shown a \"planter's preview\" that shows an outline of possible outcomes (and pictures of guaranteed outcomes). They are also told the probability of obtaining a new breed or new color. Besides their aesthetic appeal and filling out journal entries, different breeds and colors also play a part in client requests from Ms. Blossom's shop. Clients will request a flower for a particular purpose or color, and the player must try to grow a plant that fits those criteria. Success in doing so nets payment and an item reward.</p>\n<p><em>Flower Town</em> is part of the <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/3ds/nintendo-3ds-included-games\">StreetPass Mii Plaza</a> collection of games, but must be downloaded separately at additional cost.</p>",

He is well-known for stealing precious paintings and returning them days later, never getting caught. His true motive can be traced back three years prior to the start of the game, where Raphael's father mysteriously disappeared and left him with a strange coin. Raphael found all of the paintings his father had stolen shortly afterward, replacing them with forgeries. As Phantom R, Raphael works to replace his father's forgeries with the original artworks, meanwhile hoping he will someday find his father again. </p>\n<p>At the start of the game, Raphael finds a lead in the form of a museum exhibit which is currently displaying a bracelet with the same symbol as that on his father's coin. As Phantom R publicly announces his intention to steal the bracelet, Raphael must deal with the unraveling of a mystery involving a hostile man who claims to be the historical Napoleon, a mysterious girl named Marie who seems to have some connection to him, and the whereabouts of his very own father that may put him in over his head.</p>\n<p><em>Rhythm Thief &amp; the Emperor's Treasure</em> is a mix of adventure and rhythm, following the story of a Parisian mystery. The player can explore various landmarks of Paris during their search for clues in a point-and-click style reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Professor+Layton\">Professor Layton</a>. Advancing through the plot may involve solving puzzles or, more frequently, completing a mini-game where Raphael must move to the beat. These games may make use of either the stylus or the gyroscope feature of the 3DS; depending on how closely the player has followed the rhythm, a letter rank will be given. Coins can be found throughout the city and used to buy items for use in a mini-game. Optional mini-games may also be found throughout the city, holding references to other <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/12/sega-corporation/\">SEGA</a> franchises.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Monster Manor</em> is an exploration game where the player is investigating a haunted house, battling ghosts and finding treasure as they go. As part of the StreetPass Mii Plaza, collecting StreetPass tags from other players is integral to the game. In order to explore each floor, the player must open up \"rooms\" by taking pieces from other Mii players, with the shape and size decided randomly and the color of the piece determined by the tagged Mii's shirt. Placing pieces of the same color next to each other creates larger rooms in the house, containing treasure chests and orbs. Better weapons and other bonus items may be obtained from treasure chests, while orbs can be used to upgrade the player's weaponry.</p>\n<p>Occasionally the player will encounter different ghosts, and must defeat the ghost in order to continue with the game. To attack they must fire their weapon, but they also have the option to defend against attacks by putting up a shield. Both actions drain the weapon's battery and the player must wait for it to refill (or use a backup battery) if they deplete it. Should the player lose, they must leave the manor and lose any other StreetPass tags they had waiting in the game, and can only return once they've loaded a new batch of Miis into the Mii Plaza. Occasionally, a guest Mii will assist the player in exploring the manor, battling alongside them. To proceed to the next floor, the player must locate the stairs, which are occasionally guarded by a boss ghost. The boss must be defeated to proceed upstairs.</p>\n<p>After 30 floors the player will encounter the boss Arzodius. Once defeated they may continue on for 20 more floors, encountering Arzodius again on the 50th floor. This represents the final battle of <em>Monster Manor</em>.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Bravely Default</em> is a role-playing game that follows the adventures of four heroes in the world of Luxendarc, as they journey to find and awaken four elemental crystals: wind, water, fire, and earth. The party consists of Tiz Arrior, a young man whose village was destroyed by a Great Chasm; Agn\u00e8s Oblige, the Wind Crystal vestal who seeks to awaken all four crystals at the urging of her cryst-fairy companion Airy; Ringabel, a devil-may-care cad with amnesia; and Edea Lee, a former Sky Knight who turned against her country and comrades in order to assist Agn\u00e8s with her quest.</p>\n<p>The game is considered a \"traditional\" Japanese RPG in that it sticks to classic mechanics such as accumulation of experience points, the equipping of weapons and armor, item usage, and turn-based combat. <em>Bravely Default</em> is heavily influenced by the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Final+Fantasy\">Final Fantasy</a> series, to the point where various spells and items are named identically to those in Final Fantasy (like Fire, Fira, and Firaga, or Phoenix Downs), and similar job classes. <em>Bravely Default</em> uses a job system where the characters are assigned a job class, and they earn \"Job Points\" in battle which go toward leveling up that character in that particular job. Each level brings with it new skills for the characters to use; the maximum job level is 14. Each job has a default ability assigned to the character while they hold that job; a secondary ability can also be selected from among the other jobs that have been unlocked. Skills can be equipped cross-job for each character as well. To unlock a job, the player must defeat an antagonist with that job class, either in the main story or through a side-quest.</p>\n<p>Combat is, on the surface, a standard turn-based system where the player selects actions from a menu for each character and then each character acts in turn according to their speed stat. <em>Bravely Default</em> distinguishes itself via its use of \"Brave Points\" (BP), with at least one given to each character every turn. To act, the player must spend a BP for that character. Choosing \"Default\" from the battle menu lets the selected character bank a point, to be used in future turns or to be spent on actions that may require extra BP. Choosing \"Brave\" as an option allows the character to act more than once per turn, with a maximum of four actions allowed. The character need not have BP banked to use the \"Brave\" option; extra turns are essentially bought on credit, paid back by not having character act for that number of future turns. In battle a player may also activate \"Bravely Second,\" which stops time and allows one character four actions (BP is not consumed). In order to use Bravely Second, the player needs \"Sleep Points,\" which are earned by leaving the 3DS system in sleep mode with the game still running. The player earns one point for every six hours the system sleeps, for a maximum of three points stored.</p>\n<p><em>Bravely Default</em> makes extensive use of the StreetPass functionality of the 3DS. Passing players are stored in the game, and can be summoned during battle to perform an action; the type and effectiveness of the action depends on how far the other player has gotten in the game, how much they've leveled up, the strength of their characters, and the skills they've learned. It does not cost anything to summon a friend, but that player cannot be summoned again until they have been tagged again via StreetPass. <em>Bravely Default</em> also features a mini-game to rebuild Tiz's home village of Norende; StreetPass-tagged players are added to the village's population and can be used to help rebuild the businesses in Norende. Rebuilt businesses will give the players free items occasionally. The town also comes under attack from monsters generated by StreetPass visitors; these monsters can be battled at any time and yield generous XP, JP, and items.</p>\n<p>The Western versions of <em>Bravely Default</em> are localized from an updated version of the original release, with the update called <em>Bravely Default: For the Sequel</em> in Japan. This version features several enhancements to the original, such as more save slots, auto-battle, the ability to set the random encounter rate, improved interfaces, and a story event viewer.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Professor Layton and the Azran Legacy</em> is the sixth game in Professor Layton series, and the third game in the second (prequel) trilogy. Continuing on the story of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/52417/professor-layton-and-the-miracle-mask/\">Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask</a>, Layton and Luke are in to crack their brains on yet another 150 puzzles of all kinds while trying to uncover the secrets of the ancient Azran civilization that predates everything known to mankind. In the cold snowy rural area, beckoned by and old colleague, professor Sycamore, Layton, Luke and Emmy arrive to uncover the mystery of a living mummy, which in turn appears to be a resident of a lost Azran civilization, a young girl called Aurora. But the criminal organization known as Targent is also on to get her and everything Azran-related, and they'll stoop to anything to make it happen, putting Layton and his friends in constant danger and fight for their lives.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is similar to its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/52417/professor-layton-and-the-miracle-mask/\">predecessor</a>, and the first Layton game for 3DS, but this game includes more dynamic and action sequences, and not just through the cinematics, some of which require puzzle-solving in real-time (i.e. puzzle-fight mini-game trying to shoot down enemy missiles and drones launched at your airship). Hunting for hint coins is just as before, but there are many animated features on actual location sets which was not used in the previous game (i.e. you click on a water hose which starts sprinkling around and tosses something off which reveals a hint coin). There are new and recurring characters in the story, and almost all of them will have some puzzle to offer in a typical Layton sense.</p>\n<p>Layton's journal, list of mysteries, unlockable episodes that show sliced events with other characters, and collectable items are unchanged. However, mini-games and additional items are all new. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>World Times - which basically contains a collection of interesting articles about events happening around the world written by one of the female NPC who is a reporter</li>\n<li>Dress Up - mini-game where you have to make clothes for a client based on what they want to look like (i.e. cute, trendy, formal, casual or glam), the affinity of each aspect is marked in up to five stars, and each clothes piece will affect in positive or negative way one of the five categories, plus characters themselves might have additional wish such as preferring specific color range for a particular item</li>\n<li>Nutty Roller - mini-game where you control a small squirrel which is on an elevated area and can push boulders and nuts downwards with the main goal of trying to put the nut inside the tent (additionally, certain seeds can be used to throw in the holes to grow a tree and make an obstacle that way)</li>\n<li>Bloom Burst - mini-game where you try to water all the trees and make them bloom, on a maze grid-set where you have limited number of reachable blocks you can place (some can reach horizontally up to 3 blocks on each side, some can reach 1 block on every side, even diagonally, etc.), with a goal to reach every tree (additionally perfect goal is to try and cover entire maze), but there are poisonous mushrooms that if watered will create a negative effect so you may on occasion have to try and work around them</li>\n</ul>",

Arino has been sent back to the 1980s and has lost his memory, remembering only his love of classic video games. The only way to recover and return to his own time is by playing video games and completing challenges. And of course, you're there to help him a little -- or in other words, play everything for him while he sits and comments on how you're playing.</p>\n<p>The story mode is broken into chapters -- one for each featured game -- where the player can wander around the small town and speak with various characters, who are all based on and voiced by cast or guests from the TV show. Each of the featured games is a brand new \"faux-retro\" game made to look like an old 8- or 16-bit video game, from a wide variety of genres including maze games, platformers, shooters, and even a full-fledged RPG. There are also a number of side games including Game &amp; Watch-style LCD games, marble labyrinth games, and even the 10-yen medal games commonly featured on the show's arcade trip segments, for a total of over 15 games.</p>\n<p>In addition to the story mode, there is also a free mode where any unlocked game can be freely played, an ad-hod multiplayer mode for the games that support it, and a dictionary mode where famous quotes and terms from the TV show are explained.</p>",

Like in its predecessor your mission is to guide Yoshis while protecting baby Mario and deliver him to his real parents. After the stork delivered the Mario brothers the wrong house, before it could correct its terrible mistake, Kamek emerges from the sky to kidnap the babies again. But Kamek doesn't realize that Baby Mario has fallen and landed on a beautiful floating island, home of Yoshis who lived happily on it until the day that baby Bowser and his whole gang decides to spend vacation in this amazing egg island that had now become a dangerous place, especially for such a young baby as little Mario that begins his journey in search of her little twin brother, Luigi that is in the hands of the evil Kamek.</p>\n<p>This is a side-scrolling game that brings back the gameplay from SNES games to Nintendo 3DS in a new adventure with paint-style colorful graphics. The dynamic of the previous game is preserved: you control Yoshi, avoiding being touched by the enemies trying to capture Baby Mario, who rides on the back of Yoshis through the stages on Egg Island.</p>",

The most notable change is a revamped visual style, turning the 2D of the original into a 2.5D mode with the environment and the sprite characters remade in a high definition 3D polygon objects with dynamic lighting. It also has a distinct change in overall design with much more detail, replacing visual elements entirely, as a moving block now becomes an electric elevator for instance, water is animated, and basic platforms become statues. It also has a dynamic camera systems that zooms in or out automatically to give a better view. Optionally the game can still be played in a classic mode with the original 2D sprites in the 3D world.</p>\n<p>The game's soundtrack has been remixed by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/637077/dustin-kulwicki/\">Dustin Kulwicki</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/340789/danny-baranowsky/\">Danny Baranowsky</a>. The overall game design is nearly identical, with small tweaks to make the platforming a little easier and with more health pick-ups. The base game is extended with four additional levels, based on designs of an unreleased beta of the original game. This new area also adds a few characters, a new weapon and references from franchises of publisher NIS, such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Prinny:+Can+I+Really+Be+the+Hero?\">Prinny</a> in the Western version and references to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Crazy+Climber\">Crazy Climber</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dragon+Slayer\">Dragon Slayer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/52200/ikki/\">Ikki</a> in the Japanese version. Players can also unlock the Sanctuary Time Attack mode.</p>\n<p>It does not have all the content of the previous versions however. The soundtrack player of the Nintendo DSi version is not included and it also does not carry over most of the additional content of the 2010 WiiWare version or the 2011 <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Cave+Story%2B\">Cave Story+</a>, such as the improved version of the 2D graphics. The new unlockable Wind Fortress area with the new enemies and bosses, and the Nemesis Challenge (<em>Cave Story+</em>), and the two game modes Boss Rush and Curly Story (<em>Cave Story+</em> and the WiiWare version) are also not present.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Cave Story</em> is a re-release of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Cave+Story\">Cave Story</a> and meant to replace the 2010 DSi version. As technical limitations prevented it from being provided as a free update, it was released as a new game. This version does not incorporate the re-drawn look of the 2010 Wii version or the 2011 PC version <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Cave+Story%2B\">Cave Story+</a>, nor does it carry over the very different 3D makeover from the 2011 3DS game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/67168/cave-story-3d/\">Cave Story 3D</a>. The game was reworked to fit the higher 5:3 widescreen screen size and has the stereoscopic 3D effect. This makes it easier to distinguish elements in busy environments, but optionally it can be scaled back to the original 4:3 resolution.</p>\n<p>Contentwise there are a few small tweaks. The in-game map is no longer visible at the bottom of the screen all the time, encouraging the player not to rely on it too much. It is also possible to customize the controls, flipping jump and shoot buttons for instance. The game incorporates the additional content of the WiiWare and + version with the modes Boss Rush, Curly Story, and Sanctuary Time Attack (WiiWare and <em>Cave Story+</em> versions) and the new unlockable Wind Fortress area with the new enemies and bosses, and the Nemesis Challenge (<em>Cave Story+</em>). It includes the reindeer and vampire sprite swaps from the WiiWare version, but not the holiday themed content from <em>Cave Story+</em>. It also contains the jukebox option from the DSi version.</p>",

Flynn and the Skylanders set to get Cali and the statue back from Moneybone's hands.</p>\n<p>The 3DS version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Skylanders:+Swap+Force\">Skylanders: Swap Force</a> has a gameplay similar to its console counterpart: the chosen Skylander character goes through levels with different branching paths and gathers gold and experience along the way. However, the levels and setting are completely different, and the Skylanders have slightly different sets of abilities, and can double jump. Each level has three stars to be earned: one from completing the level, one for completing the level within a set amount of time, and one for completing all the level challenges, including gold and treasure chest collecting, and Element and Swap Zone challenges. The Swap Zone challenges are completely different from the console game's challenges, and consist of a part of the level in which special abilities tied to each Swap Force member's Swap Zone Power can be used to complete puzzles and defeat enemies.</p>\n<p>The wireless Portal of Power is used only to import Skylanders in the game from the portal in the game's hub, Boom Town, and to sync the figures to their 3DS counterpart, transferring the experience gained from one version to the other. The gold gained in the levels is automatically transferred into experience points once the level is finished, and characters abilities are unlocked as the characters progress rather than through upgrades. Like in the previous 3DS Skylanders games, the gold earned is converted into experience points once the level is cleared.</p>\n<p>The Starter Pack includes:<em> </em>Skylanders: Swap Force* game (with wireless Portal of Power)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/67840/skylanders-swap-force-rattle-shake/\">Rattle Shake</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/69222/skylanders-swap-force-free-ranger/\">Free Ranger</a></li>\n<li>Volcanic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/69105/skylanders-swap-force-lava-barf-eruptor-series-3/\">Eruptor</a> (exclusive color-variant version)</li>\n<li>Three character trading cards</li>\n<li>Three character sticker sheets</li>\n<li>A <em>Skylanders: Swap Force</em> collector's poster</li>\n</ul>",

However, there is a secret curriculum at this school, sponsored by the national government, to train promising young candidates in shinobido -- the way of the ninja. Of the more than 1000 students at the academy, five cute young girls have been selected for this program to become agents of justice for their country. But not all ninja work for just and righteous masters, and their struggle against evil -- not to mention with everyday teenage life -- has only just begun.</p>\n<p><em>Senran Kagura</em> is an action beat-'em-up game starring a team of ninja-in-training high school girls. The story is broken up into missions, which generally involve beating up on waves of enemy ninja in classic side-scrolling fashion, with various other objectives depending on the stage. It is possible to switch between the five members of the team between missions; however, some missions can only be tackled with specific characters.</p>\n<p>Each girl has their own unique sets of combos and attacks, earns experience and levels up separately, and can be dressed up in numerous unlockable outfits. Outfits take damage and can be destroyed in battle, which affects the character's abilities; there is even a special \"inochigake\" (\"life on the line\") state where the character rips off their own clothing, granting them a boost in attack power for a short time, and giving additional bonuses if a mission is cleared in this state.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>SoniPro</em> is a management simulation and rhythm game featuring Nitroplus' mascot character Super Sonico. It plays much like a combination of the earlier <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=SoniComi:+Communication+with+Sonico\">SoniComi</a> and Namco's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=The+Idolmaster\">The Idolmaster</a>. The player takes the role of a young producer at a talent agency who has been tasked with developing Sonico's talents, image, and career. While she may be a beautiful young girl with a great singing voice and skill with a guitar, she is still inexperienced, rather naive, and lacking in confidence, and as such needs proper guidance to become a real star.</p>\n<p>The game is broken up into three distinct sections. The bulk of the game is spent in conversation mode, where the player speaks with Sonico and the other characters, as well as plans her schedule and events. Quite often there are dialogue choices which will influence Sonico's progress and character, which in turn leads to different types of job requests. There are also two types of events; Live Events and Gravure Events. Live Events are a live performance of a song, which plays out like a simple rhythm game, while Gravure Events involve taking photos of Sonico in different outfits, and giving her instructions on how to pose. Performance in each of these sections also determines Sonico's popularity and influences her career.</p>\n<p>There are also Free Live and Free Gravure modes available, where the player can simply enjoy the unlocked content for fun without without worrying about specific requests or career progress.</p>",

        "description": "<p>When darkness came to the Radiant Isles, Hektore came with it, enslaving the Mystic Seekers and forcing them to create a mirror that would shroud the Radiant Isles from the rest of Skylands. With their task done, Hektore imprisoned them in various areas of the Isles. Only two Seekers, Fargus and his son Wendel, remained, waiting for a Portal Master who could bring the Skylanders to the Radiant Isles to face Hektore.</p>\n<p><em>Spyro's Adventure</em> for 3DS is a companion game for the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/55612/skylanders-spyros-adventure/\">Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure console game</a>. The player takes the role of a Portal Master who will have Wendel summon two Skylanders at a time to gather the Radiant Crystals needed to remove the veil from the Radiant Isles, free the Seekers, and get rid of Hektore. The game has a hub, a Sanctuary hidden from Hektore, from which the different areas of the Radiant Isles are accessed. Each area has a number of platforming levels to be completed in order to advance through the game. The main goal of the levels is to find the Radiant Crystal, then flee from Hektore who will pursue the Skylanders until they reach the end of the level. The time allotted to flee is limited, and Hektore will start firing laser beams once the timer reaches 30 seconds. Once the main challenge is cleared, other challenges such as Elemental challenges that require a Skylander of a specific element, crystal (the game's currency) gathering challenges, chest-opening challenges and so on, will be unlocked, each rewarding an additional Radiant Crystal. A final Hektore challenge, a race against the clock, becomes available once all the other challenges in a level are completed. The Radiant Crystals have a similar role to that of the Stars in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3533/super-mario-64/\">Mario 64</a>, as a certain number of them is required to unlock new areas and progress through the game.</p>\n<p>In this game, all the Skylanders from the console version can be imported using a wireless Portal of Power, but only two of them can be imported at once. In addition to their regular attacks, the Skylanders can jump and perform a double jump, as well as run for a short time. As they fight through the levels and gather crystals, they will gain experience and improve their abilities, which are gained by leveling-up rather than through an upgrade system. Each Skylander can reach up to level 10, and the experience gained is added to the figure's level. At the end of each level, the collected crystals are transferred into experience points distributed to both Skylanders.</p>\n<p>The Starter Pack includes the <em>Spyro's Adventure</em> 3DS game as well as the following:* <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/67849/skylanders-spyros-adventure-dark-spyro/\">Dark Spyro</a> figure</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/67358/skylanders-spyros-adventure-ignitor/\">Ignitor</a> figure</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/67436/skylanders-spyros-adventure-stealth-elf/\">Stealth Elf</a> figure</li>\n<li>Three character cards and sticker sheets</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p>After the unconventional side-scrolling and 2D platforming that was <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/27544/super-paper-mario/\">Super Paper Mario</a>, the <em>Paper Mario</em> series returns to its roots in <em>Paper Mario: Sticker Star</em>...at least when it comes to overworld movement. In the first handheld title in the subseries, the citizens of Decalburg are celebrating the Mushroom Kingdom's national holiday the Sticker Fest, where everyone gathers together at night to watch the Sticker Comet descend to the planet, which happens annually. Legend states that the Sticker Comet grants everyone's wishes, and Princess Peach is on stage to present it to Mario and some Toads. But Bowser Crashes the party and attempts to steal the comet. When some Toads try to stop him, the comet is accidentally shattered into six pieces, one landing on Bowser's head, causing him to gain immense power. Knocked unconscious, Mario is joined by Kersti, a sticker fairy from a place called the Sticker Star. She gives him some special abilities, and they set off to recover the pieces of the Sticker Comet.</p>\n<p>Unlike the other games in the series, Mario is the only real playable character, his only true companion being Kersti. The free combat seen in <em>Super Paper Mario</em> is abandoned in favor of encounters like those seen in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5498/paper-mario/\">Paper Mario</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Paper+Mario:+The+Thousand-Year+Door\">Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door</a>. However, battles are different: attacks and defensive moves are now done via stickers (such as jump and hammer stickers) that vary in power. There are also \"Thing stickers\" that summon 3D objects that can be used either in battle or the field. There is also the \"Paperization\" ability. If something doesn't look right, such as an upside-down background, Mario can turn the screen into an image and peel the object off like a sticker and turn it to the correct angle. Sometimes he will also find objects missing, with a dark purple void shaped like the object. He must find the \"Paperized\" object and place it there to progress. Another new addition is the Sticker Museum, where the player must place every kind of sticker, both battle and Thing, to complete.</p>",

The basic formula is unchanged since <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Super+Smash+Bros.:+Brawl\">the previous title</a>: up to four characters, controlled by either human players or the computer, duke it out in a side-scrolling arena. As characters take damage, they are sent flying further by attacks, and if they fly -- or fall -- out of the arena, then they're out!</p>\n<p>Most of the fighters from previous entries have returned, along with numerous newcomers, including <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/586/mega-man-rockman-games/\">Mega Man</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/132/pac-man-games-licensed/\">Pac-Man</a>, Little Mac (<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Punch-Out+series\">Punch-Out</a>), Shulk (<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/52226/xenoblade-chronicles/\">Xenoblade Chronicles</a>), Palutena (<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/6577/kid-icarus-series/\">Kid Icarus</a>), Villager (<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/4468/animal-crossing-series/\">Animal Crossing</a>), and numerous others for a total of more than three dozen playable characters. It is also possible to design a custom Mii-style fighter using parts and abilities unlocked throughout the game; this character can also be transferred for use in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/73359/super-smash-bros-for-wii-u/\">Super Smash Bros. for Wii U</a>.</p>\n<p>The game includes standard 2-to-4-player battle modes, including both time and stock matches, playable via either local wi-fi or internet play. New in this entry is the Smash Run mode, where each player must defeat enemies in a sprawling world map to collect upgrade items to boost their character's abilities. When the time is up, players then fight against each other with their upgraded characters. Returning from previous entries is the All Star mode, where the player must defeat all other characters in the game in order, with only limited healing items available. The trophy collection system introduced in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5575/super-smash-bros-melee/\">Melee</a> also returns, giving players a glimpse at classic and modern Nintendo characters and other objects in full 3D.</p>",

        "description": "<p><strong>Story</strong>  </p>\n<p>Level 5 and Capcom join their forces by combining their two independent franchises into a new game. Capcom's top defense attorney, Phoenix Wright with his assistant, Maya, as well as Level 5's duo for knack of solving puzzles, professor Layton with his assistant, Luke Triton. Professor Layton gets a mysterious visit which pulls him to a wild chase of witches an magic... something neither Layton nor Luke believe in. At the same time, Phoenix Wright arrives with his assistant, Maya Fey, to an airfield in London on a case. While English courtroom presents some slight differences in how Phoenix defends his clients, he still pulls it off as masterfully as ever. Both Phoenix and Layton, independently, find themselves reading pages from a book called Historia Labyrinthia where they appear to be the characters in. What's more, they magically find themselves transported to the world described in the book.</p>\n<p>Labyrinthia, a magical medieval city surrounded by tall walls, where magic exist and witches are being prosecuted and burned alive just for being what they are. Furthermore, Labyrinthia holds the Storyteller in high esteem, as he writes the story and events that transpire in the city, and what he writes cannot be altered. While Layton and Luke retain their memories, Phoenix and Maya find themselves working at the local bakery without remembering their life prior to being magically transported to Labyrinthia. When Espella Cantabella, a new friend of both Phoenix and Layton, is charged with being a witch, Phoenix Wright finds himself defending her in the courtroom where noone would ever dare to defend someone charged with being a witch. During the trial, while everyone laughs at a baker acting as a lawyer, ace attorney's memories try to surface and his top defense skills start to naturally appear in court, soon granting him the new name of Sir Blue Knight, due to his blue suit and sharp logic. As Phoenix and Layton both care for Espella, and want to find the way to return to their world, they team up in order to solve the mystery behind this place, uncover what witches are all about, and find a way home.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong>  </p>\n<p>Being a crossover of <em>Ace Attorney</em> and <em>Professor Layton</em> franchises, the gameplay contains everything from both worlds, though with some unique tweaks in gameplay. Bottomline, it's about exploration, solving puzzles, and defending a client in a courtroom. In <em>Professor Layton</em> series, Luke and Layton are always together and they comment on everything and solve puzzles together. This time, there are four protagonists, and throughout the course of the story the player will have different party of characters during the exploration, and even solving puzzles. While exploring areas and traversing a map, the player can click on various objects (often comments will be given in turn by each character in the current party), talk to character, stumble into puzzles (some obligatory, but most optional), and collect hidden coins. While coins were always used to unlock hints to solving puzzles in the past, here they can also be used to unlock hints during the trials, often providing an indicator on the witness' testimony where Phoenix needs to objects, and if there is an item that needs to be presented, half of the wrong items will be deselected to help with the selection of the right clue.</p>\n<p>Phoenix Wright is the only defense attorney here, and while everyone will get their hands on solving puzzles and exploring the town of Labyrinthia, only Phoenix gets to object in court. However, Maya, Luke, and Layton may be on his side of the bench to help with advice or ask some useful questions. Trials do consist of catching a witness in a lie or a contradiction with the clue at hand and presenting it to the judge. However, in this strange new land, accused aren't innocent until proven guilty, but rather guilty until proven innocent. Furthermore, several witnesses are questioned on the stand at the same time. This in turn adds a new feature where one of the witnesses can react to something the other witness said which lets Phoenix stop questioning the current witness and switching to another one to uncover more clues or gets to a new contradiction. Questioning multiple witnesses at the same time can also create contradictions between their own statements which too can be pressed on and objected. The game has full support for 3D screen depth, as is expected for a 3DS game, and features many animated cut-scenes which also have different depths and are comprised of animations within animations to give a more 3D feel to it. Voice-acting is present but is very limited and mostly appears during some key conversations. While this is not new for <em>Professor Layton</em> series where Luke and Layton had voice-overs since the beginning, for <em>Ace Attorney</em> series it's a fairly new experience since Phoenix never said anything more than \"Objection!\", \"Hold It!\" or \"Take That!\". Following the game's default dialogue speed and not exploring anything past what is required, the game still provides around 30 hours of gameplay.</p>",

        "description": "<p>K\u014dhei Fujimaru has started having strange dreams lately; dreams where one of his cute female classmates is locked in a room, and he is there only as a spirit who helps them escape. What's more, these dreams seem to be having an effect on the real world, subtly changing things around him when they take place. At the same time, the annual year-end school festival is fast approaching, and K\u014dhei can't decide which girl he wants to ask out!</p>\n<p><em>Onna no Ko to Misshitsu ni Itara \u25cb\u25cbshichau Kamoshirenai.</em> (loosely, \"If you're locked in a room with a girl, you might end up \u25cb\u25cbing.\") is a visual-novel style \"gal game\" combined with \"room escape\" style adventure game sequences. In the dream sequences, the player must help one of the girls escape a room or other situation; however, they cannot interact directly with either the girl or the environment, instead indirectly assisting in one of several ways.</p>\n<p>The main mode of interaction is by entering the name of an object to draw the girl's attention to it -- for example, \"wastebasket\" to throw away an empty can, or \"curtain\" to open a shower curtain. There are also sections where the player can blow into the microphone to send a gust of wind -- for example, to blow a dangling spider out of the way. Certain sections also allow the player to use the 3DS gyro to look around the room for different objects -- or just to get a better view of the girl they're ostensibly helping out.</p>\n<p>Between the escape sections, the game plays out like a standard visual novel. At certain points there are decisions that lead to several different endings.</p>",

        "description": "<p>After Cosmos' chosen warriors gathered Rhythmia and defeated Chaos, the balance in the rhythm of the world was restored. However, all things being in a cycle, Chaos regained his strength and Cosmos has once again summoned her champions to collect Rhythmia and vanquish Chaos.</p>\n<p><em>Curtain Call</em> follows in the footsteps of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/56953/theatrhythm-final-fantasy/\">Theatrhythm: Final Fantasy</a>, with new modes and characters as well as over 200 songs from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/176/final-fantasy-games/\">Final Fantasy franchise</a>, including scores and characters from, amongst others, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7197/final-fantasy-mystic-quest/\">Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/43866/final-fantasy-xiii/\">Final Fantasy XIII</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Final+Fantasy+XIII-2\">XIII-2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4522/final-fantasy-tactics/\">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Final+Fantasy+XIV:+A+Realm+Reborn\">Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Final+Fantasy+Type-0\">Final Fantasy Type-0</a>, or even the movie <em>Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children</em>. The player first chooses four characters to form a party that will be used to challenge the only mode available form the start, Music Stages mode, which consists of playing a single music tracks to get a high score; the remaining characters will have to be unlocked later by gathering crystal shards. Each party member can be equipped with up to four abilities that will trigger during the stages. These abilities need a certain amount of points to be selected, and the total points cost cannot be higher than each character's point limit. One of the game's new features is the Collecta Card Crystarium, which makes use of collectible art cards to boost the character's attributes.</p>\n<p>The same track types return from the original <em>Theatrhythm</em>: Field Music Stages (FMS), Battle Music Stages (BMS) and Event Music Stages (EMS), each with their own play variations. As notes appear on the top screen, the player may use the stylus, the buttons, or a combination of both in order to slide, tap or hold the notes in rhythm. Hitting a note perfectly makes a critical hit and gives more points. At the end of a stage, a critical chart shows how many of the notes the player has successfully hit as critical hits. A new type of notes, the Critical notes, allow the player to deal extra damage in BMS, reward treasure in EMS, or dash further in FMS if the note is hit perfectly.</p>\n<p>In FMS, the party leader travels in the chosen song's themed scenery and has to get as far as possible before the end of the song. Characters with higher speed will move faster and one with more endurance will take less damage if they stumble. Notes are displayed in a single line, with silver notes leading to a featured zone in which a chocobo replaces the character. The better the player performs in the featured zone, the faster the chocobo will be. If the player misses notes, the character will stumble and be replaced by the next one. The further a character gets, the more treasures will be rewarded. Some songs feature an airship rather than characters and chocobos. In those stages, the note lane moves closer and further from the screen as the song plays, making the lane seemingly go through changes in shape and speed. The notes also appear bigger or smaller depending on their position.</p>\n<p>In BMS, the screen has four lanes, each corresponding to one of the party characters. As the notes are played on each lane, the characters fight enemies that appear in the background, dealing damage as the player successfully hits notes. After sustaining a certain amount of damage, the enemy will be defeated and give way to the next one, sometimes a boss. Each enemy defeated has a chance of yielding treasure, so stronger characters who deal heavy damage are the most efficient. The BMS featured zone allows for a monster to be summoned and deal extra damage. If the player performs poorly during the featured zone, only a chocobo will be summoned.</p>\n<p>EMS are songs from key moments in the <em>Final Fantasy</em> games, with scenes from the game playing in the background. The note target moves around the screen following a path at varying speed, and the player must hit the notes accordingly. The EMS featured zone rewards the player with an extended version of the song when performed successfully.</p>\n<p>The game also includes a VS mode that can be played online, offline or against an AI opponent. In the VS mode, the player faces another team, each team fighting against monsters. Whichever team has the highest score by the end of the song wins. To gain the advantage over the opponent, the player fills an EX Gauge as notes are hits. This gauge triggers an EX Burst with various effects once it is full. Such effects include hidden notes that appear only when they are near the target, changes in speed, stronger enemies and judgement, which only counts the perfect critical hits, all the other hits being considered as bad. While under judgement, bad hits also take points from the player's score.</p>\n<p>The Dark Notes from the previous game have been replaced with the Quest Medley mode. The player must go through a branching path, completing various music stages and reach a final boss fight. The different areas include FMS and BMS, and can yield keys needed to access certain branches, be boss encounters or have save points from which the player will start again if the party gets defeated. The damage taken during the music stages carry on. Only healing magics and items used between stages can make the party recover. Each stage counts as one day, with tents being used to make additional days pass. As time progresses in a Quest, the experience rewarded by completing stages is increased. Airship passes can be acquired to move further and get to destination. The high scores and critical charts from the stages completed in Quest Medley are shared with those from the default Music Stages mode. Completing a Quest Medley unlocks additional quests of varying length that can be shared via StreetPass.</p>",

The game is played by lining up three or more Pok\u00e9mon in a row to create a Trozei. Making two or more Trozeis in a row will add combos. If the player lines up four Pok\u00e9mon and then three Pok\u00e9mon in the same combo, they get a Trozei Chance, meaning only two Pok\u00e9mon are needed to make a Trozei. Upon reaching a Trozei, the Pok\u00e9mon in the Trozei goes to the top screen. After a combo ends, the Trozeied Pok\u00e9mon attacks the wild Pok\u00e9mon. This will whittle down it HP. Trozeiing five or more Pok\u00e9mon in a straight line initiates a Scatter Attack, which attacks multiple wild Pok\u00e9mon. Six or more initiates the stronger Double Scatter Attack. Like the first game, Ditto can be used as a \"free space\" that can be lined up with any Pok\u00e9mon. Also, Trozeiing Chansey will restore HP to the Trozei Box. The wild Pok\u00e9mon will occasionally attack the Trozei Box. When its HP is gone, the game is over. However, when a wild Pok\u00e9mon loses all its HP, it can be caught and it will be added to the list of Pok\u00e9mon who may appear in the Trozei Box.</p>",

While it shares many events, it has more. It also features an exclusive Story Mode. The protagonists from the <em>Mario</em> and <em>Sonic</em> series team up to defeat Bowser and Dr. Eggman, who, along with their underlings, have taken over London. There are different parts to the story, depending on the character played. The player must win events against the antagonists. Playable characters consist of all 20 playable characters from the previous installment's Nintendo DS version, and are split into five groups of four.</p>",

The player hits the ball by aiming on an overheard map, and trying to time their power and shot accuracy. While easy to pick up and start playing, special techniques like limited power shots, the ability to use back and top spin, and the ability to curve shots around obstacles allow many different strategies. There are two main modes of play: Castle Club and Mario Golf.</p>\n<p>Castle Club mode is similar to the story mode from previous Mario Golf hand held games. In this mode, the players guides their Mii through different tournaments and challenges. As the players progresse, they earn coins, which can be used to purchase better golfing equipment.</p>\n<p>Mario Golf mode allows the player to play as different characters from the Mario universe, and compete in a variety of golf games and challenges, including stroke play, match play, and mini games that take place on courses. The mini game challenges require the player to complete certain tasks, such as hitting the ball through rings and then hitting the ball into the hole while still meeting par, or completing a course with 3 randomly selected clubs.</p>\n<p>An online mode allows play against other players in tournaments and match play. Local multiplayer with up to four people is also available.</p>",

Mega Evolution plays a major part of the storyline, and a new form change is introduced in the form of Primal Reversion, exclusive to Groudon and Kyogre.

Instead of roaming Hoenn after defeating the Champion as in the original, Latios automatically joins the player's party after summoning the player Southern Island. Latios can be used to soar through the skies of Hoenn, taking the player to locations known as Mirage Spots that cannot be reached otherwise.

In the game, the thieves from the movie have stolen jewels that the player must steal back. The player controls a goup of Pok\u00e9mon that must defeat the thieves' Pok\u00e9mon. The player chooses Chespin, Fennekin, or Froakie at the start of the game to be the group's leader. During each stage, the player sends out a group of Pok\u00e9mon to battle an enemy group. The A button sends out Froakie, the X button sends out Chespin, and the Y button sends out Fennekin. Defeated Pok\u00e9mon cannot be replenished untl the stage is completed, so the player must carefully send out only enough Pok\u00e9mon to defeat the enemy group. It is possible to sneak past enemy groups without getting caught, preserving the amount of Pok\u00e9mon in the player's group.</p>\n<p>The game is compatible with StreetPass, allowing the player to receive the Pok\u00e9mon that other players set as their leader.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Pok\u00e9mon Tretta Lab</em> is a utility to be used in conjuction with the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/69834/pokemon-tretta/\">Pok\u00e9mon Tretta</a>. It is used to catalogue the Pok\u00e9mon used in the game. The package includes a base for the 3DS to stand on and a scanner used to scan Tretta pucks to be attached to the top screen. The scanner has two spaces for placing Tretta pucks to be scanned. The actual software must be downloaded via a QR code that is included in the package. The game has three modes. In the Tretta Analyzer, the player scans in a Tretta puck and the game displays the contents, including the Pok\u00e9mon, type and stats. In Type Checker, two Tretta pucks are scanned and the game compares them, seeing how their types match up against one another. Finally, in Auto Battle, two Tretta pucks are scanned and the game plays an automatic demonstration of the two Pok\u00e9mon battling. The game is packaged with three exclusive Tretta pucks: Rookie promos of Mewtwo, Lucario and Eevee. First print runs also included an exclusive Pichu puck.</p>\n<p>There are two versions included in the package, their use depending on which model 3DS the player has: one for the original Nintendo 3DS and one for Nintendo 3DS XL. The utility is no longer supported as of Pok\u00e9mon Tretta's move to the X and Y series in March, 2014, and it is not compatible with the New Nintendo 3DS or later models.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Gates to Infinity</em> is the ninth game in the <em>Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon</em> series and the first for the Nintendo 3DS. The player is a human who has a dream about a Munna being chased by a Hydreigon and calling for help. The human then wakes up in a strange world and discovers they have been turned into Pok\u00e9mon, and starts plummeting down through the sky to the ground! When they wake up, they find another Pok\u00e9mon leaning over them and asking if they are okay. After introductions, the player accompanies this Pok\u00e9mon through a cave to a desolate plot of land, which the Pok\u00e9mon purchases. The Pok\u00e9mon tells the player their dream of creating a Pok\u00e9mon Paradise, and asks the player to help them. The player agrees and they become partners.</p>\n<p>The game is similar to previous entries in the <em>Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon</em> series, but there are several new features. The Pok\u00e9mon the player transforms into can be chosen by the player. The choices are Snivy, Tepig, Oshawott, Pikachu, and Axew. The player's partner can also be chosen, the choices being whichever four of those same five Pok\u00e9mon the player didn't become. The game is rendered entirely in 3D, and takes advantage the the Nintendo 3DS's built-in 3D capabilities. The game also utilizes the AR (Augmented Reality) features. By using the Ar feature on round objects, a portal called a Magnagate opens up. This means there is an unlimited amount of Mystery Dungeons that can be explored within the game. TMs (Technical Machines) can now be reused as much as the player wants, reflecting the change in their function in the main series <em>Pok\u00e9mon</em> games. Moves now have ranks, and will progress toward the next rank each time it is used. Another new feature is mini-games, which are hosted by Beartic. Depending on how well the player did, they may receive different prizes from completing mini-games.</p>",

Though their father has forbidden them to leave the castle, they still live a happy life with their four siblings. However, when they finally are sent to the outside world, it is on a mission to Hoshido, a peace-loving country that Nohr has plans to invade. There they learn that they were born to the Hoshido royal family, and were kidnapped by Nohr as an infant. A Nohr princess named Azura was taken hostage by Hoshido in retaliation, and has been living in a similar situation to the protagonist. With war looming on the horizon, Azura and the protagonist choose to side with their family in Hoshido, and defend it against the invading Nohr forces.</p>\n<p><em>Birthright</em> is one of three versions of <em>Fire Emblem Fates</em>, the others being <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/73728/fire-emblem-fates-conquest/\">Conquest</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/78596/fire-emblem-fates-revelation/\">Revelation</a>. In this version, the player controls their fully customizable avatar as they lead Hoshido's forces in strategic battles against Nohr-allied enemies. Gameplay is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Fire+Emblem+Awakening\">Fire Emblem Awakening</a>, with less challenging gameplay and the opportunity to grind for money, items, and experience in between storyline battles. In addition to the Classic and Casual modes featured in <em>Awakening</em>, this game contains Phoenix Mode, in which defeated allies are immediately resurrected on the following turn. Players pick one of these three modes at the start of the game, but may choose to permanently switch from Classic or Casual to a less difficult mode later on.</p>\n<p>Supports also return from <em>Awakening</em>, allowing characters to build their relationships as they fight alongside each other. Two characters of the opposite sex may get married and have children once their relationship has progressed enough, and <em>Birthright</em> also includes the possibility of a same-sex relationship if the player chooses the female protagonist.</p>\n<p>A feature called My Castle allows the player to build and customize a village that can contain various helpful buildings, such as shops that sell weapons or healing items. The village can be upgraded with resources collected through StreetPass, and it is also where StreetPass battles are held. Winning a StreetPass battle allows the player to recruit one of the defeated opponent units into their own army, and a shop in the village allows players to purchase other special units called Einherjard.</p>\n<p>Players may purchase DLC that allows them to play through the <em>Conquest</em> and <em>Revelation</em> scenarios as well.</p>",

An NPC named Professor Andy guides the player through 40 art lessons of varying complexity, each using a different Pok\u00e9mon as the subject. Several different art tools exist, including markers, pastels, and spray paint. Though lessons lock the player to the specific tools the game is currently teaching, a mode called Free Paint allows the player to use any tool in the repertoire to draw any Pok\u00e9mon they wish. This mode allows the optional use of reference images, which may be unlocked through completing lessons or downloaded during a limited time period.</p>",

Like all Picross games, the player must solve nonograms, where a picture is made by filling in squares on a grid within a time limit. Which squares are filled is determined by numbers on each row and column. The numbers indicate how many squares are filled in within that row or column. A wrong guess penalizes time. Too many wrong guesses, and the game is over. </p>\n<p>There are three modes: Easy, Normal, and Micross. Some puzzles will allow hints, such as checking if an entire row is correct, a navigation tool to check for mistakes, and a Hint Roulette, which randomly fills in a correct combination at the start of the game. For other puzzles, hints are unavailable. In Micross, which is a combination of the words micro and Picross, players must solve a huge puzzle on a grid of 80x80 squares.</p>\n<p>Each puzzle is a picture of a Nintendo character. Whole pages are dedicated to the Mario and Legend of Zelda series, and other puzzles include references to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/39578/devil-world/\">Devil World</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7469/excitebike/\">Excitebike</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Game+%26+Watch\">Game &amp; Watch</a>, among others.</p>",

When aliens attack the planet and kidnap Princess Ariana, it's up to Tempo and his friends to save their world and princess. Along with Tempo, the player may sometimes need to take control of the archer Lyra or the drum-and-cymbal-playing duo of Tyko and Cymbi, each of whom have slightly different playing styles.</p>\n<p>Regardless of which playable character is used, the basic gameplay mechanics are the same. Each level is set to a music track, and automatically scrolls. Every action the player takes adds instrumentation to the background music, with more successful actions producing richer sounds. As such, playing well is the only way to hear the level's music in full. The player needs to collect music notes, hit instruments as they appear, attack enemies, and dodge obstacles. Failing to perform the latter two tasks will result in the loss of a heart. If the player loses all their hearts, the level is failed.</p>\n<p>The game is composed of 54 main levels spanning 8 worlds, and 5 extra levels featuring music from the <em>Pok\u00e9mon</em> series of RPGs, which share a developer with <em>HarmoKnight</em>. Longer levels may feature one or more checkpoints.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures</em> is a 2.5D side-scrolling platform game based on the 2013 animated TV series of the same name. Just like the console/PC game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pac-Man+and+the+Ghostly+Adventures\">Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures</a> it is based on the series' storyline, but the gameplay of the 3DS version is entirely different and it is done by a different developer. Pac-Man and his friends Cylindria and Spiral receive a message from president Spheros that the Tree of Life with its special berries has been stolen and ghosts are attacking Pacopolis city. They decide to bring back the tree and fight the ghosts sent by Master Betrayus, the leader of the Netherworld.</p>\n<p>Pac-Man moves through a largely linear side-scrolling environment shown from a side view. He can move around, jump and bite to attack ghosts. Along the way he can eat cookies (dots) for points and 100 of them provides an extra life. Health is represented through hearts. Whenever he eats a ghost, he hovers in the air for a short time and by eating many in succession, next to each other, it is possible to climb in the environment. He can also float for a short time after jumping in the air. He can jump and cling to enemies, damaging them, until they can be swallowed. For larger enemies it is possible to bounce off them, making them flinch and susceptible to a clinging attack. Certain sections have cannons that launch Pac-Man in the air and allow him to break through blocks. Cannons can sometimes be rotated in multiple directions and are used to solve small puzzles. Next to enemies there are hazards such as gaps, floating platforms and electricity. A fast pace, attacking enemies in mid-air, is rewarded with more points. By eating dots of seven different colours valuable pieces of fruit appear. </p>\n<p>By picking up berry fertilizer a power berry that grows from a small potted plant will receive an upgrade. Graphic pieces can be picked up as well. Special attacks are provided by ingesting power pellets include a cold breath (stunning explosive blocks and enemies), using his tongue as a slingshot or to grab enemies, bringing enemies closers and the ability to transform into a giant rock. Many of these are also present in the main console/PC version. During certain sections it is possible to morph into Cylindria and Spiral, providing their Cherry Copter and Pineapple Tank respectively. Levels have a boss at the end requiring specific techniques. There are often small, animated cut-scenes, sometimes with conversation options.</p>\n<p>The game borrows some overall design elements from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Mega+Man\">Mega Man</a> series. After completing the first level all the other levels can be accessed right away and they are each based on the use of a specific power pellet type. After completing a level permanent access to that pellet type is provided as a new ability. Stages can also be revisited to find new paths and extras using the new powers required for certain sections. There is a set amount of powers for each level and it is possible to switch between them at any time, but with a time limit for each one.</p>",

Puzzles, as in all Picross games, are nonograms, which involve filling in squares on a grid to reveal a picture within a time limit. Numbers on the side of the grid determine how many squares in each row or column are filled in. Players can mark a square they have determined won't be filled in, and are penalized for filling in wrong squares by the removal of time left.</p>",

It keeps the same story as the original: while riding Epona through the Lost Woods in search of an invaluable lost friend, Link is ambushed by a Skull Kid and two fairies, who steal Epona and the Ocarina of Time. Upon catching up with them, Skull Kid turns Link into a Deku Scrub and flees, but one of the fairies, Tatl, is left behind and starts traveling with Link. Emerging in a new realm called Termina, Link is informed by the Happy Mask Salesman that Skull Kid has stolen a precious mask from him, the evil and powerful Majora's Mask. Link then learns that the moon is falling onto Termina's central city, Clock Town, and he only has three days to stop it.</p>\n<p>Aside from graphical upgrades, some story and quest related features are reordered, removed, or expanded, and a few new features are added, such as two Fishing Holes, one near Southern Swamp and another at Zora Cape. Boss fights are also altered, with new weak points added in the form of a large eye resembling those on Majora's Mask. Using the old strategies won't work this time. Saving is also different. Playing the Song of Time to return to the Dawn of the First Day no longer automatically saves the game. Instead, the game must be saved at Owl Statues, which no longer force the player to suspend gameplay, or Quill Statues, which can save the game, but can't be warped to.</p>",

Like its predecessors, it is a game that simulates cooking through a variety of recipes. Various steps in the cooking process are mimicked through simple mini games such as chopping, stirring, kneading, and tossing. Boasting 60 recipes and over 200 mini games, <em>Cooking Mama 4</em> utilizes the familiar DS touch screen feature along with the new gyroscope feature of the 3DS. The gyroscope gives players new abilities such as cracking eggs, flipping pans, balancing plates, and grating cheese. New recipes include corn dogs, cherry pie, and gourmet cupcakes. New activities are available after cooking, such as stacking plates, balancing cups, and washing dishes. There is also a cook-off mode, allowing up to 4 players to compete in perfecting new recipes. All modes in the game are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Let's Cook</em>: The game's basic mode, where the player can practice their skills by cooking various dishes alongside Mama.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Let's Combine</em>: Combine a basic recipe, such as pizza or curry, with another to create an all-new recipe. Fail a mini game and risk the chance of ruining the entire dish.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Let's Help</em>: Help Mama and her daughter, Ichigo, tidy up around the house by vacuuming, putting toys away, wiping the floor, taking out the trash, organizing the tableware, and more.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Let's Play Together</em>: The game's competitive multiplayer mode.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

Papa Blox's grandniece, Poppy, comes to visit his new Crashmo park in a \"hot air balloon\" which is actually kept afloat by birds arranged in a balloon shape. When Mallo introduces himself, he scares the birds away, which prevents Poppy from going home. Mallo volunteers to get the birds back.</p>\n<p>The target of each level is located on top of block formations called Crashmos. Mallo must get to the top to reach these goals. Therefore, he must push, pull, and slide the separate blocks to make those on top fall down in a formation that allows him to climb to the top. Blocks are largely independent of the blocks below them, so if the bottom blocks are moved, the top blocks will not move with them unless they are locked in position by the lower block. For example, if the upper block is simply sitting on top of the lower block, it will stay in place and eventually fall. But if the lower block has a formation holding the upper block on the side opposite of the direction it is being moved, the lower block will be pulled along with it.</p>\n<p>There is also a Crashmo Studio, where players can make their own Crashmo puzzles, and if they are solvable, make QR codes to share them with friends.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This entry in Nintendo's <em>Picross</em> series has players solve the eponymous puzzles, also called nonograms, to form an image of an object or creature from the <em>Pok\u00e9mon</em> universe. The usual rules of picross apply, but are also supplemented by the special abilities of the Pok\u00e9mon available within this game. Every time a puzzle is completed, its corresponding Pok\u00e9mon is captured and can be used in subsequent puzzles to provide special powers, including automatically fixing the first few mistakes the player makes, revealing several squares when the puzzle starts, and hinting at which row to work on next.</p>\n<p>Picrites are a form of currency introduced in the game. With them, players can unlock new areas, increase the number of support Pok\u00e9mon they can use per puzzle, and bypass the cooldown times assigned to Pok\u00e9mon abilities. An energy meter limits the number of squares a player can fill in before they need to take a break, and Picrites can be used to fill the meter, increase the max energy, and eventually remove the meter entirely. Although Picrites can be earned for free by finishing the daily training mode, earning achivements, and solving the main puzzles, additional Picrites can be purchased through the Nintendo eShop. There is a purchase limit of 5000 Picrites, at which point no more money can be spent on the game, and additional Picrites can then be obtained for free in batches of 1000 at a time.</p>\n<p>There are over 600 puzzles in the game. The basic, main set of puzzles is grouped into several different areas that can be traveled to.Sometimes, the player can earn a mural piece by completing a main puzzle under specific circumstances, which will unlock a new mural puzzle. These puzzles don't cost any stamina to play, but support Pok\u00e9mon cannot be used on them, and they do not award any Picrites. However, full completion of a mural board will unlock Primal Groudon or Primal Kyogre. Lastly, every main puzzle has a Mega Picross variant with more difficult clues to work out.</p>",

The player also has a random chance of being given free plays the first time they load the game on any given day.

It is based on the original game, but this enhanced release adds several new features. The game has been made less difficult by tweaking several of the game mechanics, for instance by allowing to change the EX Skill outside of class changing. Other novelties are the option to change the gender and re-fight bosses for an additional chance to get a better drop. Money can now be exchanged for experience to level up. During character creation three additional races are available. It also allows for custom avatars and offers the ability to re-colour the character appearance and costumes. Some of the early maps are redesigned.</p>",

This time, the player character ends up in Serene Village, where they are enrolled in the local school and meet a troublemaking classmate who becomes their close friend. The two eventually leave home to join the Expedition Society in Lively Town, where they begin to hear rumors of a malevolent force turning Pok\u00e9mon to stone. From there, the children begin an adventure that will not only decide the fate of the world, but reveal the truth of their mysterious pasts.</p>\n<p>New features in this game include stones called emeras, which can be placed into a held looplet to provide beneficial effects such as buffs and Mega Evolution. The series' bulletin board system for taking missions is replaced by the Connection Orb, which continually opens up new jobs as more Pok\u00e9mon are befriended. This also serves as the recruitment mechanic for the game, and allows the player to add main characters from past <em>Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon</em> games to their team.

This unleashes familiar Paper Mario characters and enemies into the 3D world. Bowser and Paper Bowser combine forces in an attempt to take over the Mushroom Kingdom for good. Mario, Luigi and Paper Mario must unite to stop two Bowsers!</p>\n<p>Although the game has turn-based battles, button commands can be pressed during battle to increase your attack, defend, and counterattack. This creates the sensation of a more interactive battle system compared to other games in the role-playing genre. The addition of Paper Mario brings new tactics to the regular Mario &amp; Luigi formula by being able to copy himself for both defensive and offensive purposes. Also new to the series are Trio moves. In battle Trio moves can be used to devastate your opponent. Out of battle they allow your party to dig under ground, grab distant objects, fly across gaps, and more.</p>",

Now in the present day, an amnesiac young man named Alto lives with his friend Lisette in a small village. When Hilda, the Witch of Destruction, attacks the village, she crystallizes everyone except Alto and Lisette, causing the latter to awaken her powers as the Witch of Water. Thus Lisette and Alto join the Regnant Knights, an organization that seeks to unite the Witches of Water, Fire, Earth, and Wind in order for them to sing the song that will break the crystallization spell Hilda has been attacking the nation with. Since Alto has the power of a Conductor, allowing him to awaken the Witches' songs, it's up to him to befriend the Witches and help them prepare for battle.</p>\n<p><em>Stella Glow</em> is a turn-based strategy RPG. Battles take place on a grid, and the player moves each unit individually in order to defeat enemies on the map and accomplish other goals. Each playable character has unique skills and abilities, and Witches in particular can sing to grant special effects that cover the whole map. During Free Time segments, the player can also spend time with other party members to build Alto's friendship with them, explore nearby areas, and take part-time jobs for extra money and items. Most importantly, this is when Alto can Tune a Witch, entering her heart to literally do battle with her inner demons. A successful tuning can unlock new songs to use during battle.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A youth has grown up as one of the royal children of the glory-seeking nation of Nohr. Though their father has forbidden them to leave the castle, they still live a happy life with their four siblings. However, when they finally are sent to the outside world, it is on a mission to Hoshido, a peace-loving country that Nohr has plans to invade. There they learn that they were born to the Hoshido royal family, and were kidnapped by Nohr as an infant. A Nohr princess named Azura was taken hostage by Hoshido in retaliation, and has been living in a similar situation to the protagonist. With war looming on the horizon, Azura and the protagonist choose to side with neither nation, and instead pursue a greater enemy in a third, hidden kingdom.</p>\n<p><em>Revelation</em> is one of three versions of <em>Fire Emblem Fates</em>, the others being <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/73726/fire-emblem-fates-birthright/\">Birthright</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/73728/fire-emblem-fates-conquest/\">Conquest</a>. In this version, the player controls their fully customizable avatar as they lead both nations' forces in strategic battles against the forces behind the Nohr-Hoshido war. In addition to the Classic and Casual modes featured in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Fire+Emblem+Awakening\">Fire Emblem Awakening</a>, this game contains Phoenix Mode, in which defeated allies are immediately resurrected on the following turn. Players pick one of these three modes at the start of the game, but may choose to permanently switch from Classic or Casual to a less difficult mode later on.</p>\n<p>Supports also return from <em>Awakening</em>, allowing characters to build their relationships as they fight alongside each other. Two characters of the opposite sex may get married and have children once their relationship has progressed enough, and <em>Revelation</em> also includes the possibility of a same-sex relationship regardless of the protagonist's gender.</p>\n<p>A feature called My Castle allows the player to build and customize a village that can contain various helpful buildings, such as shops that sell weapons or healing items. The village can be upgraded with resources collected through StreetPass, and it is also where StreetPass battles are held. Winning a StreetPass battle allows the player to recruit one of the defeated opponent units into their own army, and a shop in the village allows players to purchase other special units called Einherjard.</p>\n<p><em>Revelation</em> is only available as DLC for players of <em>Conquest</em> or <em>Birthright</em>.</p>",

The game allows the player to interact with a virtual pet by speaking commands into the microphone, and by simulating physical actions with the touch screen. The animals also respond to a familiar face by use of the system's camera, allowing your pets to respond to your presence and return. Some tasks will include fulfilling everyday pet owner responsibilities like feeding your pets, walking your pets, and showing them affection. There are also several toys that can be purchased for your pet that allow for all types of games like frisbee, tug of war, and fetch the ball. There are several commands and tricks to teach your pet, which if successfully done can lead to a trophy in one of the dog competitions accessible later in the game. Other new features found in this game over the previous Nintendo DS incarnation include the ability to take 3D pictures of your pets, and much improved network and communication features that allow you meet other virtual pets in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p>The <em>Toy Poodle</em> version of the game contains the following dog breeds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Toy Poodle</li>\n<li>Pembroke Welsh Corgi</li>\n<li>Mini Schnauzer</li>\n<li>Boxer</li>\n<li>Bull Terrier</li>\n<li>Labrador Retriever</li>\n<li>Shih Tzu</li>\n<li>Jack Russell</li>\n<li>Pomeranian</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, the game includes three types of cats; Siamese, standard and long-haired cat. The cats interact less to the player's commands, and do their own thing in comparison to the dogs' more obedient behavior.</p>",

Some tasks will include fulfilling everyday pet owner responsibilities like feeding your pets, walking your pets, and showing them affection. There are also several toys that can be purchased for your pet that allow for all types of games like frisbee, tug of war, and fetch the ball. There are several commands and tricks to teach your pet, which if successfully done can lead to a trophy in one of the dog competitions accessible later in the game. Other new features found in this game over the previous Nintendo DS incarnation include the ability to take 3D pictures of your pets, and much improved network and communication features that allow you meet other virtual pets in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p>The <em>French Bulldog</em> version of the game contains the following dog breeds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>French Bulldog</li>\n<li>Shetland Sheepdog</li>\n<li>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel</li>\n<li>Chihuahua</li>\n<li>Dalmatian</li>\n<li>Yorkshire Terrier</li>\n<li>German Shepherd</li>\n<li>Husky</li>\n<li>Basset Hound</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, the game includes three types of cats; Siamese, standard and long-haired cat. The cats interact less to the player's commands, and do their own thing in comparison to the dogs' more obedient behavior.</p>",

Local play allows use of the AR card included in the package (though not needed to battle).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>StreetPass:<br>\nAllows the set up of battles with other players through StreetPass.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>SpotPass:<br>\nAllows downloading of new Rabbids.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>QR Codes:<br>\nScanning QR codes can reveal new Rabbids, one is included in the manual.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Brief overview of the game play:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Battles (Story Mode and multiplayer):  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The battles consist of using a team of Rabbids to defeat your opponent. Each player takes turns using physical or special moves to reduce the hit points of the opposing character, or an item to boost a stat (damage, defense, etc.). After each battle you have the option of capturing the Rabbid(s) you were fighting. To capture a Rabbid, you must slap it; once added, the Rabbid is K.O.. K.O.'d Rabbids must be awoken by using bandages (gained through mini-games). After each round, Rabbids are awarded experience points, which allows them to learn better versions of their moves.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mini-games (Story Mode):  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each mini-game rewards you up to 3 microchips depending on how well you do. Microchips collected unlock the Boss Rabbid battle for the zone. Additionally bandages (which look like rolls of toilet paper) can be collected through mini-games.</p>",

It features familiar character classes and skill tree mechanics from Etrian Odyssey alongside a labyrinthine approach to the randomly generated Mystery Dungeons.</p>\n<p>As is traditional of Mystery Dungeon, the game takes place mainly in dungeons made up of randomly generated tile-based floors. For every action the player takes, including movement, attacking, and usage of items, all enemies on the floor will also take an action. Players can progress through the dungeons by finding the stairs located on each floor. Unlike most other Mystery Dungeon games, which use a linear dungeon floor structure, this game's dungeons feature multiple sets of stairs per floor that lead to divergent paths. Etrian Odyssey's F.O.E.s also make an appearance as D.O.E.s, large enemies that will move from floor to floor of the dungeon as they progress towards the surface. To protect the town of Aslarga that acts as the player's main camp, it is necessary to build forts and keep watch for these monsters.</p>\n<p>Going further through the various dungeons will grant access to stronger enemies, materials, and equipment and bring your guild closer to uncovering the mystery of Yggdrasil's dungeons.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Kirby: Planet Robobot</em> is a 2.5D side-scrolling platform game that uses traditional <em>Kirby</em> platform gameplay; the aim of the game is to guide Kirby towards the end of the level while utilizing his copy abilities to defeat enemies and interact with the environment. This time around, Kirby is defending Popstar from the corrupt Haltmann Works Company, which aims to mechanize the planet and steal its natural resources. The new gameplay mechanic introduced in this title is Robobot Armor, a mech suit with copy abilities similar to Kirby's own. The Robobot Armor is much more powerful than Kirby and can interact with obstacles that he may not be able to pass on his own, but its large size sometimes means Kirby will need to exit the suit and proceed on foot. In addition to the mech gameplay, Kirby has access to three copy abilities that are new to the series: Doctor, Poison, and ESP. All copy abilities can be accessed at will by scanning in compatible amiibos, including alternate costumes that can only be obtained through figures made specifically for this game.</p>\n<p>Alternate modes include <em>Team Kirby Clash</em>, an action RPG that supports up to 4 players; <em>Kirby 3D Rumble</em>, in which Kirby moves around an arena to defeat enemies as fast as possible while aiming for a high score; <em>Meta Knightmare Returns</em>, a speed-oriented mode in which the player controls Meta Knight through modified versions of the levels from story mode; and the <em>Arena</em> and <em>True Arena</em> modes that return from other platformers in the series.</p>",

        "description": "<p>'Disney Epic Mickey: Power Of Illusion' is a 2D action platformer and is a spin-off of the Epic Mickey series. It is a tribute to the Illusion series of Mickey Mouse games by Sega, and this game is mainly a tribute to 'Castle Of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse' for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis.</p>\n<p>The gameplay consists of controlling Mickey Mouse (with either the Control Pad or the Circle Pad) in a 2D side-scrolling environment akin to the Illusion series, while mixing the paint and thinner mechanics from Epic Mickey for the Nintendo Wii. Using the 3DS touch screen, players can paint objects to bring them to life (useful to get around, or reach heights) or use the thinner to erase them (particularly removing obstacles to help Mickey advance forward).</p>\n<p>Each stage is based on films from the 'Walt Disney Animated Classics' canon and involves the player rescuing certain characters (toons) from each stage relating to the film. Every time these characters are found, they are then kept safely in a fortress including a large number of rooms. Throughout the game, these characters may ask Mickey to carry out several missions (in which he'll get rewards in return). </p>\n<p>The game's graphics include hand-drawn sprites along with scrolling parallax backgrounds (which is a nod to the technique used in 16 bit gaming industry).</p>",

The stylus is used to talk to characters, collecting certain items needed throughout the tasks and activating objects around the streets. The upper screen displays the number of quests currently completed, the name of the street you're in, the number of marmalade sandwiches found (one of Paddington's favourite snacks!) and the current score. The game also includes a wide variety of minigames with players to test their skills.</p>",

After meeting a local boy named Hau and fending off Team Skull thugs, Sun and his Greninja participate in one of the region's traditional Trials in order to grow stronger. On subsequent adventures, he can battle local trainers, catch Pok\u00e9mon, and earn rare items. New scenarios open up to the player every few days after their initial completion of the demo.</p>\n<p>The Greninja used in this demo is based on the one Ash Ketchum owns in the <em>Pok\u00e9mon</em> anime, and comes with an exclusive ability that allows it to change form into Ash-Greninja. Upon completion of the demo, Greninja and several of the obtained items can be transferred to a <em>Sun</em> or <em>Moon</em> save file.</p>",

The game takes place in the Alola region, an archipelago whose culture, geography, and native wildlife are based on those of Hawaii. A number of Alola's native Pok\u00e9mon have never been seen before, bringing the series' total number of Pok\u00e9mon species to over 800.</p>\n<p>The story follows a customizable protagonist who has just moved to the region and received their first Pok\u00e9mon. What differs from past installments is that instead of the usual challenge of defeating eight Gyms, Alola is host to the island challenge, in which trainers face seven trials that test many other skills in addition to battling prowess. Only after clearing the seven trials and defeating the four island Kahunas can a trainer be called a champion. As the player character embarks on their island challenge, they are joined by a local boy named Hau, another newcomer to Alola named Lillie, and the mysterious Pok\u00e9mon Cosmog that is under Lillie's protection. The group is forced to deal with Team Skull, a group of thugs who commit petty crimes under the leadership of their ruthless boss; the Aether Foundation, a wildlife conservation group with connections to Cosmog; and dangerous, otherworldly creatures called the Ultra Beasts.</p>\n<p>As usual for a new pair of <em>Pok\u00e9mon</em> games, <em>Sun</em> and <em>Moon</em> boast a number of new and improved features. HMs are now replaced by Ride Pok\u00e9mon, which are unlocked over the course of the story and can be called upon at any time to provide transportation and clear obstacles. Hyper Training allows players to boost their Pok\u00e9mon's individual values, hidden values that impact a Pok\u00e9mon's potential for stat growth and are otherwise immutable. The new Battle Royal mode pits four trainers against each other in a free-for-all fight where the goal is to score the most KOs while trying not to let one's own Pok\u00e9mon faint. A group of islands called Pok\u00e9 Pelago allow the player's Pok\u00e9mon to play and collect items while they aren't in the active party, and each island can be upgraded to provide more and better rewards. Lastly, a location called the Festival Plaza acts as the multiplayer hub, and combines features from prior games' Join Avenue and PSS systems.</p>",

One can play with any off the previous Mario Party DS characters such as Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Wario, Daisy, Waluigi, Toad and the new character Boo. A secret ninth character can be unlocked by playing through one of the available game modes.</p>\n<p>The game is played on seven different boards (6 standard and 1 unlockable) and features 81 different mini-games in the so-called <em>Party Mode</em>, which also can be played \"without the use of a game board in the <em>Mini-Game Mode</em>. Island Tour also features AR and supports Streetpass, which can be used in the third mode: <em>StreetPass Minigames</em>. The fourth and final mode is <em>Bowser's Tower</em> in which players must play through 30 floors of minigames, with every 5 floors featuring a boss battle. </p>\n<p>The general concept of playing the game is still the same and does not much differ, compared to its previous iteration of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/33929/mario-party-ds/\">Mario Party DS</a></p>",

It has the same gameplay features as it's predecessor, solving nonograms in three dimensions. </p>\n<p><em>Round 2</em> features an extra difficulty with the possibility of two colored blocks present, which must be painted accordingly. <em>Blue blocks</em> represent normal square/straight blocks and the new <em>orange blocks</em> which transform into odd shaped and curved ones. The representation of <strong>both</strong> blue and orange blocks in a row or column is by the use of dual numbering. Penalties may occur when blocks are destroyed incorrectly or painted in the incorrect color. Flagging blocks in certain colors when one is unsure is now a possibility as well as bombing away complete rows and columns without blocks.</p>\n<p>Compatible Amiibo figures can be scanned to gain additional puzzles.</p>",

Even after the war ended, the world is still devoid of normality, with people killing each other, and Man being ruled over by both angels and demons.\nThe player takes control of the character Nanashi, who after being killed almost at the start of the game, is revived by the demon Dagda, in return for becoming Dagda's \"Godslayer\".</p>\n<p>The game then slowly directs the player through the usual Shin Megami Tensei alignment system, where decisions made will border on either Law, Chaos or Neutral routes, which will lead to a multitude of different endings.</p>\n<p>There are several key gameplay changes in this game, comparing it to its sister title, <em>Shin Megami Tensei IV</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The expanded partner system is the most obvious improvement, with Nanashi being able to have up to seven partners during battle (the usual 3 demons to fight alongside him, as well as 4 support characters, each with their own support gauge);</li>\n<li>Update to the negotiation system, where previously failed negotiations will start where they left off if you try them again, instead of simply restarting all over;</li>\n<li>Enhancements to magic usage, whereby demons specializing in a certain magic type will use it more efficiently;</li>\n<li>Also regarding magic, the light and dark spells of Hama and Mudo no longer have the possibility of instantly killing an opponent, they now deal damage instead;</li>\n<li>Complete overhaul to the UI, making it a lot more user friendly and aesthetically pleasing;</li>\n<li>New sound effects (like demon roaring).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some demon designs from the previous game were refined in this release, and the main character was given a teenager look in order to better fit the game's themes (instead of the original design, which made him look much older).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Spirit Camera: The Cursed Memoir</em> is a survival horror game and a spin-off from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Fatal+Frame\">Fatal Frame series</a>. The game utilizes the AR functionality of the 3DS to interact with the provided AR Notebook (\"<em>The Diary of Faces</em>\" (USA) / \"<em>The Purple Diary</em>\" (Europe)).</p>\n<p>The game starts with the player receiving the above mentioned AR Book, on which the player has a creepy and sinister feeling about the whole aura around the book. Creepy pictures, strange and cryptic words. Blank pages suddenly filling themselves with texts. The game can be generally categorized into three sections:</p>\n<p><strong>Story Mode (Diary of Faces/Purple Diary)</strong>: The main mode, in which the 3DS camera is used as <em>Camera Obscura</em> to find hints within the diary and battle ghosts in the real world environment around them. The main goal is to aid the trapped female ghost Maya in the diary and help her escape her troublesome fate. This mode is split up in sections, which can be accessed from the main menu when unlocked. Clearing Story Mode unlocks an outfit for Maya, Story Mode (Extra), and Battle mode.  </p>\n<p><strong>Story Mode (Extra)</strong>: This is a more difficult version of story mode, unlocked after clearing the standard Story Mode.  </p>\n<p><strong>Battle Mode</strong>: This mode after being unlocked is a mode in which the player can freely take photographs of the world around him and battle characters appearing in story mode. Clearing battles in this mode adds a new costume and new battles.  </p>\n<p><strong>Ghost Camera</strong>: This mode can be played in a total of three different ways. Using the 3DS' camera to take photos of the player's surroundings will result in images of ghosts appearing in the pictures. Players can also \"diagnose\" someone as being haunted, by taking a photo of the player or other people, which will reveal an image of the \"ghost\" haunting them. Players can also take photographs of their own face or the faces of others and put them onto a ghost's body.  </p>\n<p><strong>Horror Notebook</strong>: In this mode, the player must use the 3DS camera to search through the AR Notebook to find the ghost of the Masked Boy hiding within it, which will trigger a mini-game. The other known game in this mode is \"Curse of the Japanese Dolls\", in which the player must correctly identify the real doll out of a group, and photograph it to exorcise it within the time limit.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Solve pixel puzzles by tapping numbered blocks to extend them into lines. At the start of each puzzle most of the blocks on the screen are empty, while some are filled. Some of the filled blocks contain numbers, which indicate to the player the length of the line that must extend from them. The player must select a numbered block and a cardinal direction in which to extend a line. Each line will extend until it hits a filled block (such as another numbered block or line), exceeding the intended length, so the player must carefully extend lines in the correct order.</p>\n<p>Once all blocks have been extended, the colours and shapes of the lines reveal a pixel image. While recognising the image as it is revealed can help guide the player, only logic is necessary to solve the puzzle.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Captain Olimar wakes up after crash landing his ship, and realizing that the fuel supply is empty. After wandering about, he comes across some Pikmin hidden around, and eventually some Sparklium seeds, which are what is used as fuel for the ship, and thus, needed for escaping.</p>\n<p>In <em>Hey! Pikmin</em>, a spinoff of the <em>Pikmin</em> series, the player controls Captain Olimar, in a 2.5D side-scroller with puzzle elements, instead of the traditional 3D real-time strategy that the series goes by.</p>\n<p>Pikmin are found in the wild, and Captain Olimar can call upon them with his whistle, and then issue several different commands, such as throw them onto platforms, so they can remove obstacles and collect items. Olimar is controlled with the D-pad, while Pikmin are controlled with the stylus. As such, the game relies heavily on the touchscreen.\nEach Pikmin type has different abilities \u2013 for instance, blue Pikmin can swim, red Pikmin are resistant to fire, and yellow Pikmin are resistant to electricity. The player must then utilize different Pikmin to suit different situations.</p>\n<p>Captain Olimar has a set of green bars depicting his health, which are depleted by simply bumping into enemies, instead of just by enemy attacks, like in previous games.</p>",

        "description": "<p>On your 16th birthday a letter from your grandmother arrives, containing a note and a key. This magic key unlocks the plastic door of a diorama, and out steps a doll-sized girl. After talking to the girl Sophie she realizes that your grandmother was the fashionista known by everyone in her town as the woman who could make people happy with fashion. She then invites you back into her world, to see the clothing store grandma used to run.</p>\n<p><em>Syle Savvy: Fashion Forward</em> is a further expansion of the <em>Style Savvy</em> series, containing the same dressup gameplay as past entries with new features to free your inner stylist. The core gameplay, and money-making component, is still based around selling clothes from the boutique. Customers browsing the boutique can be talked to to see what item they are looking for. If the player accepts the request they're taken to the backstock, where they try to match the customer's request, and the style of their other clothing. Customers all have a budget too, but can be persuaded to go slightly over it if they fall in love with the item. A customer's first request will be for a single item, but once they trust the player enough they will request a complete outfit, with a higher budget to match. All of the store's inventory has to be purchased beforehand by the player, which they will get at the Exhibition hall. Each clothing brand, who all specialize in a particular style, has a store in the hall, with a selection that rotates daily and is seasonal. Whenever a new item is purchased the player also receives a personal copy of it for their wardrobe. The interior, exterior, and window display of the boutique can all be customized, and will determine what sort of customers are attracted inside.</p>\n<p>In addition to the boutique there are also a variety of side-jobs that can be taken on, such as the beautician, hairstylist, and modeling studio. The beautician and hairstylist take requests from customers the same as the boutique, and successful makeup and haircuts can be saved for future use. At the modeling studio the player can select from available gigs, put together an appropriate outfit for the job, then go on location to get the pose and shot that evokes the customer's demands. The game can take 2d or 3d screenshots at any time, and beyond just saving memories these photos can be given to the color expert and makeup kit designers to inspire them. New colors unlocked this way can be used for makeup, hairdye, and clothing design dyes.</p>\n<p>Dressup, makeup, and hairstyling all come together for the fashion show, where the player has to match a theme with multiple outfits. If the fashion show goes well new customers will come into the shop, looking for a complete makeover from the local celebrity herself.</p>\n<p>After completing the main storyline the clothing brands will be so impressed by the player's style sense that they will commission limited runs of new clothing. Each request will be for a specific kind of item, such as a bridal dress or a clutch, and then a requirement for the item's design. By talking to people in town the player can learn new patterns and accessories, and once a request is completed that same clothing style will be unlocked to make custom designs on the player's dime.</p>\n<p>A new feature for <em>Fashion Forward</em> is the dollhouse, a magical building that turns doll furniture into full-size rooms. Each dollhouse room can be customized to the player's wishes, or designed around a theme, like cafe or boutique. New doll furniture can be purchased or received as gifts from characters in town, and if a room is impressive enough characters may ask to rent it.</p>\n<p>If Streetpass is activated the game will share a selected dollhouse room with other 3DSes. The game also supports Amiibos, and scanning Amiibos from select (mostly female) Nintendo characters will summon a customer based on the system's Mii who is looking for an outfit to match their style. Completing their request will reward a unique item, like a Kirby purse or Lucinda's skirt, to the player's wardrobe.</p>\n<p>The Japanese version of <em>Fashion Forward</em> had free, monthly updates that added seasonal clothing as well as clothing based on actual clothing brands. For the European and North American release the majority of seasonal items were rolled into the base game, and the licensed clothes not included. Unlike <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Syle+Savvy:+Trendsetters\">Trendsetters</a> the boutique will not get male customers, but once the main storyline is completed the menu will have an option to dressup any male character in the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Kirby\u2019s Blowout Blast</em> is based on Kirby 3D Rumble, which is a mini-game in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/80095/kirby-planet-robobot/\">Kirby: Planet Robobot</a>. The game follows the same mechanics as the original <em>Kirby</em> game, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5335/kirbys-dream-land/\">Kirby's Dream Land</a>, meaning there is no copy ability, like in future iterations of the series. The main difference in <em>Kirby\u2019s Blowout Blast</em> is the introduction of the 3D environment, which changes the gameplay around. For instance, Kirby can now spit enemies he has swallowed in several different directions, with the introduction of a small arrow to indicate the direction Kirby will spit the enemy out.</p>\n<p>Even though the game is fully playable in 2D, the use of the 3D gimmick gives the world a much greater sense of depth, and can sometimes help with the gameplay, just like it happened in Planet Robobot.</p>\n<p>Each completed stage awards the player with bonus points, depending on how fast the stage was finished, how many enemies were killed, if all coins were collected and if damage was avoided. A gold ranking (or higher) will unlock the EX versions of the corresponding world, and since there are initially five worlds to beat, obtaining that rank in each single world will double the game\u2019s length, making 10 worlds available.</p>\n<p>Kirby themed Amiibo work with the game, unlocking several cosmetic extras. Other extras are also unlocked by having <em>Kirby Planet Robobot</em>.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>SPEC</em> is a text-adventure game based on the TV drama series with the same name, featuring the same actors from the TV series. Most of the game resembles a typical visual novel showing static characters in different poses and expressions over background with on-screen text to indicate dialogues with included voice-acting. Unlike in visual novels where both background and characters often use anime art, this game uses actual locations and live photos for both locations and characters. The bottom, touch screen, is used to enter player's responses during dialogues, check conversation log, adjust the game settings, save the game or check the tips and hints section.</p>\n<p>The story takes place between episode 4 and 5 of the TV drama and features Takeru and Saya as the protagonists. The SPEC is a special police investigation branch that focuses on catching people who abuse their supernatural abilities. The story, as such, takes place in slightly altered version of the real world where people with special abilities exist, and those abilities are not clearly visible to anyone else unless the person who has a special ability uses it. Takeru and Saya, a team of two young detectives, confronts the criminals who use their special abilities to do evil deeds.</p>\n<p>Initial print release included a download code for new scenarios which can also be purchased via in-app after completing the main story. Additionally, the game includes a retro mystery adventure game which uses 8-bit graphic and controls similar to old Famicom (NES) adventure games with static image depicting location on one part of screen, and the other containing a list of actions player can perform to either investigate the location or talk to other characters.</p>",

Nintendo answers this question by officially providing 100 remastered minigames spanning from the first through tenth main installments. This game focuses more on the minigames already created rather than the main board game aspect or storyline.</p>\n<p>In \"100 Minigames,\" the player can select one of minigames to play. At the start, only some of the 100 are available. \"Minigame Island\" enables the player to unlock additional minigames by progressing through four sections of the entire map. \"Minigame Match \" has players compete in a small game board, while still emphasizing the minigames. In \"Championship Battles,\" players can compete for the most wins in three or five minigames. \"Decathlon\" allows players to test how well they do overall in five or ten certain minigames. \"Collection\" lets players look at what they won or unlocked, between music, artifacts, and characters. \"Play with Friends\" helps players enable local multiplayer experiences, either with one or all players containing a cartridge.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>K\u014denji Joshi Soccer 3</em> is the third game in the soccer-themed visual novel focusing on the girls-only soccer team of Kouenji Academy. The story takes place seven years after the events that took place in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/76005/koenji-joshi-soccer-2-koi-wa-never-give-up-koenji/\">K\u014denji Joshi Soccer 2</a> where the player's team won the world championship. Now that team is a legend and talk in school, but it is becoming the thing of the past and the soccer team is about to be abolished. The player takes on a role of a newly transferred coach who has been given an opportunity to assemble a new team and train the girls to win the tournament.</p>\n<p>While being focused on soccer on training, the game gives you a one day event that lets you make private memories with each of the heroines. The story unfolds from April to January and is being split into monthly events where the soccer practice and interaction with characters takes place. While the dialogues and visual novel scenes use typical 2D anime character art over static backgrounds, the soccer practice sessions use 3D terrain and SD character style. Each of the 11 soccer team member heroines have both school uniforms and soccer uniforms which they switch during practice time.</p>\n<p>Assembling the team of girls with different personalities is one challenge, making them work as a team furthers the difficulty, but overcoming the obstacles and making them work together is what makes the team strong, and their coordination and tactic fluid and skilled enough to achieve the victory. The soccer part of the game is somewhat turn-based and lets you choose action after each pass of the ball. Each of the girls have the parameters which determine the chance of success of performing a certain move. Some girl is better at passing or dribbling or shooting than the other, so it is imperative to rely on that in order to score the goal and win the match. Performing an action depletes part of the stamina, and as the stamina goes down, so does the chance of success of performing an action. All girls will level up after a match. No matter the victory or defeat, their skill parameters will increase.</p>\n<p>Soccer team heroines, and their field positions, include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>FW - Miku Asuka (\u98db\u9ce5 \u672a\u6765)</li>\n<li>FW - Lola Itabashi (\u677f\u6a4b \u30ed\u30fc\u30e9)</li>\n<li>MF - Mai Kiyamachi (\u6728\u5c4b\u753a \u821e)</li>\n<li>MF - Shinobu Igano (\u4f0a\u8cc0\u91ce \u5fcd)</li>\n<li>MF - Moe Urahara (\u6d66\u539f \u840c)</li>\n<li>MF - Mue Sawamura (\u6ca2\u6751 \u5922\u7d75)</li>\n<li>DF - Rei Arino (\u6709\u91ce \u73b2)</li>\n<li>DF - Sumire Paru (\u7fbd\u6d41 \u7d14\u9023)</li>\n<li>DF - Guguru Andou (\u5b89\u85e4 \u3050\u3050\u308b)</li>\n<li>DF - Rua Shiga (\u6ecb\u8cc0 \u7460\u4e9c)</li>\n<li>GK - Mahiro Motoyama (\u672c\u5c71 \u307e\u3072\u308d)</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p>Ozawa Rina, a touch detective, and her assistant Nameko, are back for the third time on yet another case. This time in 3D mode on 3DS instead of NDS as the first two games. The gameplay is mainly the same, the player controls Rina character in 3rd-person perspective using point-and-touch interface. Rina can pick up items and add them to her inventory, talk to other characters and check various objects in the ares she's in by touching them. Collected items can be more closely examined and interacted with, while some can be combined with other items.</p>\n<p>Similar to hint coins in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Professor+Layton\">Professor Layton</a> games, this game has name-coins (Japanese \"name\", not English word \"name\") which are hidden at various spots not visible to the naked eye and will require player to randomly touch and check hidden places for such coins. Name-coins too, just as in <em>Professor Layton</em> games are used for hints. Rina also carries her info book with her where she adds info about characters she meets.Aside for hints, name-coins can also be used in lottery which lets you collect Nameko figurines and completing a full set yields a reward.</p>",

On a peaceful day in Primp Town, Arle and her good friend Carbuncle were enjoying the day, when all of a sudden, a book with a moon and sun dropped from the sky and transported the dynamic duo into a strange new world! Why? As it turns out, she's the so-called \"Great Hero\" of this particular world. But there's no time for dilly-dallying... Arle, aided by an adventurer named Ally, and a host of other friends that also got sucked in, may as well high-tail it to the tower if she's to fulfill her destiny in this world... and to make it back to hers.</p>\n<p><em>Puyo Puyo Chronicle</em> is a puzzle/RPG set in the <em>Puyo Puyo</em> universe where Arle Nadja and a host of other allies must fight through a world full of monsters to save it from total destruction. Battles are fought in a variation of standard <em>Puyo Puyo</em> fashion: attack enemies by making chains, while at the same time trying to alternately conserve health and avoid getting swamped in Nuisance Puyo! Winning battles gains experience and levels up the party, which makes characters stronger. In addition, a series of side quests can be completed, with wonderful rewards awaiting at the end.</p>\n<p>Of course, it wouldn't be a <em>Puyo Puyo</em> game without the Battle Mode, where up to 4 players face each other in a fight to the last.</p>",

The cat-themed game pieces connect to each other and form visible chains as the player places pieces of the same colour next to each other. Unlike <em>Puyo Puyo</em>, chains don't trigger automatically when a certain number of pieces connect together; instead, the player can transform falling game pieces into combo-starters of the same colours at any time, allowing the player to build chains at their own pace or frantically pop pieces when they're in trouble.</p>",

Like the original, Illvelo Dillinjah features surreal superflat artwork depicting the inside of a computer operating system and pounding techno music. The player has several ships to choose between. The TRAX is the ship from the original game, keeping its gameplay; the Kojiro plays like <em>Radirgy</em>, replacing the original game's unique support ships with a sword, letting the player choose between traditional shmup shooting and close-range attacks; and Deterrent the Naginata provides a variant on the Kojiro's gameplay.</p>\n<p>Rather than a complete game, this plays like a compilation of the short hidden stages from the original game. These act as short challenge stages which must be completed quickly and precisely.</p>",

A weather machine has been sabotaged and you need to collect control crystals to end the storm.\nThe game is split up into chapters, as you try to gather crystals, whilst also pursuing information leading to the culprit.\nMuch of the machinery is inoperative, requiring you to gather parts to get them working again. This results in recurring scavenger hunting gameplay, as you scour the various available rooms for the missing items.\nMore than 50 minigames appear throughout the game, including cracking lock combinations, placing cogs, and rearranging a pipe network.</p>",

The gameplay features both vertical and horizontal scrolling stages, where markers move in from one end of the screen towards the other. When the marker overlaps your target marker it's time to either press a button or move the stick in the way designated by the marker. The game also includes a \"Simple Mode\" that reduces the variation of inputs down to just button taps for those that find the game too challenging.</p>\n<p>There are 65 songs to pick from and could be extended by DLC from the Nintendo eShop. </p>\n<p>The game features three main game modes: </p>\n<p>Music Mode - Play through play your unlocked songs in the true and tested Theatrhythm style.\nChallenge Mode - Clear challenges set to unlock more songs for the game.\nSugoroku Mode - A Boardgame style mode where you try to race to the end of the board by throwing a dice, facing challenges along the way. This mode grants you gems that can be spent to unlock more characters.</p>",

Rather than an action sports game, it is a tactical strategy game with turn-based gameplay to manage the squad with the individual players to beat opponents in matches.</p>\n<p>The game can be played in a Game or Adventure mode. Players must converse in the adventure mode and communicate with other characters. The tale can vary from the original series based on the role the player wants to manage, as new plot lines activate. In the game mode, the players can compete against opposing teams in volleyball matches.</p>\n<p>Also included is a Final Haikyu Quest mode, which takes the players and places them in a traditional RPG itself (similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dragon+Quest\">Dragon Quest</a>). Instead of their team uniform, characters assume looks identical to RPG classes.</p>",

The game is a turn-based tactical role-playing game, but with the character having rankings, like in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Yo-kai+Watch+2\">Yo-kai Watch 2</a>. The main protagonist is chosen by the player, which are Jibanyan, Komasan, and USApyon. The game starts with Jibanyan and Komasan exploring a library. While they are reading a mysterious book, they were suddenly pulled inside of the story. They are soon followed by USApyon, and depending on which the player picked in the beginning the story is different.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Daigasso! Band Brothers P</em> is a music game in Japanese.</p>\n<p>The game contains a variety of different instruments, which are combined selectively in order to compose a song. Among multiple kinds of instruments, one player chooses one instrument to play it by press correct button at certain time point, just like other music games. That is the origin of the game series' title: \"Daigasso\" means \"Grand ensemble\" in Japanese. The game primarily focuses on multiplayer.</p>\n<p>Besides the songs included initially within the game, players can compose their own songs and share them to other players' Nintendo 3DS console through local wireless network.</p>\n<p>Before the game server's closure on May 1, 2020, players were able to download and purchase songs from the game server using the in-game fictitious currency \"tomato\", or play instrument with other players online. Before March 21, 2017, players was also able to upload songs composed by themselves to the game server.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Battle of Elemental REBOOST</em> is an enhanced rerelease of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/87783/clash-of-elementalists/\">DSi original</a> featuring updated artwork and new elements. Like the original game, it's effectively a fantasy take on the classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8692/cyber-troopers-virtual-on/\">Virtual On</a>; players battle each other in one-on-one matches in a 3D arena with the camera behind their character, using a combination of ranged and melee attacks to control space and take down the enemy. The new version takes advantage of the 3DS's hardware to improve the quality of character models. It also adds a new survival mode, where players take on CPU-controlled enemies one after another for as long as they can, and an online versus mode.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Bikkuriman Kanjuku Ha\u014d: Sanmi D\u014dran Sens\u014dki</em> is a card battle game. It is basically a digital translation of the collectible card game <em>Bikkuriman Kanjuku Ha\u014d</em>.</p>\n<p>In the game, every card features a Kanji (i.e. Chinese character in Japanese). The battle rules are based on numbers of strokes of Kanji. The player who plays cards with a greater number of strokes will become defensive, which is advantageous in this game, in the next round. Players can play one or more cards within a round, while playing multiple cards is allowed only when Kanji on the cards can be combined into a word. The winner is the player who plays all of his cards first.</p>",

Searching for the mysterious \"fabled fruit\", he charges around the whole island and lets no animal or obstacle get in his way.</p>\n<p>The game is a 2D platformer with a focus on eating. Gon constantly needs to find food to keep his hunger meter from draining, which would lead to a quick game over. He is otherwise practically invincible, and enemies or obstacles can only stun him for a short time. Boss fights are also centered around food, with the player being tasked to eat more food than the other characters within a time limit.</p>\n<p>There is some minor use of 3DS hardware features like the 3D screen and gyro controls, allowing Gon to look into the 3D background of a stage by pressing R, where he can look for objects to interact with, or hidden animals in various situations which act as collectibles.</p>",

When Ruby refuses a command from her owner, Rin Tohsaka, to release Illya from her contract, Rin begrudgingly recruits Illya as her servant. Illya must put her new powers to the test when Rin sends her on a mission to collect the Class Cards, cards imbued with magical powers which are scattered around Fuyuki City - but Illya isn't the only one seeking the cards.</p>\n<p>Throughout the game, the player collects different spell cards to form a deck to use in battles. These battles feature combat similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8692/cyber-troopers-virtual-on/\">Virtual-On</a>, taking place against single opponents in 3D arenas. The player can switch between cards during battles, finding the right combination of spells to win. Most battles have a time limit of 60 seconds or more. In addition, the game features a multiplayer mode where up to four players can play against each other using their customized decks.</p>",
