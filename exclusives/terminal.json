        "description": "<p><em>Bamboozle!</em> was a simple quiz game available through UK television broadcaster Channel 4's teletext service from 1993 to 2009. Hosted by Bamber Boozler and his family, the quiz consisted of between 12 to 25 multiple choice questions. Each question had four choices which the player selected using one of the four coloured buttons on their Fastext television remote, either red, green, yellow, or blue. To complete the quiz you have to answer all of the questions correctly. Originally if a player answered a question incorrectly they'd have to start the quiz again from the very beginning, however this was later changed so that the player would only have to re-answer a maximum of three questions.</p>",

The game changed the gameplay of its predecessor by allowing direct control of the spaceship and scrapping the economic simulation altogether.

Starships followed the laws of physics keeping their momentum. To brake, the ship had to be rotated in reverse and thrust given to counteract the forces.

        "description": "<p>The fourth official version of <em>Empire</em> integrates many of the simplifications and setting elements of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/99933/empire-michelin-/\">Empire -michelin-</a> although the story prompts were made optional. New is a strategic view which allows a more zoomed out view of the galaxy. Each player controls a starship which can destroy enemy starships, bomb enemy armies, beam up friendly armies and beam them down on enemy or neutral planets to capture them. The characteristics of the starships differ between races. Ships featured classic space ship weaponry such as phasers and torpedoes. </p>\n<p>This version of the game has 4 teams (Federation, Romulans, Vulcans (later renamed Orions) and Klingons (later renamed Kazari)) and allows 32 players. Whichever team manages to conquer all 25 planets establishes an empire and wins the game. Occasionally in games a doomsday machine can appear. The only way to destroy it is by carefully timing a self-destruct.</p>",

The game features four planetary systems and players fly around in spaceships. The game is presented in wireframe 3D with an update rate of roughly once every second. Each player can fire phasers and (manually guided) photon torpedoes and fight in teams (one for each planetary system). Players move their ship around by entering polar coordinates. To add an educational twist to the game (so that it would not be taken down from the PLATO network) positions are only available in Cartesian coordinates.</p>\n<p>A later update added space stations and resource management and de-emphasized combat. Different teams can cooperate to extract valuable resources from far off planets. The proletariat on planets can also revolt.</p>\n<p>The talkomatic chat system allows players to communicate with each other during the game.</p>",

Development of the game was inspired by hearing stories of the development of contemporary <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=dnd\">dnd</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/101845/orthanc/\">Orthanc</a>. As common in RPGs the player starts with creating a character. Characters have stats (Cunning, Piety, Valor, Wizardry, Vitality, Age) that determine the character's strengths and weaknesses. Characters move around the game world in a first person view with wire-frame graphics and movement in steps. Monsters can be fought with weapons and spells.</p>\n<p>Food and water must be managed to stay alive and characters can also die of old age. The town area allows players to access shops and guilds (each of which had a special power for its members). The wilderness outside town features only weak monsters, but has entrances to four dungeons (Cave, Mountain, Forest, Desert) of 60 levels each. A hidden Ocean dungeon was added in a later update. Each level is on a 6x6 grid. Players can tie strings to objects to find their way back to previous locations, unless monsters chew it through. Magic objects can be found, but they are protected by boss monsters.</p>\n<p>Players could create groups of up to 10 players to travel together under the lead of a designated guide.</p>",

The player beholds the galaxy from a space ship in a first person perspective.</p>\n<p>It is played in real time, with real physics. Ships are entire ringworlds, with Bussard ramjets replacing the central sun. The galaxy is populated by stars using a pseudo-random number generator, which operates on a real galactic density function from the astrophysical literature. So stars doesn't move and can be revisited.</p>\n<p>\"stargen\", the lesson space (program) that creates the stars, uses the same galactic density function to create a population of stars representing the types most likely to be found at that position. It uses a fourth-order Runge-Kutte integration in energy shells. The planet generator uses the elements found in the generated star to come up with a likely planetary system. Planets farther away from the sun will have atmospheric gasses which does not add up to 100% because some of the gasses will have frozen out on the planetary surface.</p>\n<p>The game was never fully completed because a) you needed a battle computer to actually have a battle, and b) five running instances of the battle computer were too much for CDC 7600 mainframe it was played on.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Orthanc</em> is an RPG on the PLATO network. It draws heavily from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pedit5\">Pedit5</a> but has larger dungeons, more monsters, spells, etc. The player takes on the role of a knight with the goal of retiring as a proven warrior. The knight has various statistics (strength, intelligence, constitution and dexterity) which have an effect on the actions taken in the game. The game is shown in a top down perspective with statistics, experience, spells and inventory shown at the bottom half. To get experience points the player needs to exit the dungeon and convert the accumulated treasure. Levelling up gives access to more spell units (required to cast spells) and hit points.</p>\n<p>The game features an automap (added in a later update, 25 years on) and the player can encounter other players in the dungeon and can chat or fight with each other.</p>",

The game simulates a car race for multiple players. Each player starts their car by selecting a grid point adjacent to the point on the grid the car is currently located. After this during each turn the car can be moved in the same direction and the same number of squares, or any of the squares adjacent to that changing the velocity vector for subsequent turns. Cars musn't crash into the boundaries, which requires the players to make sure to brake in time for sharp turns. The biggest difference with <em>Racetrack</em> is the complexity of the tracks.</p>",

Consequently little details about the game survive to this day.</p>\n<p>The game bore striking similarities to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=dnd\">dnd</a> and featured advanced character sets serving as graphics for the monsters in the game, including a flying dragon picture. Unlike later RPGs on the PLATO network it was a single player game.</p>\n<p>Based on surviving resources, it is believed <em>Dungeon</em> was a remake of the earlier game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pedit5\">The Dungeon (aka Pedit5)</a>. A single player would enter a dungeon and fight monsters, cast spells, and collect treasure. The game stated it would implement all spells from the pen and paper Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Greyhawk supplement, but it is unknown whether all these spells were implemented before the game was removed from the server. The game featured teleporters and chest traps which were new compared to <em>Pedit5</em>, but lacked a backstory.</p>",

The game supports 60 simultaneous users and allows for in-game messaging with a system that features global, group and personal messages. Players can form groups to start exploring the game world. Some spells allow the leader of a group to teleport the entire group. Teleportation could lead to the player (or a whole group) being stoned (inside rock) as in <em>Oubliette</em>. Only an operator could undo the effects. </p>\n<p>The game borrows the boss monsters concept from <em>DND</em> such as \"Reaper of Souls\"</p>",

Inspiration for the name comes from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/101431/how-the-west-was-one-three-x-four/\">How the West was One + Three x Four</a> where Dry Gulch is one of the train stops. Instead of exploring a fantasy dungeon as was the standard at the time in <em>Drygulch</em> the player explores a gold mine. The player can visit the town itself where there are various locations such as the town hall, bank, general store, assay office (where gathered ore can be turned into money), Kitty's Saloon, the sheriff's office and jail, a stable, a hotel, and the cemetery Boot Hill. Each locale has its own contextual menus allowing for different interactions. Not all of which might necessarily help the player, such as shooting the assay office's proprietor. Actions can lead the player to prison or the cemetery. Elections allow players to run for mayor, sheriff and inspector, bringing even more options to play. The Sheriff can assign rewards to the capture of other players that broke the law and send them to jail. Elected players can be killed even when they are offline.</p>\n<p>The core of the game uses a typical stats system similar to <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>, with stats like strength and dexterity. But it also added stats for injuries, hunger and thirst and carrying capacity. Players can buy a mule at the stables which has similar stats. Instead of fantasy monsters the mine features rats, bats, spiders, bears and coyotes. When coming in contact with a creature a player has the choice to fight, swear (scare it away), ignore (hope it will do the same), evade (skill check based on dexterity) or run. A random roll would determine the outcome of the player's actions.</p>\n<p>The dungeon is displayed in a first person view with vector graphics showing walls. The town locales are 2D graphical depictions.</p>",

The game became available on the PLATO network in 1977 and was updated until 1979. Instead of the Enterprise the player controls a hero. The game retains the game world of a 10x10 universe with each quadrant consisting of 10x10 tiles. Hiding in the tiles the player can find all kinds of threats such as wizards, demons, werewolves, goblins, zombies and a dragon. The player can go to the castle to receive a mission (e.g. kill a number of enemies of type x) and earns experience points for various actions in the game. The player also accumulates gold and collect different weapons and equipment. Magic items were added in spring 1978. Players can also chop down trees.

        "description": "<p>dnd, or The Game of Dungeons, is a terminal-access CRPG originally hosted on the PLATO network, and as of 2004 has been hosted on the Cyber1 network in an emulated form. Like pedit5, developed either before it or concurrently with, it is a pure dungeon crawler, heavily inspired by the Dungeons &amp; Dragons roleplaying game published only a year before it.</p>\n<p>You generate a character with randomly chosen stats including Strength, IQ, Wisdom, Dexterity, and HP, which are initially each set between 3 and 18, but can increase or decrease based on events in the game. Your goal is to explore a 20-level dungeon, find gold (which increases your HP and spell points), gain XP to gain more character levels, find magic equipment, and eventually become strong enough to kill a dragon on the lower floors of the dungeon, take its magical orb, and survive the trip back to the surface as the orb gathers the attention of extremely strong monsters.</p>\n<p>Encounters with monsters may be resolved by fighting, escaping, or casting spells. Your spell stock is limited, but is often the best way to kill monsters without suffering damage in a straight fight. Gold is found everywhere, lying in piles around the dungeon, and the deeper you venture, the bigger the piles, but the more gold you carry, the stronger the monsters that you will attract. Even bigger piles of gold may be found in randomly found treasure chests, but chests are sometimes trapped, and opportunities to detect or disarm traps are limited.</p>\n<p>Beware, for the death of your character is final, and there is no way to recover except by starting from the beginning again.</p>\n<p>The original 1975 version by Ray Wood and Gary Whisenhunt no longer exists, but the Cyber1 network hosts v5.4 and v8.0 versions of the game, both featuring enhancements made by Dirk and Flint Pellett. The v8.0 version is much bigger and much more complex, featuring three dungeons instead of one, and an online instruction manual with more than twice as many pages.</p>",

The game features various terrain types such as sand and water hazards, rough, fairway, putting greens, trees, etc. The game uses a top down view to display the course with various zoom levels, but the player enters their shot information using a text prompt. For each turn the player must pick a club and adjust aim based on wind velocity and direction as well as give a power level for the swing. Direction is entered as an angle, where right = 0 degrees, up=90 degrees, left = 180 degrees and down = 270 degrees, which takes some getting used to. After each shot the graphics update once to show the new location of the ball and you repeat the process. The game allows play with multiple players over the network. Also included is a driving range for practising hitting the ball.</p>\n<p>The game was eventually removed from the PLATO network and recreated from scratch as \"Golf\".</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Multi-User Dungeon: MUD1</em> or simply <em>MUD</em> is an online game where multiple players can simultaneously explore a dungeon using a text-based interface. When logging in to the game the player starts with creating a character, which consists of a name and sex. The aim of the game is to become a wizard or witch. To become a wizard a player must accumulate 102,400 points from the accumulation of treasure (and then dumping it in the swamp) and killing other creatures or players. Once the player becomes a wizard he or she becomes a game operator with additional powers including immortality.</p>\n<p>The world is described through text snippets and the player is encouraged to maintain a map using pen and paper. To move around the game uses a text parser similar to early text adventures. Additionally the player can look around and interact with various objects and characters. Since the game allows many people to be connected at once textual chatting is a large part of the experience.</p>\n<p>Characters have a stamina, strength and dexterity statistic which used for fighting. Dexterity is the chance of striking the enemy, strength determines the amount of damage done and stamina the amount of damage that can be had before dying. Fleeing from a fight loses the player points, and the victor wins points. When dying in a fight the player has to start over completely. Stamina regenerates when using the sleep command or when not playing the game. The statistics are increased by increasing the player level which is based on the current score of the player.</p>\n<p>There are two different deaths in the game. Dying in a fight (stamina drops to 0) results in a permanent death. Other events such as traps or jumping of a cliff results in a temporary death. The player is booted from the game and all items are dropped. They must be recovered manually.</p>",

It was originally coded in BASIC on a PDP 11, and played over a teletype, with the display printed onto paper. The original version can't be played now as it was never released commercially, but in 2014 Garriott unearthed the code, and ran a competition where the goal was to recreate the game so that it would be playable in a browser. Several of the versions created are still online, and the game is also playable within Garriott's Shroud of the Avatar.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is heavily based on the tabletop RPG <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dungeons+%26+Dragons\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>. You randomly generate a character with scores in Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, purchase equipment, and choose one of three classes (Fighter, Cleric or Wizard). Then you enter a top-down dungeon represented by ASCII characters, where you fight monsters and collect treasure. There's no story, and no goal beyond amassing treasure, which you can use to buy more hit points as well as spells.</p>",

The goal is to clear the entire board of tiles. The height of tiles was shown by increasing the border thickness, so tiles that were higher up the stack would have a thicker border.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Camelot</em> is a multiplayer RPG game that runs on the PLATO network. Players control a knight of the round table in Arthurian times. King Arthur is sick and only the Holy Grail can save him. This is the players' primary quest. The player can choose from different character types to play (human, dwarf, elf, hobbit, ogre, pixie), each has their own different stats which are mostly taken directly from DND (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Charisma, Armor Class), which allow for different play styles.</p>\n<p>The game uses a first person perspective with a wire-frame view of the world, showing players where they can go. The player starts in the city but enters the dungeons beneath where most of the action takes place. Different actions such as killing monsters or stealing items from them awards score which is accumulated until the character dies or retires. The title screen of the game shows the leaderboard of the characters who reached the highest score.</p>\n<p>Combat uses attack and defense stats which are modified by the player's level and other stats. The player can make combat easier by trying to charm a monster they encounter. If the charm is successful the monster will join them as a companion until the effects wear off. During their quest players can also find various items and gold to help them on their way. Items can be bought and sold in a store in the city.</p>\n<p>The game features four different difficulty modes.</p>\n<p>A later addition of the game was auto-mapping, which allows a player to log in with a different account to a different program which shows a top-down map of the dungeon and the current location of one or more players. Any traps and secrets are not shown on the map.</p>",
