A grid of aliens slowly descends down the screen while moving back and forth. The player controls a tank on the bottom of the screen and must shoot all the alien invaders. There are three bunkers behind which the player can take cover until they are destroyed. Sometimes a UFO flies over which can be shot for bonus points. There are four game difficulties offering minor game changes such as the invaders not firing back in the easiest difficulty.</p>",
