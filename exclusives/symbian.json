The game is in full 3D and the player gets to control three different sport cars from a third-person perspective. The cars differ in speed, acceleration and handling. The game's tracks are based on real life locations including Paris, Moscow, San Francisco, Jakarta and Rio de Janeiro. The game can be played by up to four players in multiplayer over Bluetooth or against three AI opponents. It's also possible to compete in a time trial where the player just competes against the clock. </p>\n<p>The game also features <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Gamelion\">Gamelion's</a> global racing community. This includes a track editor, tools for user generated content as well as web and mobile cross multiplayer. </p>\n<p>The game was designed to showcase the capabilities of the Nokia E90 Communicator and was released as freeware by Nokia. Due to this it requires a S60 3rd Edition phone with a dedicated 3D graphics accelerator. Both vertical and horizontal modes are available and the game takes advantage of the phone's 800x360 pixels screen. The phone's tilt motion control is used for steering.</p>",

Sometimes, objects other than Gems will also appear, such as heavy objects which can be used to push down entire rows.

After determining the starting location, the player gets to design his own tracks by drawing an orange line over the map. At each intersection arrows appear with possible directions and selecting one of them then creates a route. The visual design does not consist of a real map, but drawn graphics as a layer using the real data. Next to the custom locations it is also possible to select major European cities such as Lisbon, London, Madrid, Monaco and more to race over a pre-designed track. Tracks can be saved for later use.</p>\n<p>Different types of sports cars are available to race with statistics based on cornering, power and stability. Racing can optionally be done against a ghost car. While racing an orange arrow near the car shows the direction of the next turn. Races can be done as multiple laps and the best lap time is saved.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Lara Croft: Tomb Raider - Legend</em> is a mobile game version of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Lara+Croft:+Tomb+Raider+-+Legend\">console/PC game</a> of the same name. The game takes place in three of the locations of the original game: Tokyo, Ghana and Cornwall. Each location has its own visual style and contains three levels. Lara's quest is to find Excalibur, King Arthur's famous sword which has been shattered into three pieces. The first shard is believed to be in the possession of a Japanese relic collector named Takamoto so Lara goes to Tokyo in an attempt to get the shard. The problem however is that Takamoto is a boss of the Yakuza who likely won't give it away freely.</p>\n<p>The game is a side-scrolling platformer with polygonal 3D graphics. Most of the gameplay involves running left and right, jumping between platforms and shooting the various enemies that stand in Lara's way. Obstacles such as electric cables and laser defense systems have to be avoided either by jumping over or rolling under. Sometimes Lara has to swing around poles or use her grappling hook to reach far off platforms. The grappling hook can also be used to swing into and knock out enemies. The gunfights are quite simple and only Lara's regular handgun can be used. Bullets can be dodged by crouching but the enemies can do the same.</p>\n<p>Next to the Symbian version of the game, there is also a J2ME version called <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/76753/lara-croft-tomb-raider-legend-tokyo/\">Lara Croft: Tomb Raider - Legend: Tokyo</a> that only includes the first location of the game.</p>",

In the game, the player takes on the role of symbologist Robert Langdon as he attempts to solve the mystery behind the murder of the curator of the Louvre museum.</p>\n<p>Gameplay takes place in a 3D environment and requires the player to navigate the levels using character-relative controls, or \"tank controls,\" which was a common control scheme for systems that do not support analog sticks. The game's primary objective is to explore the environments, examine various objects, and speak with characters in order to advance the plot. While there are no action sequences, the game does include various puzzles that employ different mechanics, such as entering numbers into keypads or turning lock cylinders to pick door locks.</p>",
