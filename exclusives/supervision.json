        "description": "<p><em>Sssnake</em> is a basic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/3173/snake-variants/\">Snake game</a>. The player controls a snake in a small room filled with food and obstacles. The goal is to eat all the food while avoiding the obstacles, but whenever the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer, making it more difficult to maneuver. The snake moves forward at a constant speed and can be turned in the four cardinal directions. Holding a button will make the snake move faster, making it harder to control, but increasing the potential for a time bonus.</p>\n<p>In this particular version, there are a number of apples on each stage. When an apple is eaten, it disappears, and an apple core appears elsewhere on the stage, and when the apple core is eaten, a deadly skull appears somewhere else. The player must eat all of the apples and apple cores in one run; they will all be reset if the snake touches an obstacle. The player will also earn bonus points if all the normal apples are eaten before any apple core is eaten.</p>",

The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in the playfield, organizing them into complete rows, which then disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.</p>\n<p>The most notable difference from regular <em>Tetris</em> is that the game features a 12-by-16-block playfield, compared with the 10-by-20 field found in licensed <em>Tetris</em> titles. There is only one game mode (endless), though the starting level (speed) and amount of garbage can be chosen before starting the game.</p>",

The player is presented with a board filled with mines, and must find all of the open squares without clicking on any of the mines. Open squares contain a number, which indicates how many of the adjacent squares contains a mine. There are easy (55 mines), medium (66 mines), and hard (77 mines) modes.</li>\n<li><em>Fortune Four</em>, a version of the board game <em>Qubic</em>, also known as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=3-D+Tic-Tac-Toe\">3-D Tic-Tac-Toe</a>. The player takes turn with the computer placing stones on a 4x4x4 grid, the goal being to create a chain of four stones in any direction.</li>\n<li><em>Caterpillar</em>, a clone of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/3173/snake-variants/\">Snake</a>. The player controls a snake that must avoid obstacles and eat food placed around the level. When the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer, but if it runs into an obstacle or its own body, it dies.</li>\n<li><em>Hopper</em>, a version of the board game <em>Peg Solitaire</em>. The player is given a grid with marbles arranged on it, and can remove marbles by \"jumping\" over them with an adjacent marble. The goal is to only have a single marble remaining. There are seven different layouts to choose from.</li>\n</ul>",

The titular Super Kong slowly climbs a vine on the left edge of the screen, while the player controls a young child on a vine at the right edge. The object is to throw balls at Kong to knock him down the vine, ultimately knocking him out at the bottom. However, many obstructions fall from the top of the screen, and Kong himself can throw a large projectile that can knock the child out, losing a life. There are a handful of power-ups to assist the player, and it is also possible to jump off the vine to avoid Kong's attacks. The game includes three stages of increasing difficulty.</p>",

The player must explore a randomly-generated labyrinth in search of treasures, moving from screen to screen or by using teleporters. There are many enemies in the cave, which must be either fought or avoided, as well as treasure chests that contain useful items such as fire to destroy enemies, a small plane to move elsewhere in the room, and hearts to refill the player's health. There are four different caves to choose from, each with multiple difficulty levels; increasing the difficulty will increase the complexity of the generated cave, as well as the number of treasures that must be collected before the exit will appear.</p>",

If the blocks reach the top of the screen, the game is over.</p>\n<p>The game includes two modes. Normal mode tasks the player with clearing a certain number of blocks before the playfield fills up. Flash mode requires the player to clear a specific, flashing block, which may be buried under multiple other blocks. Both modes offer three levels of difficulty, as well as multiple different block graphic sets to use.</p>",

The player controls a tank which moves continually forward, and can freely move about the screen firing in any direction; the tank's cannon can be rotated independently of its movement. Enemy tanks appear from all sides, shooting at the player, and must be destroyed or avoided. At the end of each stage, a large boss appears that must be defeated to continue. Power-ups will occasionally appear that will allow the tank to fire in multiple directions simultaneously, but these are lost if the tank takes a hit.</p>",

Similar to the well-known <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Shanghai\">Shanghai</a>, the object is to remove tiles from the board in matching pairs until the entire board is clear. Pairs can only be removed if they can be connected by a line with no more than two turns. The game is timed, and if the time runs out, the puzzle must be restarted. It is also possible to have the computer find a match for you, but this can only be done a limited number of times. The game includes more than a dozen different backgrounds, each representing a different location around the world, and several dozen different puzzle layouts to solve.</p>",

Destroyed ground enemies will drop hearts that give points, and it is also possible to shoot clouds to release items which will also give additional points.

Each stage is filled with blocks and enemies, both of which can be blown up using bombs. Blocks may contain power-ups -- such as power boosts, additional bombs, speed shoes, or remote bombs -- or one of the gold bars that are needed to complete each stage. The goal of each stage is to collect enough gold bars, which will end the stage immediately. Enemies can be defeated with a single bomb blast, but can also defeat the hero just as easily. The game includes five different worlds, each with their own enemy types and setting.</p>",

Impeding the player are a pair of enemy buggies which will chase the player, but it is possible to use part of the car's fuel reserves to kick up dust clouds that will stun the enemies. There are several bonus flags on each stage, and also many bonus food items that will appear randomly and award extra points. The game offers three difficulty settings.</p>",

The player controls a fleet of ships and aircraft, including submarines, destroyers, and fighter jets, against a similarly-equipped enemy fleet on a tile-based map. Each unit type has different abilities and attacks; jets for example are quick and capable of long-range attack, but have little armor and are weak to gunfire, while submarines are invisible except to submarines, and are effective against surface ships. The goal of each map is to destroy the enemy fleet while keeping the player's fleet intact. It is only possible to play against the computer, and the game is saved with passwords.</p>",

The player controls a plumber who must connect two ends of a pipe before the water within overflows. The player can place pipe tiles on the screen toward this end, though each piece of pipe costs money which must also be collected on each stage. There are several other differences from the game's inspiration: there are no cross pieces, the only penalty for replacing a piece is the cost of the pipe, two different pipe pieces are held at any time, and there are also rocks which can be pushed around that playfield that will block the path and destroy pipes.</p>",

The player controls a man who can push and pull these blocks, as well as jump around the stage, who must also be careful not to let himself be crushed by the blocks. There are two different modes: beginner mode features relatively easy puzzles with no time limit, while skilled mode includes harder puzzles that must be completed within a time limit.

        "description": "<p><em>Sonny Xpress</em> is a mail-delivery action game starring the titular Sonny, a monkey who rides a moped. The player controls Sonny as he rides around town delivering packages. To do so, he must first go to the post office and pick up a package, then check the map for his destination, and then finally ride there and make the delivery before starting over again. He must also be mindful of his surroundings, as there are dangerous cars and many other obstacles, and one hit will wreck his ride.</p>\n<p>Delivering packages earns money, which must be deposited in the bank in order to save it. Money can also be used to refuel the moped, and also to pay traffic fines at the police office. Ignoring traffic signs such as red lights and stop signs will land Sonny with a stiff fine that must be repaid.</p>",

However, it's not that simple; when shot, the balloons will split into two smaller balloons, and only the smallest size will be destroyed when hit. There are several power-ups that will randomly appear to aid the player, including long-lasting shots, quick-fire shots, and scrolls that instantly reduce all balloons on the screen to the smallest size. Pop enough balloons to move onto the next stage.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Assembloids</em> is a fast paced reaction puzzler based on the 2010 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Quartet\">Quartet</a>. The playfield consists of 5 windows, arranged in a plus shape. Parts of creatures in different colours appear in the central one, and then have to be moved to one of the four other windows using the joystick. If a window already has the space of that part occupied the player will lose a life. A life is also lost if the player takes too long to move the part. When a full creature is assembled the player is awarded points. The more uniformly coloured the creature is the higher the point gain. If the player manages to clear all the windows and extra life is awarded.</p>\n<p>The game gets faster as it goes on, losing a life will slow it down a bit, but upon doing well again it goes back to getting faster pretty quick. There are a number of difficulty settings available, which have an impact on how fast the game gets and how quickly the speed picks up.</p>\n<p>The Supervision version was a limited release of only 60 packages.</p>\n<p>The shrink-wrapped Supervision version includes:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cartridge</li>\n<li>numbered certificate with autographs of the developers</li>\n<li>cardboard box</li>\n<li>printed manual (in English)</li>\n<li>poster</li>\n<li>multiple stickers</li>\n</ul>",
