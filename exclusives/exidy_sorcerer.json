It is a fixed-screen shoot 'em up where the player controls a space ship moving left and right along the bottom of the screen while firing a laser at the aliens above. The Galaxians start in a formation and move horizontally across the screen. At times a single alien leaves the formation and swoops down towards the player who has to dodge it as well as any projectiles launched. The aim is simply to kill all aliens and get to the next level while avoiding getting hit. The game is over when all three lives have been lost.</p>",

In the alleys are also a number of arrows that start at the opposite end of the screen and attempt to crash into the player's car. The player's task is to prevent them from doing this by shooting them down first. At some times a pit will open up and a rocket will appear. It has to be avoided just like the arrows but is worth more points when shot. The player has five cars and an extra one is given for every level completed. There are four difficulty levels and the game can be played by one or two players in hot seat.</p>",

Any contact with them will lead to a lost life but by eating a power pill the player can for a short moment go after and kill the ghosts. Additionally the chomp can eat berries for bonus points. A level is completed when all dots have been eaten and the game goes on until all of the player's three lives are lost.</p>",

The space ship has a limited amount of fuel and it might run out if the player moves too recklessly. It is also possible to overheat the lazer cannon if it's used too frequently.</p>\n<p>Each level of the game contains five waves of enemies, each with its own kind that has its own movement pattern. There are spinners, lazer ships, rockets, flame throwers and meteor showers. Like in Astro Blaster, each level ends with the player having to dock with a mothership which restores fuel and shield strength and cools the lazer cannon. Before a game the player can choose the number of shields (lives) from one to nine.</p>",

This is made harder by pits which when stepped over transports the player to a random location in the maze. Pits are shown before starting but becomes invisible during the game. The size of the maze and the difficulty is set by the player who also gets to choose between two modes: L or M. In the L mode the entire maze is visible (except the pits) while in the M mode it's necessary to memorize the maze since walls only become visible when they are bumped into. The game is played with keyboard by typing in directions (U, D, L, R).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Military Encounter</em> is a computer adaptation of the board game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Stratego\">Stratego</a>. It's a single player game played against an AI opponent. Each combatant has forty pieces that they place on their side of the board ahead of the game. One of the pieces is a flag which the opponent has to try and capture. Units have ranks which decide what enemies they can defeat in combat. Higher rank units defeat lower rank units which are then removed from the board. The general is the highest rank and can defeat any other unit. The exception is the spy (the lowest rank) which can only defeat the general but only if it attacks first. There are also bombs which kill any unit that attacks them except for miner units which can dismantle the bombs. The ranks of the enemies are only revealed once they attack or are being attacked. For each turn, the player can move one unit one square. The player wins the game by capturing the enemy flag or when the enemy forfeits a hopeless situation. In addition to the regular game there is a Super Encounter mode where the enemy ranks are never revealed.</p>",

There are pulses that are fired straight forward and there are bombs that are dropped on ground targets. There are several different enemies that have to be avoided or shot down. There are also energy pods on the ground that have to be destroyed to replenish the ship's energy level. The aim of the game is to fly as far as possible. After 100 km, bonus points are given and the game restarts.</p>",

If the opponent gets an ace an insurance is offered which allows the player to bet on if it has blackjack.
