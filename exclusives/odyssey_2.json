Munchkin!</a>, our hero confronts the dreaded tree-eating Dratapillars of Venus!</p>\n<p>The player controls K.C. in a top-down maze. K.C. must defeat Dratapillar, a multicolored centipede, by eating each of its round segments from the rear, avoiding to touch its head. K.C. must also avoid Dratapillar's assistants, the Drats. When K.C. eats one of Dratapillar's segments, the Drats turn white and stop chasing K.C., who can catch them, making them spin. After a while, the Drats will stop spinning and will return to the chase. The maze is also populated by ever-growing trees that can be eaten either by K.C. or the Dratappilar.</p>\n<p>K.C. earns 1 point for each tree eaten, 3 points for each Dratappilar's segment eaten and 10 points for each Drat stopped. When he munches out all Dratapillar's segments, he earns a 20 points bonus and proceeds to the next stage, with faster Dratapillar and Drats.</p>\n<p>The game offers five pre-built mazes and a programming mode which allows the players to construct their own mazes.</p>",

The player controls a fighter plane on a night mission, and his task is to take off, destroy the target, avoid enemy attack and return to base.</p>\n<p>The plane is controlled both with the joystick and the keyboard. With the joystick, the player controls the plane's direction (up, down, left or right) and weapon (with the action button). With the keyboard, he controls the several plane's instruments.</p>\n<p>The game is seen from the plane's cockpit in a first person perspective. There's a main display, which will show (by player's request via keyboard) the plane's speed (M key), height (H), fuel (F), distance to target (T), distance to base (B), ammunition amount (W), weapon selected and friend/foe status. Above the main display, four lights can be seen, showing which weapon is selected: cannon (C), bomb (B), ground missile (G) and air missile (A). To the right, a direction and level indicator can be seen, and below it an infrared sensor.</p>\n<p>After taking off, the player must raise the landing gear (U) before the plane exceeds Mach 0.5 speed, or else the plane will be destroyed. Once in the air, after locating a target the player must identify (I) if it is a friendly or enemy aircraft. Shooting friendly airplanes or vehicles will terminate the mission.</p>\n<p>After destroying the targets, the player must land the plane. To do so, he needs to be at low speed, with the landing gear down and aligned to the ground. After touching the ground, the plane must hit the end of the runway as slow as possible. Failing to achieve these conditions will make the plane crash.</p>\n<p>The plane will be also destroyed if it gets hit by an enemy, hits the ground, or runs out of fuel.</p>",

        "description": "<p>As the name implies, <em>Clay Pigeon!</em> is a clay pigeon shooting game. At the left corner, a trap launches targets toward the shooter. The player controls the shooter which stands in the right corner of the screen.</p>\n<p>In order to proceed to the next level, the player has to hit at least eight of the ten plates thrown. While he's shooting, some ducks will appear flying over his head. They'll drop \"bombs\" over him, and if he doesn't avoid them, he'll be stunned for some time. If he fails to shoot the minimum plates necessary, an eagle will appear and attack him. He needs to shoot the eagle twice to avoid its attack. If he fails, the game is over.</p>\n<p>The shooter has two shots per row; after those two shots, he has to reload the gun, by putting it down. He can be moved left and right, but if he exceeds the left mark, he'll fall to the ground, being subject to lose plates.</p>\n<p>The player earns five points per each plate, ten points per each duck and 100 points per eagle (50 per shot).</p>",

There are four colored lines of blocks, and each line has an electronic demon. The electronic demons can replace removed blocks when charged. They'll be charged by touching either sides of the screen. After placing a block, they'll lose the charge, and if they try to cross a gap uncharged, they'll fall and reappear after a penalty time. In two players mode, the second player controls the electronic demons as they try to prevent the first player to blast through the barricade. The player has 90 seconds to try achieving it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In <em>Breakdown!</em>, the object is to destroy the most blocks the player can within 60 seconds. Unlike in <em>Blockout!</em>, the ball (called Blockbuster) will not ricochet when hitting blocks, only when hitting the screen edges, destroying all the blocks it crosses on its way. In two players mode the second player again controls the electronic demons, which now move twice faster than in <em>Blockout!</em>. A counter at the top of the screen marks how many blocks are left.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In both variations, the number of Blockbusters (balls) is unlimited.</p>",

After placing their bets (through the keyboard), the dealer shuffles the cards and deals two face-up cards for each player and one face-up card and one face-down card to himself. He then asks the players to hit more cards or not (up to five). After each player has been dealt a full hand, the dealer reveals his face-down card. He'll take a hit if he has a total of 16 or less.</p>\n<p>Blackjack or five cards without a bust pays double. The nearest to 21 hands pays even. No money is paid if there is a tie.</p>\n<p>The computer offers an insurance bet if the dealer's first card is an ace. If the player accepts and the dealer goes blackjack, the player will lose no money. Otherwise, he will win or lose the current bet plus a half.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the computer will also offer a double down. If the player accepts, the bet is doubled and he will get just one more card.</p>",

        "description": "<p>While the packaging promises \"an electronic simulation so real you can even spike a shot\", this is in fact a volleyball game which has a very loose interpretation of the standard rules. In fact, it can be described as a cross between volleyball and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pong\">Pong</a>: Each six-man team is separated by a large line, which the casual observer would interpret as the net. The line is open at the top, and this is the only place where the ball can pass through into the other court. While the ball is in your court, it can be passed as many times as you want, and bounced against the \"net\" and the back of the court. As long as the ball doesn't touch the bottom of the screen, it is safe. The joystick moves the entire team in strict formation, and the ball passes through the players if they are held still, or bounced in the direction they are moving. A status display at the bottom of the screen writes out in clear text whether there is a serve change, a spike, scoring or otherwise.</p>",

The skiers are controlled with the stick. By holding the stick down, the skier runs down in a straight line. By pushing up, the skier stops.

Starting with $500,000, the players must turn it into a million so they can return for their time, or else be doomed to roam the Keynesian mazes forever!</p>\n<p>In this game, the players play against the Keynesian robots in seven kinds of mazes, called Income, Reward, Investment, Expenses, Thief, Taxes and Inflation. In the first three kinds of mazes, the player must try to catch the robots in order to gain money. In the last four kinds of mazes, the players must run from the robots, as they lose money if caught.</p>\n<p>In both kinds of mazes, a money counter will appear at the bottom of the screen, showing different values of money each time a maze is started. The counter will start to decrease and the players will win (if they catch the robots in the three first kinds of mazes) or lose (if they are caught by the robots in the last four kinds of mazes) the amount of money shown.</p>\n<p>The players' characters are two times taller than the robots, thus sometimes the players must duck to pass through certain portions of the mazes (by pressing the action button). While ducking the players move at 2/3 the normal speed. If they try to pass through a low ceiling portion without ducking, they'll move at half the speed. Touching the walls of a maze will make it harder to move, and touching the opponent player while touching the a will make him lose control.</p>",

The player can chose up to three variations of mathematical games.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>In the first variation, the player will have to solve regular math problems. He first chooses the kind of operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication or division), next the skill level (1-3) and then is presented with the problems. He must type in the answers, and the computer will register the time elapsed and the number of current problems solved. If the player fails twice to solve a problem, the game is over.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The second variation displays algebraic problems. The player selects the desired skill level (1-3) and has to enter the missing variable to each problem, and the rules are the same to the first variation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The third variation is a addition or multiplication table game. The player chooses addition or multiplication, then the number he wishes to practice.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Echo!</em> is a basic <em>Simon</em> game (as invented by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=+Ralph+H.+Baer\">Ralph H. Baer</a>). Four colored numbers (red, blue, green, and yellow) will appear on the screen. One of them will light up, and a tone will be played. Then it is the player's turn: he has to match the lit up number. Then, the first number will be light up followed by a second one. The player has to match the sequence and it will keep increasing indefinitely. If the player fails three times to match a sequence, the game is over.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

The players control two acrobats jumping over a teeter, moving it in order to avoid the acrobats from crashing into the ground. Once an acrobat lands at one side of the teeter, the acrobat on the opposite side will be launched in the air, toward the balloons. The farther from the opposite acrobat the jumping one lands, the higher the opposite one will be launched. As the acrobats reach the balloons, they'll pop them, bouncing to pop other balloons before falling. Once a row is completely popped, it will be replaced by another one. Each game consists of a ten jumps series.</p>\n<p>The players score 2 points for each blue balloon, 4 points for each yellow balloon and 6 points for each red one. They'll additionally score 15 points for a complete blue row, 20 points for a yellow row and 25 points for a red row.</p>\n<p>The game has a total of 18 possible variations, including one and two player games:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Single player variations:  </p>\n<ol>\n<li>(Press 0) Moving balloons with no shield.</li>\n<li>(Press 3) A stationary shield will be displayed at the center of the screen.

Two players control tanks and try to shoot each other the most in a time limit of three minutes. Each tank has 20 rounds of ammunition. The last three rounds will change color, warning the player the ammunition is low. This game offers 12 variations, selected by the alphanumeric keys:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>(Pressing A): Plays over open country using cannon.</li>\n<li>(Pressing B): Plays over hilly terrain (simple bars) with cannon.</li>\n<li>(Pressing C): Plays over mountainous terrain (complex barriers) with cannon.</li>\n<li>(Pressing D): Open country with guided missiles.</li>\n<li>(Pressing E): Simple barriers with guided missiles.</li>\n<li>(Pressing F): Complex barriers with guided missiles.</li>\n<li>(Pressing G): Plays over open country with minefields (represented by X's on the screen - if a tank hits one of them, a point is scored to the adversary) and cannon.</li>\n<li>(Pressing H): Simple barriers with minefields and cannon.</li>\n<li>(Pressing I): Complex barriers with minefields and cannon.</li>\n<li>(Pressing J): Open country - minefields - guided missiles.</li>\n<li>(Pressing K): Simple barriers - minefields - guided missiles.</li>\n<li>(Pressing L): Complex barriers - minefields - guided missiles.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Sub Chase!</em> features a Hawk hunter-killer jet against a Shark missile-launching submarine. One player controls the jet, which scrolls left, and the other controls the submarine, which scrolls right. While neutral ships sail on the water surface, the players have to shoot each other the most in a time limit of three minutes. Each hit on the enemy scores one point to the player and each hit on the neutral vessels subtracts one point. There are three game variations, selected by the numeric keys:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>(Pressing 1): Guided missiles with rear launch pattern.</li>\n<li>(Pressing 2): Unguided missiles with rear launch pattern.</li>\n<li>(Pressing 3): Guided missiles with forward launch pattern.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>",

A matrix with 20 letters appears on the screen and the player has to find pairs of symbols hidden by the letters. Two counters will be displayed: time and number of matches. In two players mode (selected by pressing \"2\"), the players share the matrix and the one who makes more matches win.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Logix!</em> (selected by pressing \"4\") lets the player guess a sequence of five different digits. The player types in the first try and the computer will display a two digit number with the number of correct digits to the right and the number of correctly placed digits on the left. The player has then to continue guessing the sequence based on the clues given. The object is to solve the problem in the least number of tries, counted on the left ot the screen.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Buzzword!</em> (selected by pressing \"3\") is similar to the Hangman game. A row of dashes will appear in the screen, representing a word. Also, eight X's will appear at the bottom of the screen. The player tries to guess the word at the screen by typing letters on the keyboard. If a letter is right, it is replaced in the word. If it is wrong, it replaces one X on the screen. The game ends when the player has discovered the word or when he has made eight mistakes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p>Two titles are available in this cart:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Out of This World!</em> is a slightly upgraded version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/32761/pairs-space-rendezvous-logic/\">Space Rendezvous</a>. It is somewhat similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Lunar+Lander\">Lunar Lander</a>. Two players have to try to link up their spaceships to the orbiting mother ship, while avoiding hitting the ground. Each ship has 50 megajoules of power and will be refueled when a perfect link-up is performed. A counter will be displayed for each player, and wins the player who first performs 10 perfect link-ups. If one player goes out of fuel, he's out of game. A soft landing for the first descent will grant 20 megajoules of fuel to the space ship, up to a maximum of 60. Crashing the ship will take 10 megajoules to repair it. There are three possible modes of play:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Lunar gravity (selected by pressing \"3\"): easiest mode. The moon is less than 1/3 the diameter of Earth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Martian gravity (selected by pressing \"2\"): harder. Mars' diameter is about half that of Earth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jupiter's gravity (selected by pressing \"0\"): most challenging. Jupiter's volume is equal to 1,319 of Earth's and its mass is 2 1/2 times that of all other planets combined.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Helicopter Rescue!</em> (selected by pressing \"1\") has the player in control of the Daredevil helicopter rescue ship. The object is to rescue the most people from the Doomsday Hotel's rooftop within two minutes and place them in the Rescue Station. The helicopter is controlled with the directional stick and the rescue basket is controlled with the action button. Pressing and holding the action button will bring the basket down; pressing again and holding will bring it up.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

The longer the action button is held, the higher the backswing and the farther the ball goes. If the club comes full circle, the backswing will be released automatically and the ball will travel a random distance. The backswing of the club will always be clockwise, and the downswing will always be counter-clockwise. The ball's direction will depend on the golfer's relative position. There's no penalty for swinging the club away from the ball.</p>\n<p>The trees in the field will stop the course of the ball, making the golfer angry. If the ball reaches the \"rough\" (the black area outside the field), the golfer cannot walk on it and will need to hit the ball back into the field. Once the ball is on the green, the camera will zoom in. Golfers will alternate turns only when the precedent golfer goes through the entire hole. The winner is the golfer with the lowest score for the nine holes.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dynasty!</em> is an <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Othello\">Othello</a> clone. The playfield is an 8 x 8 matrix of dots and the objective is to occupy as much of it as possible. The game begins with two pieces of each color at the center of the matrix and players take turns placing new pieces in it. The pieces must be placed near to an enemy piece, trapping it between another piece of the same color already placed. Trapped pieces will turn over to the conqueror's color.</p>\n<p>A variation is also present, called \"Directional Dynasty\": players cannot trap pieces in more than one direction with the same move. When a piece is placed in such condition, the player has to choose which direction will be used to capture the enemy's pieces.</p>\n<p>A timer can be set, from unlimited time to 99 minutes of gameplay. The game ends when there are no more possible moves or when the time runs up.</p>",

Five cups are placed across the screen, with two rotors, one at each side, and the Magic Mountain in the middle. The object of the game is to bounce the balls inside the cups to earn points. Each player has an energizer, used to beat the ball. If the action button is pressed, the energizer will be risen and if the ball touches it, it will continue its horizontal direction. If the ball touches an energizer not completely raised, the ball direction will be reversed. If the ball hits a player, it will lose energy.</p>\n<p>The balls change colors each time they hit a rotor or an energizer. Players earn points when balls with their colors bounce inside the cups. If a ball hits the Magic Mountain, the numbers inside the cups will change. There's also Troubleshooter who runs back and forth above the players, trying to catch their balls and throw back to their opponents.</p>\n<p>The first player to reach 100 points (or any multiple of 100) wins. Players can also play against the clock.</p>",

The screen is horizontally divided in the half, and the pyramids have four blocks in the lower layer (or higher for the top player), three in the middle and one at the top (or bottom for the top player). Each block has two possible positions for placing the stones, and after the players place them, a number will appear above (for the up player) or below (for the down player), showing how many of them are correctly placed. Players must then relocate the stones until all of them are placed correctly. When it is done, the higher (or lower) layer of blocks will be liberated. The player who first places all the stones correctly in all the layers wins.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Nimble Numbers Ned</em> was one of the three games specifically designed to use the resources of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=the+Voice\">the Voice</a>. It is a math game where the objective is to make Nimble Numbers Ned jump over 100 numbered stones, avoiding his barrels of fun. To do so, the player has to run through one of the three minigames. At the start of the game, the computer will ask \"which drill?\" to what the player has to answer entering a number on the keyboard (1, 2, or 3). At the start of each drill, the computer will ask \"how good you are?\", to what the player has to answer with a number for the skill level (from 1 to 5). The games selected by the numbers are the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Name the Shapes: in this mini game the player has to identify correctly shapes on the screen. As one shape blinks on the screen, the computer will say \"this is a [name of the shape]\". The player has then to answer \"Y\" or \"N\". Each correct answer in the first try gives the player a chance to jump the barrels. The higher the skill level, the more chances the player get.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Multiplication Runthrough: this is a multiplication game with one and two place operations. The computer asks \"what is XX x X?\" and the player has to answer entering the numbers on the answer from right to left. As in the previous game, each correct answer gives an extra chance of jumping, depending on the skill level.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Function Machine: in this game the player has to solve functions with unknown variables. The computer will ask questions such as \"if the number is X, what is the number plus Y?\", to which the player answers entering the numbers from right to left. Higher skill levels imply in more complex functions. As in the previous two games, correct answers grant the player extra chances to jump depending on the skill level.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There's also a jumping practice game, selected by pressing 0. In this game, the player can train to jump the barrels, but the progress won't be saved.</p>",

Two players (Pussycat and Hounddog) take turns dropping colored (red or green) discs in an eight-column six-row grid. The object is to place 4 discs in a row, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.</p>\n<p>An strategic indicator number on the right side of the screen, besides each name, will show the chances of each player to get four discs in a row. The higher the number, the higher the chances. If the number reads 125 it means the player is just one move away from winning. The strategic indicator can be turned off by pressing CLEAR.</p>\n<p>When playing against the computer, two variations with three skill levels are available:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Playing against Microcat I, II or III (selected by pressing 1, 2 or 3). Microcat uses a micro-sensor (represented by a \u03bc sign) which will stop over each column calculating its chances. The disc will be dropped where the \u03bc stops. The higher the skill level, the bigger the sensor and calculation times.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Playing against Microdog I, II or III (selected by pressing 5, 6 or 7) is similar to playing against Microcat (with the skill levels and \u03bc sensor), but the player can also ask for computer assistance on moves. Whenever player's Pussycat appears, pressing 1, 2 or 3, depending on the skill level, will make the PRESS ENTER text appear along the micro sensor. Once pressed, the computer will take over and will continue until the player presses again 0 and ENTER when Pussycat appears.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",

The numbers must be placed in point D in the same descending order. There are two other points to which the numbers can be moved, B and C.</p>\n<p>If one or more numbers are parked in one of the points, the player can only additionally move to that point numbers which are lower than the last one already parked. The numbers can be moved one by one only and to do so the player has to type the letter of origin and then type the destiny letter. Moves can be undone by pressing the \"clear\" key.</p>\n<p>The computer keeps track of the time elapsed and the number of moves made by the player, also showing the minimum amount of moves to solve the puzzle. There are 9 other possible variations, with the difference of having the way to point D blocked and different amounts of numbers to move. Those variations can be selected by pressing \"reset\" and the desired number, as follows:1. one figure - minimum number of moves: 1\n2. two figures - minimum number of moves: 3\n3. three figures - minimum number of moves: 7\n4. four figures - minimum number of moves: 15\n5. five figures - minimum number of moves: 31\n6. six figures - minimum number of moves: 63\n7. seven figures - minimum number of moves: 127\n8. eight figures - minimum number of moves: 255\n9. nine figures - minimum number of moves: 511</p>",

The players can move and jump over platforms where the monkeys are hanging and moving around. If a player catches a monkey, he has to press the \"action\" button to tag the monkey and throw it in any desired direction. Once tagged, the monkey will become red for a while and try to tag back the player. If the player is tagged, he's out of the game. The game ends when both player characters are tagged.</p>\n<p>The computer keeps track of how many monkeys were tagged. If more than 10 are tagged, the monkeys start to stay red for a longer period of time and it becomes harder for the players to avoid being tagged. The difficulty levels can be skipped without having to score points by pressing the \"+\" key once (for the second level) or twice (for the third).</p>\n<p>The main gameplay is called Monkey Tag! Additional variations can be played by the introduction of keyboard commands:* Tailspin!: by pressing R the players randomize the platforms' position every few seconds. Pressing S will stop it;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Shuteye!: by pressing I the platforms become invisible to the players. Pressing V makes them visible again;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Monkey Chess!: in this variation, one of the players (or an additional one) can edit the playfield by adding or removing bars. To do so, the player types the coordinates of the desired vertical (number, letter) or horizontal (letter, number) bar and press \"clear\" to remove it or \"enter\" to add it.This way \"ladders\" and \"cages\" can be built to help the players;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bananas!: this variation consists in a combination of all the previous ones.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

It is some sort of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a> variation, in which instead of shooting space invaders, the player has to shoot Sid the Spellbinder, a giant segmented snake. Sid comes snaking down the screen and the player has to shoot its segments before it reaches the openings at the lower sides of the screen. The player starts with 30 missiles (20 in skill level 2) and scores in an arithmetic progression: one point for the first segment, two for the second, three for the third and so on, up to 10. If the player's score is below 200, Sid will align its remaining segments together whenever it goes off the screen. If the player's score is 200 or more, the gaps will remain making it harder to the player to shoot Sid. If Sid gets into those openings, it will eat the missiles in the reserve. Sid eats five missiles for each of its segments left when it enters the opening.</p>\n<p>If the player hits all of Sid's segments, or if Sid gets to the lower end of the screen and leaves the player with some missiles after eating, the game changes into a spelling game. The computer will speak a word and the player has to type it in. Each round has 3 words to be spelled and the player has two chances to spell each word. The player earns 10 missiles (5 in skill level 2) for each word spelled correctly. The game is over when all missiles are gone.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Computer Intro!</em>, as the name implies, is a cartridge intended to educate players in the basics of computer programming. It came with a 104 page manual entitled \"A Beginner's Guide to Computer Technology\" featuring a brief history of computers and an introduction to programming techniques. The manual also includes samples of several programs which can be typed in, such as addition programs, one digit multiplication, one digit division, \"Go to Subroutine\" and \"Return\" programs, one digit addition Flash Card Game (which is different from the pre built one), three ways to enter and output a letter, a game where one player enters a six-letter word and another player guesses it and a message program.</p>\n<p>The cartridge comes with three built-in games:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Flash Card (Press 2) is a simple addition game. An addition problem will be displayed and the player has to enter the solution. If the answer is wrong, a \"No\" will appear on screen. If it is right, it will be placed in its right position.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Computer Telepathy (Press 3) is a number guessing game. The player has to guess a number between 00 and 99. If the guess entered is higher than the number, an H will appear beside it. If the number entered is lower, an L will appear. If the number is right, an X will appear.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Between the Sheets (Press 4) is another guessing game. The computer displays three numbers, like 3 7 00. The first two numbers are the sheets and the last two digits are the player's score. If the player thinks the secret number is between 3 and 7, he types \"Yes\", if he thinks it isn't between 3 and 7, he types \"No\". Right answers add 1 point to the score and the number is displayed, wrong answers will be announced by a beep.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is also a demonstration program called Creepy Crawler (Press 1), which consists of a randomized display of flashing blocks.</p>",

The clown has to try to follow the ball as it falls its unpredictable path. A time limit of three \"game minutes\" is counted down and the player with more balls caught by the end of the time wins. The joystick is used to move the clown left or right and the \"action\" button accelerates his movements. There are 6 possible variations, with the players taking turns after each ball caught, taking turns after each miss or in a single player mode, with the time limit on or off for each mode.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Noughts and Crosses</em> is also known as tic-tac-toe. Players move a \"+\" cursor over the 9 square matrix and places either blue noughts or red squares. The first to get three symbols in a straight line wins. If all six symbols have been placed and there's no winner, they can be removed by placing the cursor over and pressing the action button and then be replaced.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

The player selects the game speed (4 to 30 words per minute) and level (1 to all 36 characters available). The computer will play the Morse signal for the first symbol (Q) and the player has to type in the symbol. After learning two signals, the game starts properly by introducing a row of trees in the top of the screen. An arrow is also displayed near the 4th tree from the left and a man on the right side. For each 10 correctly responded symbols the man takes down one tree. When he reaches the arrow, a new symbol is introduced and the process starts over again. The sequence of symbols is: Q, 7, Z, G, 0, 9, 8, O, 1, J, P, W, L, R, A, M, 6, B, X, D, Y, C, K, N, 2, 3, F, U, 4, 5, V, H, S, I, T and E.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The second type lets the player type individual symbols and listen to their respective codes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The third type is similar to the second one, but in this one the player types a sequence of symbols and then press \"enter\" to ask the computer to play the respective code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the fourth type the player uses the \"action\" button of the joystick to enter codes into and the computer plays them and shows the respective symbol entered.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",

        "description": "<p><em>Backgammon</em> is a translation of the board game to the Odyssey\u00b2. The object of the game is to move all checkers off the board. The first player to do so wins. For technical reasons the board is drawn with parallel lines instead of triangles. Points are scored in the following way: a straight win is awarded with 1 point. A \"gammon\" is awarded with 2 points and a \"backgammon\" with 2 points. Players can challenge the opponent for doubling and redoubling the amount of points won. The game can be played using the electronic dice in game or using hand dice. The following variants are available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Match Backgammon for two players (with pip counter) (Press 0): two players select the number of points over which the match will be played. This variation includes a pip counter: it displays the number of pips that have to be rolled for either player to complete the game and get all his checkers off the board.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Match Backgammon for two players (without pip counter) (Press 1): this variation is identical to the previous one, but without the pip counter, which can be reactivated at any time by pressing \"0\" and deactivated again by pressing \"1\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Competitive Backgammon for two players (with pip counter) (Press 2): in this variation, instead of playing towards a predetermined match target, the computer gives a balance between both players and the points they have scored.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Competitive Backgammon for two players (without pip counter) (Press 3).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Match Backgammon for one player, playing against the computer (with pip counter) (Press 4).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Match Backgammon for one player, playing against the computer (without pip counter) (Press 5).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Competitive Backgammon for one player, playing against the computer (with pip counter) (Press 6).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Competitive Backgammon for one player, playing against the computer (without pip counter) (Press 7).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"Dutch\" Backgammon (Press 1 to 7 + \"_\"): in this variety is also known as \"Russian Backgammon\" the checkers start on the bar and have to be brought onto the board, the same as with re-entering.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is also a demo mode available(selected by pressing 6 or 7 + NO).</p>",

A Martian space ship is orbiting the earth and a big laser cannon is being built on Earth and it is the player's mission to hold the Martian threat until the laser cannon is complete. To do so, the SIDO (Space Intruder Defense Organisation) infiltrated a fighting probe inside the Martian spaceship.</p>\n<p>In <em>Martian Threat</em> the player controls a fighting probe with the joystick. The lack of gravity will make the probe keep moving until reverse thrust is given. The player has to shoot Martians and their energy bombs, which will appear in four different spots. The probe can only shoot diagonally. At the start, the Martian bombs are green and have little energy on them. As the game proceeds the bombs turn blue, purple and finally red. The probe can take up to ten hits from green bombs, but only three hits from red bombs. Additionally, the bombs will move faster and when they hit the probe they'll push it away. The probe explodes if it hits the space ship's walls.</p>\n<p>The game has two possible endings. If the player succeeds in defending the Earth for 64 seconds (77 seconds in PAL systems), the laser defense will be finished and Earth will be saved. If the probe gets destroyed before that, the Martians will release their virus bomb and destroy all life on Earth.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Quest for the Rings</em> is a fantasy strategy game using the combination of a game board, tokens, keyboard overlay and the computer to play the game. The game board is used to hide the ten ring tokens with various monster tokens under the castle tokens by the Ringmaster. The keyboard overlay is used by the Ringmaster to interface with the computer when your heroes enter the castles choosing what type of labyrinth in which you will do battle. Combat is controlled by using the computer joysticks.</p>\n<p>There are four heroes: a warrior with a magic sword, a wizard with various spells, a changeling who can become invisible and a phantom who can walk through and hide in walls. The four labyrinths are dungeons, infernoes, crystal caverns and shifting halls. The four monsters are orcs, bloodthirsts (bats), tyrantulus (spiders) and dragons.</p>\n<p>Gameplay pits the Ringmaster against up to four players. The Ringmaster controls the game by hiding the rings, choosing the dungeons and can even enter into combat. Before the game starts the hero players decide how many turns it will take to complete the quest for the ten rings either 50, 75 or 100 turns. Turns are based on castle visits and combat and if you don't complete your quest within the amount of turns you choose you lose. The hero players can start from any designated starting point on the game board and begin their quest for the rings.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Blobbers</em> the player controls a mobile laser unit trying to defend itself from the Blobbers, fearsome, giant, amoeba-like creatures that will devour anything they encounter. The mobile laser unit moves grounded to the sides of the screen area. The Blobbers will also move along the same sides, and as the laser gun can only shoot straight forward, the mobile laser unit has to be in the opposite side of the screen to hit the Blobbers.</p>\n<p>A Blobber is born as a harmless small yellow spot, growing to a bigger and purple mass, to a bigger and white one until it reaches its red adult form. Only when it is red it can do harm to the mobile laser unit, if they are of any other color, they will only stick to the mobile laser unit until it moves and releases itself from the Blobber. As the time passes, an adult Blobber will multiply, releasing a new small yellow spot which will eventually grow into another adult Blobber. When Blobbers are hit, they are reduced to the immediate previous stage of development (from red to white, then purple, then yellow, then deceased).</p>\n<p>In the middle of the screen, moving blocks called Magic Transporters move up and down randomly. They are called Magic Transporters because they can be used to transport the mobile laser unit from one side of the screen to the other, if the mobile laser unit moves onto one of them while they touch the top or bottom of the screen. The Blobbers will also be transported by them. Also, they are impenetrable by the laser gun, meaning the player will only be able to hit one Blobber when there are no Magic Transporters in the laser's way.</p>\n<p>The Blobbers will become faster every 90 seconds until finally reaching the mobile laser unit's speed. The player has only one life and no continues.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Two titles are available in this cart:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Depth Charge</em> is a single-player <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=BattleShip+variants\">BattleShip</a> variant. The player controls a cannon in a top-down view trying to destroy 7 submarines hidden in the area of water shown on screen. The area is a 8x8 grid, and the player controls a white cross-hair over it with the joystick. Pressing the action button will shoot the cannon. If a submarine is hidden in that particular area, a blue square will appear, marking it. If there are no submarines, the game will warn the player with a sound and that area will continue unmarked. There are submarines of 4 different sizes, with there being 3 with one section each, 2 with 2 sections each, 1 with 3 sections and 1 with 4 sections. The game keeps track of the number of shots tried by the player, and the total is shown at the end of the game, when all submarines are destroyed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Marksman</em> is a shooting gallery game. The player can choose between 2 game durations: 1 minute or 3 minutes. The game is played in a first person perspective, with the player seeing the rifle and the targets in front of it. A line of targets will scroll from right to left, bouncing up and down in front of the rifle and the player has to aim at them and shoot. There are 9 different targets which grant the player scores from 1 to 9 points each. When the player reaches 100 points, the targets start to move faster. The game ends when the time reaches 0:00 or when the player runs out of shots (starting with 24).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Great Wall Street Fortune Hunt</em> is another game in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Master+Strategy+Series\">Master Strategy Series</a>, a series of part console, part board games on the Odyssey\u00b2.</p>\n<p>This is a stock exchange simulator. One or two players (or groups, if more than 2 people are playing) take the role of investors (or investment syndicates) trying to anticipate investment fluctuations to take advantage of buying and selling opportunities which occurs during the game.</p>\n<p>The main screen is divided in three sections. The upper section displays the investment choices and prices per share scrolling from right to left. The middle section displays news flashes related to the market and the lower section displays each player's investment portfolio and capital. A grey bar chart to the right displays the overall market performance during each quarter of a year.</p>\n<p>Each investor starts with $100,000 and can enter a maximum of seven investments into the computer. The investments are bought using the keyboard by entering the letters representing it (IBM, for instance) and the number of shares wanted. The shares can be sold in lots of 100. All investments entered must be sold at the end of each year (four quarters, each quarter taking about 5 minutes of real time). The computer will signal the end of each quarter. The winner is the investor accumulating the greatest net worth after 5 years.</p>\n<p>The game can be played in four levels of progressively increased complexity:\n1. Straight Investment Transactions\n2. Straight Investment Transactions &amp; Treasury Bills\n3. Straight Investment Transactions &amp; Treasury Bills &amp; Buying on Margin\n4. Straight Investment Transactions &amp; Treasury Bills &amp; Buying on Margin &amp; Stock Options</p>\n<p>The gameboard is used to keep track of information dealt with off-screen. It is divided in 4 sections: investment positions, T-Bill market, time frame indicator and prime rate indicator.</p>\n<p>Each investor receives a set of numbered share/margin tokens to be placed in the share section of the gameboard for every straight transaction done. There are 30 different investments available and each investment has a different sensitivity to changing national and international conditions in three areas as shown in the gameboard: Gross National Product, Prime Interest Rate and Political Instability. The news flashes presented in the screen will affect the investments according to there three indicators.</p>\n<p>The time frame indicator is used to keep track of which quarter the game is currently on.</p>\n<p>The T-Bill market and Prime Interest Rate parts of the gameboard are only used in level 2 games or higher. The Prime Interest Rate is the interest banks quote as charging their best corporate customers. It is directly related to the interest rate on Treasury Bills. The prime rate will be reported by the news bulletins on the screen and must be marked with the appropriate tokens on the gameboard.</p>\n<p>The level 3 adds the option of buying stocks on margin, i.e., with money borrowed from the broker. The computer only keeps track of investments bought in cash, so this kind of transaction must be tracked with the help of a proper token in the gameboard.</p>\n<p>The level 4 adds option trades to the game. Options give the investor the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell securities at current prices at the beginning of the following quarter. It is basically a bet about the rise or fall of a specific security price.</p>\n<p>Besides the gameboard, each player has his/her own investment record pad to better keep track of his/her transactions.</p>",

Each country's military and diplomacy power is reflected by its real life counterpart during the early 1980's. Each country's relationship with one another is also reflected by how it is in real life.</p>\n<p>Gameplay involves the use of a gameboard. Gameplay done on the game board contains information which is then entered into the Odyssey 2 for it to handle. Inside the game itself, players do battle by land, air, and sea. Battles involve players controlling either a jet (air force), tank (army), or a submarine (navy) and then battling the other player's jet, tank, or submarine. These vehicles are dependent on supplies which are displayed as energy units. Every shot fired and movement made drains the player's energy units. The battle ends when all the energy units run out. These combat results are then recorded on the gameboard, which then spurs further entries into the Odyssey 2.</p>\n<p>Every battle won and alliance made will increase a country's power. The country with the most power at the end of the game wins.</p>\n<p>Besides the gameboard map itself, the game also comes with 100 power base unit indicators, a Homeland Marker, and six sets of Conquest/Alliance markers.</p>",

The game also lets the player set up an \"alarm\" message which can pop up every 30 seconds. The player can also set a digital clock to keep track of time.</p>\n<p>The instruction manual suggests the following games that can be played:</p>\n<p>Movie Madness!: 1 player names a movie and it's up to the other player to type in as many people that are associated with that movie. The main objective is to fill in as many characters (up to 99) of the main message as possible within an agreed amount of time. Then player 2 takes his turn and the player with the most characters filled in wins.</p>\n<p>Sportscaster!: Played the same way as Movie Madness, except this time involves naming players of sports teams instead.</p>\n<p>Identograms!: One player enters a series of clues on a subject and the other player has a limited amount of time to identify the subject. If the subject is displayed on the screen before the player guesses it, the player loses the game.</p>\n<p>Source Word!: One player names a source word and the other player has only 5 minutes to type in as many word variations as they can by using only the letters contained in the source word. The words may be of any length but no letter can be used more than it appears in the source word. Then player 2 takes his turn and the player with the most characters filled in wins.</p>\n<p>Tell Tale!: Players take turns entering words of a sentence. A player completing the sentence before the 98th character is out of the game. A player unable to complete a sentence on exactly the 98th space is out of the game. The game continues until only one player is left. If a player ends the sentence on exactly the 98th space, that player is the winner of the game.</p>\n<p>Nincompoop!: Player 1 names any vowel the Nincompoop. Then players take turns entering words of increasing length (from 2-5 characters, then the cycle repeats). Anytime the Nincompoop vowel is used the player types Nincompoop in, instead of the vowel that would usually belong there. A player who cannot fit a word of the required length into the 99th space is out of the game. After that player is eliminated, the game starts with anew. The last surviving player is the winner.</p>\n<p>Chain Letters!: One player names a category then types in a word that would fit in that category. Then the next player has to type in a word that starts with the last letter of that word that still fits in the current category. A player breaking the letter chain is out of the game and the surviving players continue.until only one player is left, or until a player ends a chain on exactly the 99th space. If a player cannot name a category word that fits into the 99th space, that player loses. A new category is selected after that, with the other surviving players continuing on the game. </p>\n<p>Quiz Wiz!: One player programs a series of math problems for the other player to solve in a limited amount of time. The player wins if they arrive at the answer before it appears on the screen.</p>",

The cook places a meal in the dumb-waiter and Maxime has to get it when it passes by the floor where he's standing in an elevator shaft.</p>\n<p>Customers get angry for waiting for too long. They arrive green, but turn red as they grow angrier and finally start jumping in their places when they're really furious. If Maxime serves them, they'll return to their calm (green) state and will leave. If Maxime fails to serve them when their furious, they'll leave. If four customers leave unserved, the game is over.</p>\n<p>To make things a bit more difficult, a dog enters the restaurant every now and then, trying to steal Maxime's tray. If Maxime has his hands free, he'll kick the dog out; if he's carrying his tray, the dog will bite Maxime's legs, making him fall, and will steal the tray.</p>",

The weapon, sometimes called \"Archimedes heat ray\" consisted of a mirror used to focus sunlight onto approaching Roman ships, setting them on fire.</p>\n<p>This is a game for two players. One player controls Archimedes as he uses the mirror to reflect the sunlight at the Roman galleys. The other player controls the Roman galleys as they try to reach the base of the tower where Archimedes stands, to land troops at Syracuse. The galleys can catapult rocks to destroy Archimedes' mirror in order to approach the tower without risk. The longer the player holds the button, the farther the rock goes; the rocks can also have its route altered during flight if the player moves the joystick up or down. If the mirror is broken, Archimedes can get a new one by leaving off the right side of the screen. Archimedes can move the mirror up or down to aim the reflection against one of the three approaching galleys. If a galley is hit twice by the sunlight, it will catch fire, and a new one will appear on the left side of the screen to replace it. The number of mirrors broken and galleys sunk is registered in the lower side of the screen.</p>\n<p>Each game can last one whole day, from sunrise to sunset (8 minutes in real time). The sun rises in the left and sets in the right, and sometimes a cloud passes by, blocking some sun rays. The game can end in three ways: when the time runs out, when one player scores 99 points or when the three galleys reach the bottom of the tower. There are 4 game variations, with different sunbeam speeds, mirror position numbers, rock speeds and trajectory modification.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Interpol</em> is a game for two players, one controls two spies (red characters) and the other controls two police officers (blue characters). The spies are in possession of secret information and must try to leave the country with them, by air or by sea. The police officers have to stop their plan. The airport and the port are blocked by the police, and individuals interested in traveling must present a code which only the police knows.</p>\n<p>The main screen represents a town, with U-shaped boxes with numbers from one to nine inside representing buildings. At the beginning of the game, the player controlling the police must define the code which blocks the airport and port (represented by an airplane and a ship). The code must be a word of five letters. As the player enters each letter, he or she must assign a building to store that letter, by entering its number. Once all letters are stored, the game begins. The player controlling the spies must choose one of them and start moving around the town searching for the letters. While moving, the selected spy becomes invisible so the police officer won't see which way the spy takes. At one turn, movement can only be vertical or horizontal, so if the player chooses to move horizontally, he or she will only be able to move vertically in the next turn. At the bottom of the screen, a red character will be shown walking and little green bars will pass him by, telling how many \"spaces\" he has moved. Each turn may last five to 60 seconds, depending on the choice the players made at the beginning of the game (different durations can be set for each player). The turn ends when the time is over or when the player presses a button. The player controlling the police officers chooses one of them and starts moving, trying to catch the spies. When the player thinks the police character is in the same space the spy is, he or she must press the action button. If the spy is really there, he is captured, if not, the player controlling the police officers just ends his or her turn.</p>\n<p>The game ends when the police captures both spies or when one of the spies gets to the airport or the port and enters the correct word.</p>",

Press 2: Squash, two players, low ball speed (left controller, blue, goes first);\n4. Press 3: Squash, two players, high ball speed (left controller, blue, goes first);\n5. Press 4: Tennis, two players, low ball speed (right controller, red, goes first);\n6. Press 5: Tennis, two players, high ball speed (right controller, red, goes first);\n7.

Press 8: Pong Classic (Tennis), two players (right controller goes first);\n10. Press 9: Pong-Analog (Squash), one player;\n11. Press Space: Pong-Analog (Tennis), two players (right controller goes first);</p>\n<p>The six first variations have Voice enhanced sound, the players can move their pads in all eight directions, the action button speeds up the pad movement and there are two ball speeds available: slow (pressing 1 during gameplay) and fast (pressing 2 during gameplay. The game ends when one of the players has reached a score of 40 points.</p>\n<p>The Classic Pong variations are based off of the Pong: AY-3-8500, a popular Pong chip made by GI and used in several Pong consoles. In these variations, there's no Voice enhanced sound, the pads can only be moved vertically, the action button speeds up the pad movement and there are two ball speeds available: slow (pressing 1 during gameplay) and fast (pressing 2 during gameplay. In the two players Squash game the players must take turns while beating the ball. In all Classic Pong variations the game ends when the score reaches 15.</p>\n<p>The Pong-Analog variations are based on the Pong: ES2201 style game, which was an early analog Pong game made by Philips, also called \"Telespiel\". In these games there are 6 ball speeds: pressing 1 decreases the speed and pressing 2 increases it. There is no score or time, and when the ball leaves the playfield it must be served with the action button.</p>",

The player has to land the ship on as many planets as possible with a given amount of fuel. To land, the player has to adjust the ship to be in a vertical position, nose up, with the X and Y gauges green when it touches the landing pad. Landing at any other place of the planet's surface, or with the X or Y gauges red, or with the ship not vertical will result in a crash landing. Flying off-screen will restart the level, but with less fuel. Each new planet is more challenging, with higher gravity force and eventually a smaller landing pad.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Two titles are available in this cart:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Mission Impossible</em> is an action game. The player must protect a cargo ship (white craft) which travels on a lay lines from bounty hunters (red crafts), which will destroy the cargo ship if they cross its way. As the cargo ship moves along the lay lines, the player must place NGR bots (green X symbols) at the lay line intersections to change traffic; the player has 7 NGR bots and can replace them. When any ships reaches an NGR bot, it will turn right if traveling vertically or turn toward the bottom of the screen when traveling horizontally. Red mushroom-shaped power ups, when picked up allow the cargo ship to destroy the bounty hunters; alternatively, bounty hunters can be simply directed to them and will be destroyed. White X marks will send the cargo ship back in the opposite way it was traveling; if hit by a bounty hunter, they will also send them back, but will be destroyed. Lilac squares are mines which will destroy any ship that passes over them. Finally, blue dots will give bounty hunters an extra life if taken by them. The player and the bounty hunters start with 15 lives each, the first to drop to zero loses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Programmed Trip</em> is a turn based game which shares many elements from the previous game. As the name implies, the player has to program the trip of the cargo field so it passes over pickup points (colored + symbols) in a specific order: first lilac, then red, then blue. To do so, NGR bots can be placed to redirect the ship, and some fields may also have White X marks already placed. After all desired NGR bots are placed, the player can release the cargo ship by placing the cursor over the upper left corner and pressing the action button. When the cargo ship is released the player has 30 points. Passing over pickup points in the correct order adds 20 points to the score, while passing over them in the wrong order or hitting any other item (NGR bots or white X marks, for instance) subtracts 10 points from the score. The game is over either when the score reaches 0 or when all pickup points were reached in the right order (in which case they'll turn white).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p><em>Des Chiffres et des Lettres</em> is a game based on the French TV show of the same name. The game comprises two rounds, which can be played together or independently. They are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Le compte est bon</strong>: players have to arrive at a target number using the four arithmetic operations applied to 6 numbers chosen randomly by the computer (which can be 1 to 10; 25; 50; 75; 100). First the two players enter their initials and the computer will decide who plays first. Four series of 6 numbers are stored in the computer's memory and are drawn by the players by typing the numbers 1 to 4. Once a series is selected, it is shown at the screen, as well as the target result, and the players have 45 seconds to think about the answer. When the time is over, the player designated by the computer has 15 seconds to enter the result he or she arrived by typing it and then demonstrate its calculus. This is done by typing the numbers and operations between then. Once the numbers are used they are removed from the screen. If the player doesn't reach the exact match, the other player has the chance to enter his calculations. The winner is the player who reaches the most proximate result, earning 6 points, or the exact result (\"le compte est bon\"), earning 8 points. In case of error, the adversary earns the points.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Le mot le plus long</strong>: from 9 random letters, the players have to compose the longest word possible. First the two players enter their initials and the computer will decide who plays first. Then the players take turns choosing if the next letter will be a consonant (by typing C) or a vowel (by typing V). After all 9 letters are drawn, the timer starts and the players have 45 seconds to think of an answer. When the time is over, the player designated by the computer has 15 seconds to enter how many letters his or her word has (by typing 0 to 9). The player with the best result then types his solution. If the word is valid, he or she scores as many points as the number of letters in the word. In case of error, the adversary earns the points.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The game can be played against the computer or by two human players. Each player has 10 turns in each game. If the players decide to play the complete game, the rounds will be played alternately.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the year 8048 mankind has been annihilated by the computers and machines they've built. Now, the machines started fighting each other, and two factions remain, red and blue.</p>\n<p><em>Mr. Roboto!</em> is a strategy game with real time action combat. The map screen consists of a 7x7 grid, with the two factions sided at the lower-left and upper-right corners. Each side has a CPU and 6 robot warrior servants, the object being moving one of the robots to the opponent's CPU and shutting it down. At each turn, players have the option of moving one robot or issuing a command for the CPU. The robots can only move one square per turn, and if they move to a square occupied by an enemy unity, the game changes to a battle screen. CPU commands include SKIP (to end the turn) and EXIT (to cancel and select other unit) and three attack virus that can be used against enemy robots: HALT (stops the robot for 3 turns), SLOW (halves the battle speed of a robot for 3 turns) or HALF (halves the power of a robot permanently). Each virus can be used only once.</p>\n<p>When a robot enters the square occupied by an enemy robot, the game zooms in into the battle screen. Here, the two robots appear armed with Energy Discs, as well as two Power Surges, which circle the screen. The goal is to destroy the enemy robot, and to do so, players have to throw the Energy Discs by moving the joystick to the desired direction and press the action button. The Energy Disc keeps ricocheting until it hits a Power Surge. If it touches the enemy robot, it will drain one unit of its power. Touching the Power Surges also drains power. Once one of the robots is destroyed, the game goes back to the map screen.</p>\n<p>When a robot enters the square occupied by the enemy CPU, the game zooms into a different battle screen. At this screen, the CPU is shown at the lower-left corner and the enemy robot is shown at the top of the screen. Six rows of firewalls are in the way of the enemy robot, which must avoid them to reach the CPU. The CPU can use a horizontal missile to try to stop the robot. If the robot reaches the CPU and touches it, the game is over.</p>",

At first, hitting the bumpers adds 75 points to the score, but as the bumpers change colors when hit, the amount of points scored increase. The bumpers start red, then change to green, orange, dark blue, pink, light blue, white, black and then red again. The table can also be nudged by moving the joystick in the desired nudge direction. Each player has 5 balls to play.</p>\n<p>The second game mode allows players to design their own table by placing the 7 bumpers in any desired position.

There are three variations, selected by pressing \"reset\" and the desired number, as follows:\n1. <strong>MelRep</strong>: the object is to sort the figures 1 to 9 in ascending order, from left to right. The figures appear scrambled in a random order, and the player must move pairs of figures, by switching their positions. Two sets of arrows, one above and one below, show which figures will be changed. The arrows can only be placed in 4 possible positions. The player has to try to assemble the figures with the minimum amount of moves possible. There are 9 difficulty levels, selected in the beginning of the game.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reverse</strong>: this variation is similar to the previous one. Once again the object is to sort the numbers in ascending order, from left to right. After selecting the difficulty (from 2 to 9, 2 for a game of 2 figures and 9 for a game of nine figures), the player has to sort them by reversing the order of a given number of figures. To do so, the player enters the number of figures to be reversed in the numeric keyboard. The computer then reverses the number of figures entered, counting from left to right. So, if the player presses \"3\", the computer will reverse the first three figures; if 5 is pressed, the first five figures will be reversed. The player has to try to assemble the figures with the minimum amount of moves possible; the higher the number entered, the more moves are needed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Countdown</strong>: the object is, from a number given by the computer, to reach the number \"01\" before the opponent does, by taking turns subtracting a number from the starting one. This game has 6 variations, selected at the start of the game by pressing one of the following numbers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>one player, random starting number, player goes first, selectable maximum number to be subtracted (from 3 to 9);</li>\n<li>two players, random starting number, right player goes first, selectable maximum number to be subtracted (from 3 to 9);</li>\n<li>one player, the starting number is 23, player goes first, maximum number to be subtracted is 3;</li>\n<li>one player, random starting number, computer goes first, selectable maximum number to be subtracted (from 3 to 9);</li>\n<li>two players, random starting number, left player goes first, selectable maximum number to be subtracted (from 3 to 9);</li>\n<li>one player, the starting number is 23, computer goes first, maximum number to be subtracted is 3.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>",

Player take turns typing in words until a sentence is created by one of the players adding a period. Players then take turns inserting words into the sentence, while trying to keep it grammatically correct. The first player to extend the sentence exactly to the end of the available typing space is the winner. If a player extends the sentence beyond the end of that available space, they lose.</p>",
