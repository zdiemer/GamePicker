The gameplay is dynamic, as levels are built based on the content of the user's iPod. For every song, the game creates a new, custom challenge, similar to the earlier iPod game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/31478/musika/\">musika</a>. The screen shows a 3D road consisting of 3 white lines, disappearing into the distance, and three circles near the bottom of the screen. As the notes (discs and dots) appear from the top of the lines, players need to match them in the circles by tapping the clickwheel (left - center - right), or gliding the it to catch flowing sweeps. Various backdrops are rendered along the road with different characters and environments.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Guitar Hero games, the music does not stop when a mistake is made. Every song is divided into different checkpoints and the player's performance is ranked by stars. If too many notes are missed, the game ends prematurely and the player loses a life. Long streaks result into combos and the game also shows the overall accuracy and total score.</p>\n<p>There are 2 gameplay modes: QuickSpin (a single song at a time) and Marathon (a session of 5 songs with an increasing difficulty).</p>",

The core concept is interactive music visualization with the addition of gameplay elements. Before starting, a selection of music on the iPod is made based on playlists, individual songs, genres or artists, along with three difficulty levels: Casual, Active and Intense.</p>\n<p>While the song is playing, letters appear on the screen based on a wide range of distorted effects. When a character flashes up that is part of the song title, players need to press the centre button to confirm. Based on the speed and accuracy, a score is rewarded. When the character is not part of the title, the skip forward/back buttons need to be pressed. Make a mistake (letting a character pass or a mistake), and blocks are added to the song title shown at the bottom of the screen, which need to be removed again.</p>\n<p>When every character has been hit five times, the songs ends. Getting multiple correct character in a row leads to score multipliers and there are bonuses such as almighty (shield that protects against misses, passes and blocks), de-block (remove all blocks), double clear points (2x multiplier) and double score. Album art is shown in the bottom left corner of the screen and the level progress in the top right. Players can tweak the visual effects and add a custom message shown during gameplay.

Ziggy is a Conductor, one who has the power to summon warriors called Tune Troopers by playing music. The player summons Tune Troopers by selecting songs on their iPod, which are then randomly transformed into one of 50 characters. Each Trooper is given a ranking of bronze, gold, silver or platinum, which determines how many battles they can be sent to fight in. Listening to a song from which a Tune Trooper was summoned will increase that character's stats.</p>",
