However, the environmental damage has also increased beyond anything the human had imagined. It was then that the disaster occurred: a huge floating fortress appeared on the Earth's orbit, and the self-proclaimed \"Beast Empire\" of monsters began invading the planet. Soon, a whole continent was destroyed. Humanity was on the verge of destruction. Only a special unit of agents trained and infused with the latest bio- and technological achievements can stop the monster invasion. The leader of this organization sends a group under the command of the young soldier Abel to investigate a location where the previously sent team disappeared without trace...</p>\n<p><em>Abel</em> is a turn-based Japanese-style RPG set in a dark futuristic environment. The player commands Abel and his teammates from the headquarters, where they can rest, receive items, and prepare for the next mission. The missions themselves take place in large dungeon-like areas. Randomly appearing enemies must be defeated in first-person perspective combat with a rather standard system: characters either attack physically, use items, or execute special attacks that require \"special points\" (equivalent to magic). There is also an Auto option for battles.</p>",

The second game contains minor differences compared to the original, primarily in enemy design. The first game, however, has undergone more significant gameplay-related changes. The difficulty level has been reduced, and the powerful capsule weapon Betty is available to the protagonist from the beginning (as opposed to mid-game in the original release).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Zan II: Towns Special</em> is an installment in the Zan series primarily based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/47230/zan-kagero-no-toki/\">Zan: Kager\u014d no Toki</a>. The setting (Japanese Sengoku period) and main gameplay mechanics are identical. However, this version allows the player to recreate specific scenarios from the historical era, taking place between 1550 and 1600. Four scenarios of varied difficulty are available. </p>\n<p>Like other Zan games, this entry is a turn-based grand strategy game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Koei\">Koei's</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=romance+of+the+three+kingdoms\">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a> series. The player takes control of a ruler or general in a chosen province of Japan, trying to govern his own country by keeping its inhabitants happy, and gaining the upper hand in the struggle for dominance, be it through diplomatic manoeuvres or military actions. Combat takes place on separate isometric screens and allows the player to input detailed commands for the army.</p>",

Koshinaka's research of the data bank on board the Diabolique, a stealth aircraft carrier of the United Nations, is aimed at increasing the life adjustment factor of bionic soldiers. However, members of the Einheit assault the laboratory, and the bionic soldier Blon-Win must decipher the clues left in order to proceed with the research and confront a mysterious person named Rua Rip Salisbury in the Original Matrix.</p>\n<p>Gameplay-wise, this installment is a departure from any format introduced in the previous entries. It is essentially an interactive movie with semi-animated voiced cutscenes occupying the bulk of the game. The player is required to choose the correct character and perform the correct action within a time limit during each scene. Failing to comply with the time limit will subtract a small quantity of the \"Life\" bar, while choosing a wrong action will normally reduce it by an even larger amount. Once the Life bar is depleted the game is over.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Judge Badnack, one of the few remnants of the WWWF, is determined to restore that criminal organization to former glory. He takes control of the assault satellite belonging to the United Nations, and kidnaps Zero to attain his goal. However, the Einheit organization sends Badnack's ex-lover Arnette Penzias to further their own agenda. Blon-Win and Dalzy must once again use their wits and their bionic powers to rescue Zero and put an end to evil schemes. </p>\n<p><em>Wyatt</em> is the seventh entry in The 4th Unit series and a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/58087/merrygoround-the-4th-unit-series/\">Merrygoround</a>. Gameplay-wise, it is similar to its immediate predecessor, with presentation and gameplay elements reminiscent of an interactive cartoon. Like in the previous game, the player must select actions within time limit to advance the story, and may run out of \"lives\" if the time limit has been breached or too many wrong choices were made. Unlike the predecessor, possible actions are performed with command icons rather than selection from text menus.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Gekirin</em> is a self-described \"RPG without a story\". The player takes the role of a nameless male adventurer in an abstract medieval town, equipped with basic weapons and armor. The bulk of the game takes place in a gigantic multi-story overhead randomly generated dungeon. The protagonist explores the dungeon in search of a precious sword, descending deeper and deeper, looting treasure chests, and fighting respawning enemies in action-oriented combat, which grants him experience points.</p>\n<p>Ranged and melee weapons are available, as well as attack items (bombs etc.) and special items (such as keys that unlock new areas). Equipment and items can be bought in the town's stores. The hero's weapons and armor rapidly deteriorate and must be repaired or exchanged for new ones when their rating reaches zero. It is also possible to attack walls, carving alternate pathways through the dungeon. When the protagonist dies he is teleported back to the town and the player can attempt to tackle the dungeon again.</p>",

The hero used its power to build the country of everyone's dreams, where peace and prosperity reigned supreme. However, an evil magician has usurped the power of the sword and used it to unleash monster minions on the kingdom. A new hero has risen, determined to enter the depths of the dungeon and rid the land of evil.</p>\n<p>The sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/58188/gekirin-ushinawareshi-hoken/\">Gekirin</a> is nearly identical to its predecessor gameplay-wise. Like the previous game, it is an action-oriented dungeon crawler that predominantly takes place in randomized mazes full of respawning enemies. All the features of the original game - breakable weapons, magic, destructible walls, etc. - return in the sequel. New weapons, armor, and item types have been added.</p>",

The first mode allows the player to view profiles and photos of twelve models (five photos per model). These photos are sexually suggestive, but contain no nudity. It is possible to interact with the pictures by moving a hand-shaped cursor over them.</p>\n<p>The second mode is a photo-shooting simulation game in which the player chooses one of the four available models as well as one of the several photographers, each with their own parameters. The session is timed and the photographer has to choose the right things to say in order to keep the girl in a good mood. Erotic photos (this time with partial nudity) can be then taken and saved to an album.</p>\n<p>The third mode is a simple sex simulation game. The player chooses between two young women, selects a few conditions for the sex scene, and then presses various keys to stimulate the woman. There is, however, no explicit sex situations in the game, the viewing area consisting only of a digitized photo of a semi- or fully nude woman.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Hong Kong no Mashu</em> is based on the manga <em>Lupin the 3rd</em> and is built like an episode in the series, assuming the player's familiarity with the characters. The central character is the grandson of the fictional \"gentleman thief\" Ars\u00e8ne Lupin, who follows the same profession, traveling in search of riches and adventure with his companion Daisuke Jigen, an expert marksman. Joining them in this episode is Goemon Ishikawa XIII, a descendant of the legendary Japanese swordsman. Finding themselves in Hong Kong for different reasons, the heroes encounter an evasive and mysterious character with a dark past who crosses their paths and forces them to take action.</p>\n<p>The game consists of two stories accessible from the main menu. In the first the player controls Jigen, while the protagonist of the second is Ishikawa. The game's structure resembles that of a visual novel: the gameplay is mostly restricted to selecting the right choice among several available ones. These decision prompts are fairly frequent, and making the wrong choice would sometimes lead to Game Over. In addition, in the beginning of each chapter the player must select three items from a list, which will become available as valid choices during correspondent scenes.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Misty</em> is a detective mystery adventure game set in modern-day Japan and starring the young private investigator Ry\u016b Kamishiro. The game consists of nine unrelated cases that can be accessed in any order from the main menu. These cases range from seemingly mundane matters to thefts, mysterious disappearances and murder investigations.</p>\n<p>This installment in the series differs from the others by introducing full-screen digitized photos for all the locations (as opposed to the text-only majority of other Misty releases). There are also many more unique images instead of generic areas as well as hand-drawn character graphics in many scenes. </p>\n<p>This release contains all the five cases of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/58524/misty-vol1/\">Misty Vol.1</a>: <em>Strange Naked Body</em>, <em>Red Fountain</em>, <em>Murderer's Laboratory</em>, <em>Tail Lights Disappearing in the Old City</em> and <em>Decaying Family Tree</em>. In addition, it contains four cases exclusive to this version: <em>Moving Target</em>, <em>The Young Lady's Abduction</em>, <em>Letter from the Red Spider</em> and <em>Final Countdown</em>.</p>\n<p>The player is presented with a graphical map of locations in the city, and much of the gameplay is dedicated to repeatedly visiting them, searching areas and questioning suspects. The gameplay is somewhat more relenting than in other Misty games, allowing re-visiting more locations without penalties.</p>\n<p>It is possible to accuse suspects and attempt to solve the case at any point, though doing so without sufficient evidence will result in failure. The game saves the progress automatically; it is possible to restart the investigation only by deleting the save file.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Hyper Classic Operation</em> is a turn-based sci-fi strategy game focusing entirely on battles between the Earth Federation and Zeon. The game has two campaigns, 0079 and 0087, corresponding to the years in which two major wars of the Gundam universe took place: the first war against the Principality of Zeon and the conflict between various factions (including the Axis Zeon, the first of the Neo Zeon organizations) eight years later. The player can either go through the battles of each campaign in a linear fashion (Campaign Mode), or choose between different battles (Scenario Mode); the latter includes two-player gameplay as well.</p>\n<p>The player may assign and customize various pilots before each battle. The battles themselves are predominantly tactical, consisting mainly of navigation and attacking, without resource management. Units may consist of space ships, infantry, droids, mechas, etc. An automatic battle between two units ensues when any of them chooses to attack the other. There are also light role-playing elements such as levels for individual units.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Hyper Desert Operation</em> can be considered a \"twin game\" of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/58538/mobile-suit-gundam-hyper-classic-operation/\">Mobile Suit Gundam: Hyper Classic Operation</a>. It is nearly identical to the other game in setting, gameplay, and visuals. Like <em>Hyper Classic Operation</em>, the game consists of two major campaigns, 0079 and 0087, corresponding to two famous wars in Gundam universe. The player can once again choose between a linear progression through a campaign and individual scenarios within each.</p>\n<p>The scenarios themselves, however, are completely different. Unlike <em>Hyper Classic Operation</em>, all the scenarios take place on planet surfaces rather than in space. As the title suggests, desert terrain plays indeed an important role; however, some of the scenarios are set in grassland areas, sometimes surrounded by water, etc. The game also features different unit types and places a stronger emphasis on base defense and management.</p>",

Due to unforeseen radioactivity and diseases spread by a new virus, the survivors have turned into horrifying mutants, and corpses were reanimated as zombies. The few remaining humans had to live underground, from where they attempt to continue their resistance. Keiko Kirihara, the only female member of their small armed force, is sent to find a route to a safer location, which lies in the city's dangerous areas.</p>\n<p><em>Rejection</em> is a hybrid of a shooter and a role-playing game. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective, and much of it is spent in maze-like areas. It cannot be considered a first-person shooter in the sense of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Wolfenstein+3D\">Wolfenstein 3D</a>, however, since the graphics are pseudo-3D and the movement is step-based and not fluent. Keiko can use a variety of firearms and melee weapons (such as knives). Health kits and ammunition can be found in the stages. Enemies would often respawn to give the player the opportunity to level up Keiko, since experience points are awarded for defeating them.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Super Shooting Towns</em> is a fairly simple horizontally-scrolling shooter. The player controls a flying mechanical bug-like device that has to fight its way through levels populated by various organic (predominantly insect-like) creatures. There is no permanent secondary weapon, and the relatively infrequent power-ups may either switch the properties of the main weapon temporarily or enhance it (e.g. enable backwards shooting).</p>\n<p>The game's stand-out feature is the included editor. This utility allows players to design and customize their own side-scrolling shooter levels. It is possible to draw maps as well as change the parameters of the enemies, affecting the difficulty of the stage.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Alltynex</em> is a vertically-scrolling shoot' em up. It's a doujin game developed by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Satoshi+Yoshida\">Satoshi Yoshida</a> in 1996. He entered it in the 2nd ASCII Entertainment Software Contest (also known as A-con) held in 1996 and won the prize in the PC software category. As a result, the game was included on a CD that came with the magazine Login Softcon. In 1997 version 1.01 was released as freeware on the developer's website.</p>\n<p>The story is about a supercomputer ALLTYNEX that goes rogue and decides to wage a war on all of mankind. The player controls a fighter spacecraft which can also transform into a mecha that has more powerful weapons but is generally slower. The standard fighter has an upgradeable spread shot and the secondary weapon is a homing laser. In mecha form there's a very powerful but short range sword while the secondary weapon is a big laser. Secondary weapons use an energy meter that drains as the weapon is fired. It charges as more things are destroyed or damaged. Also, as long as the player has collected at least one main weapon power-up, the first enemy hit will not destroy the player's craft, but instead reduce power-up level to zero. There are five stages in total. Two player mode is also available.</p>\n<p>The game was remade with polygonal graphics as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/102167/alltynex-second/\">Alltynex Second</a>, released on August 14, 2010 at Summer Comiket 78.</p>",
