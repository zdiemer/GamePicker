However it is not a direct port since the game has been simplified to an extreme degree, the graphics of the characters are also now done in a chibi style, and the violence has been heavily toned down.</p>\n<p>Gameplay modes include One Player, Survival, and VS mode. Options let the player choose the difficulty level, points needed to win, and the amount of time per round (for both the player and their opponent for the latter two options).</p>",
