        "description": "<p><em>Top Chrono</em> is a racing game taking place on a one-way road along with other sport cars. The player sees the road from a driver's seat. He can accelerate, brake and turn the car left or right. The goal is to finish four tracks for a limited time. During the correct driving, the time is increased in a normal way, but each collision with another car or with the road's edge adds a penalty time to the player's score, which is called \"chrono\" in this game. The \"chrono\" is finalized on completing all four stages, which also leads to a power-station explosion. Best \"chronos\" are stored in the top three table.</p>",
