Despite the Egyptian setting, there are numerous modern elements and items used for comical effect.</p>\n<p>The game uses a classic point-and-click interface. The mouse is used to move around and actions (Use, Look, Pick up, Talk, Give, and Open) can be selected at the bottom of the screen. Domi can pick up various items and store them in an inventory, shown in the bottom right of the screen. It is possible to talk to NPCs and select from multiple dialogue options.</p>",

The player takes the role of a leading expert on demolition and salvage who is out on a mission at a research station beneath the surface of Mars. Rockfalls have caused damage to the base and it's up to the player to clear up the blockages so that repairs can begin. </p>\n<p>The game consists of 32 levels and the player's objective is to clear all the rockfalls from each of them as well as all hostilities that may roam around. Once this has been done an exit opens up and the player will be able to progress to the next level. The player is equipped with an explosive generating backpack that uses energy cells to charge bombs. To remove rockfall the bomb is simply dropped near it and the player has to get out of its range quickly to avoid getting caught in the explosion. Sometimes the destroyed rocks will reveal extra cells for the backpack. These grant the player larger explosions, more bombs, and other abilities. Those abilities include pushing, pulling, and throwing bombs. More powerful bombs include rebound bombs that create huge explosions and flower bombs that can spread around corners. Some cells are unknown and the player has to pick them up to know what they do. The consequences of these can be both good like extra lives and bad like fuel leaks.</p>\n<p>Various enemies wander around the levels. There are security droids that can disarm bombs, spirits that can pass through blockades, and wandering bombs that explode when getting close to the player. There are also floating energy creatures that will kill, set off bombs, and light fuel leaks on contact. They can not be killed with explosions. Instead, the player needs a plasma protection suit utility cell to be able to destroy them. Other level features are harmless. There are indestructible objects like walls and machinery, conveyors that can be used to transport bombs, and drains that can be used to stop the burning trails from fuel leaks. There are also pipe networks that explosions can travel through and thereby cause larger explosions.</p>\n<p>In addition to the single-player mode, the game also features a multiplayer mode for two to four players. There are eight multiplayer arenas to pick from. The aim is simply to kill the other players.</p>",

The player is an expert in rock blasting and salvage work whose task is to prevent the destruction of the moon by removing all the rocks obstructing its air ventilation systems. This is done by placing bombs to clear out all the rocks. In the base, there are two types of nuclear reactors that the player has to be careful around. Red and blue reactors can take one blast but yellow and green reactors must not be hit all. Too many hits and a large atomic explosion will happen. Around the base, the player will also come across security droids whose control circuits have been disabled. Contact with them is lethal, although they can be taken out with bombs. When starting out the player's backpack can generate one bomb of low power. However, by collecting extra energy cells the player will be able to place multiple bombs with more power and range. There are also energy cells with unknown effects, for example, invincibility for a short time or stopping of time. The objective of the multiplayer mode is simply to kill the second player. It is played locally on the same computer.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The legendary Pandora's Box has been opened, causing an entire kingdom to be poisoned by the evil that is unleashed. Once freed, this evil being seeks the souls of men and possesses them. By doing so it brings misery, treachery, and corruption to the kingdom. Only one person, the greatest sorcerer of the lands, can overcome its dark magic and once again trap the evil beast in the box. </p>\n<p><em>Pandora's Box</em> is an isometric arcade adventure and as such it features both puzzle-solving and fighting. The game's world is open-ended and consists of over 200 interconnected screens. The goal is to close Pandora's Box by collecting four emerald seals. Most of the gameplay involves exploring the world in search of various objects that are needed to progress. Some objects can simply be picked up from the ground while others can only be acquired by solving puzzles or trading with NPCs. Some characters also send the player out on errands in exchange for a reward. Often these fetch quests where the player has to bring back certain objects. Puzzles generally involve activating objects at the right location or to combine them with other objects. Clues and quests are given on parchments that the player can find all around the world. The player takes damage when bumping into certain characters. At the start of the game, the player is unarmed and can't defend himself but after doing some puzzles weapons will become available. Weapons are equipped from an inventory (consisting of a maximum of eight objects) and are used with the same action button that is used for puzzles. Since the player is a sorcerer he can also create magical staffs and scrolls by mixing different objects in a cauldron.</p>",

The inhabitants of the moon, the Poloids, have been kidnapped and are being held as hostages. Galactic Dan Quicksmart, an agent of the United Planets Bureau of Investigations is being sent to the moon to rescue the hostages. On his mission, he has to search through ruined cities, cave dwellings, and Vorian installations while watching out for the robot guardians that are programmed to kill anyone that opposes them.</p>\n<p><em>Galactic Dan</em> is an early first-person shooter featuring ray-traced graphics. The game is controlled with the mouse that the player uses to shoot, run, jump and look around. There are 24 maze-like levels and the objective of each of them is to rescue a set number of hostages and find the exit before the time runs out. At the same time, the player has to shoot down or avoid the many enemies that guard the hostages. The mission is failed when the player's energy reaches zero or when time runs out. The player gets a score based on how hostages are rescued, enemies killed and time left. It's possible to save more hostages than are required to finish the level.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Bug Hunter / Moon Dash</em> is a collection of two games on one disk, both previously unreleased.</p>\n<p>In <em>Bug Hunter</em> the player takes control of Hysteron Proteron, a being that was designed by bioengineers to be a strong, intelligent, and loyal super soldier able to take out entire armies. Things didn't go right, however. After a DNA mixup, they instead ended up with a tiny spineless and two-legged creature hardly capable of harming any creature. So rather than having it fighting on the battlefields, it was decided that it should instead be used for insect extermination. The game is a puzzle platformer. Hysteon Proteron has sucker feet that allow it to walk on walls and ceilings but lacks any weapons. Instead, it has to pick up objects that it has to drop onto the insects. If it comes into contact with the insects the player loses one of three lives. Once all insects are dead the player leaves the level and moves on to the next. </p>\n<p><em>Moon Dash</em> takes place in the year 4244 where human colonists have been at war with the alien race known as the Judhs for many years. The player is transporting a PR 64 planet ranger to the capital when numerous alien ships appear above him. The objective of the game is to drive the PR 64 through 16 zones until reaching the city. The game is side-scrolling and the player drives his vehicle on the ground while alien space ships try to crash into him from above. While trying to avoid being hit the player can use his turret to shoot back at the aliens. At the same time, he has to jump over various obstacles on the ground.</p>",

Sigmund has his share of problems and the player has to resolve his mental instability by exploring the surreal world of his inner mind and shut down malfunctioning brain cells. The game plays like any traditional platformer and involves jumping around and shooting at the abstract enemies that roam around. The player can pick up different guns such as a bazooka, a minigun, and others. The game has three levels (referred to as mental zones): ego, psyche, and id. Ego is the easiest and needs to be completed before id is unlocked. Each level is big and requires exploring. The levels are full of items that the player can collect and get points for. The bottom right-hand corner shows a bonus symbol and when collected the symbol will advance until it gets a star. The player will then be transported to a bonus room. The objective of each level is simply to find all eight brain cells and shut them down.</p>",

Gameplay-wise it is quite different from previous releases in the Repton series. Although the focus is still on puzzle-solving the player controls Repton (or Ego as he is called here) from a top-down perspective and the goal of each level is to collect puzzle pieces that have to be assembled into a picture of a famous person, building, painting, etc. The player can only pick up one piece at a time and has to carry it to a frame in the middle of the level where it has to be placed at the right place. It's important to collect the pieces in the right order or else an empty place in the middle might be blocked by surrounding pieces. A piece can only be dropped at the right place and it is not possible to move pieces that have already been placed. The player also has to collect gems that are found all around the levels. The picture can not be completed unless all gems have been collected. Different obstacles exist too. Towers and trees might block the path and there are also holes to fall down into and androids to avoid. There are also transporters and conveyors that are needed to reach certain parts of the levels.</p>",

There are twelve different invaders in the game including one that takes two hits to kill. The invaders have three different kinds of bombs: normal bombs that drop straight down, spinning bombs that drop diagonally, and homing bombs that seek out the player. A notable difference from <em>Space Invaders</em> is that the old shields are gone. Instead, the laser base has a built-in shield that can be activated for protection. The player starts out with two shields and gets new ones at the start of each new wave. The UFOs act as supply ships and will randomly drop power-ups that the player can catch. Power-ups include extra lives and shields, stopping the invaders from moving or dropping bombs, and movable rockets. There's also a power-up that makes the invaders invisible. </p>\n<p>The game also comes with editors that allow the player to change sprites and wave formations.</p>",

There are four different power blocks: four lines, filler, shooter, bomb, and 16-ton weight. Four lines remove up to four incomplete lines from the playfield. Filler replaces the next tetromino with a little alien that the player controls and drops single blocks. It can be used to fill in holes in partially finished lines. The shooter does the opposite and shoots away unwanted blocks. The bomb is used to blow up a section of the playfield. The 16-ton weight removes three columns of blocks when dropped on the playfield.</p>\n<p>The game also features a multiplayer mode where two players compete side-by-side on a split-screen. A special feature in the multiplayer mode is that if one player completes more than one line with a piece the lines are passed to the opponent.</p>",

It contains four different galaxies to explore where the ship needs to stop an alien race from invading. Next to the fighting money needs to be gained by completing missions or through trading. There are four levels of ship types that can be obtained eventually.</p>\n<p>To hyperspace to another galaxy, no equipment is needed. You fly to a special space station (one in each galaxy called JumpStat) and press 'H' to make a hyperspace gate open. Docking is similar; you gain permission by pressing 'D' and if granted you fly into/over the space station.</p>\n<p>The missions roll on one after the other so you don't have to be a specific status to trigger most of them. The radar is located to one side of the main screen as well as in the centre of the main screen, a sort of head-up-display. To pick up cargo, you need no extra equipment. Fly over the yellow cylinders to pick them up and sell them at any station. </p>\n<p>Some space stations have games to play, either a casino or a phase-to-stun game, these can gain you money but equally use up your money.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>RISCWorld Volume 8: Issue 6</em> was the sixth issue of the eighth volume of UK RISCWorld magazine and the last one before the magazine merged with <em>Foundation RISCUser</em> and became Foundation <em>RISCWorld</em>. It contains:* All the latest PD, shareware and freeware releases from the PD column</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ancestor+ (updated release)</li>\n<li>Backup utilities</li>\n<li>Firefox browser (latest release)</li>\n<li>Iyonix software</li>\n<li>Software covered in the letters column</li>\n<li>Support software for the magazine's series on installing software into VirtualRPC</li>\n<li>Two toolbox modules</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most notably it contains the game <em>Starfighter 3000: Next Generation</em>, not available separately. It is a new release of the game for RISC OS, different from the original 1994 <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Starfighter+3000\">Starfighter 3000</a> that was patched over time. This version of the game is a port of the 1996 3DO version by the software group FlaYmz (formerly Visions of the Impossible), headed by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/522441/nathan-atkinson/\">Nathan Atkinson</a>. Originally it was to be included with every Omega PC in 2003, but the deal with Microdigital fell through eventually. Code was sourced from one of the original coders <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Andrew+P.+Hutchings\">Andrew P. Hutchings</a> but the most problematic task was to deal with the many graphical routines which the 3DO used its hardware for. Documentation on the 3DO was difficult to find so the programming effort was massive, being entirely done by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/516896/lee-noar/\">Lee Noar</a>. Other people involved were <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Paul+Thomson\">Paul Thomson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Lee+Johnston\">Lee Johnston</a> and Ramuh who were all involved in the bolt on introduction sequence.</p>\n<p>It uses a different game engine and has enhanced graphics compared to the original version, turning the game world into 3D instead of 2D. There are more colours and special effects such as transparency halo effects around thrusters. Ground textures are now far more detailed. It is fully 32bit compatible and runs on Iyonix, A9, and on VirtualRPC. This version has higher quality audio and cut-scene sequences of cinematic quality animation to introduce each mission. Other enhancements are the sound of large ships at close proximity, the movement of the water, and the ability to level mountains with sustained firing. It is also possible to now play the game from a first-person cockpit view instead of through third-person. In the original game, ship upgrades were bought at the mothership shop through bonuses and cash-convertible points. This version uses ship upgrades through bonuses directly. Unlike the original version of the game, passwords are not supported and all missions of a level need to be completed in one go.</p>",

Marauding aliens are attacking the player's home planet and it's his task to defend it and its civilians. This is done by controlling a spacecraft left and right over the planet's surface while blasting away at the various enemy forces that both try to take down the player and abduct the people standing on the ground.</p>\n<p>If an alien catches a human and drags it to the top of the screen it will mutate and become a dangerous enemy. Humans that fall from a shot-down enemy can be saved by flying into them and then carried back to the surface. If all civilians die the planet will explode but the action will continue in deep space against a swarm of mutated aliens. In addition to the regular fire the player also has access to a limited supply of smart bombs that kill all aliens on the screen. There's also a hyperspace button which allows the player to quickly travel to another part of the stage but using it too much might lead to death.</p>",

The player controls an astronaut that first has to collect all three parts of his rocket and then fully fuel it so that it can take off. The rocket parts are located on various platforms that the astronaut has to use his jetpack to reach. After the rocket has been fully assembled fuel will start falling from the sky and once enough of it has been collected the rocket will automatically ascend.</p>\n<p>The game is entirely played with the mouse, using one button to thrust upwards and the other to shoot at the strange beings flying around. Any contact with these will lead to a lost life and the game ends on the third. There is also a time limit for each level. Points and bonuses are earned by shooting the enemies and collecting falling objects, respectively.</p>",

The player takes control of Bertie Hall, a 26-year-old gambler who has run out of funds for his extravagant lifestyle. The game which is set in 1932 Great Britain takes place on the titular country mansion that is owned by Agatha, Bertie's rich aunt. Bertie and Agatha are not on good terms but despite this Bertie visits the mansion in an attempt to persuade Agatha to part with some of her money. The aim of the game is to impress the aunt so that she changes her will. At the mansion also lives a girl called Veronica who Bertie is in love with and winning over her heart is also part of the player's objectives. </p>\n<p>The game is a traditional text adventure where the player enters verb-noun commands to have Bertie explore the mansion and interact with objects and characters. Tasks have to be carried out and the aunt must be kept happy at all times. Some tasks such as serving dinner have to be carried out on time (each command entered takes one minute of in-game time).</p>",

It is not related to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/8613/rockfall-series/\">Atari ST series</a> with the same name more than being inspired by the same game. Like in the original game the objective is to collect a certain number of gems in each of the game's levels. At the same time, falling boulders have to be avoided since being hit by one leads to a loss of life. There are also some creatures moving around the caves that the player can kill by letting boulders or gems fall on them. Some of them will then be turned into gems. There are also bombs that can be collected and used to kill the creatures. Once enough gems have been collected an exit will open that the player can escape through. This all has to be done before the timer reaches zero.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Legend of the Lost Temple</em> is a platformer that takes place in the rain forest of Peru where an ancient tribe has lived in peace for thousands of years until a group of archaeologists stumbles upon it. The visitors carry a virus that the natives have no immunity to and soon everyone but the young and strong members of the community falls ill. The player takes control of one such young man, Kanu, who sets out to find a temple located deep within a mountain. It is believed that entombed in the temple is an elixir that can save the natives. It is the player's task to find this elixir.</p>\n<p>Like in other platformers the game involves moving left and right and jumping between platforms while combating a large number of different creatures (bees, eagles, green men, etc.) that stand in the player's way. To kill the enemies Kanu has an unlimited supply of axes (similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Wonder+Boy\">Wonder Boy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Adventure+Island\">Adventure Island</a>) that can be thrown. Other weapons can be acquired by picking up green or blue shields. The green shield gives a mace while the blue shield gives a bolt of magic. Other collectibles include gems that give bonus points and various potions that give increased abilities such as higher jumps, temporary invulnerability, increases fire rate, freeze monsters and provide extra lives. When starting out Kanu has four lives and a limited amount of life blood. Life blood is drained when contact with enemies is made and when it is all gone a life is lost.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ballarena</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9001/breakout/\">Breakout</a> variant and as such the player's objective is to clear out all the blocks (which here come in many different shapes) on the screen with the use of a paddle that bounces a ball. What makes it different from other games of its kind is that the paddle is not only moved along the bottom of the screen but in a circle around the blocks located in the middle. There are no borders that stop the ball so it can leave the playing field on any side of the screen. When it has done so four times it is game over for the player. Clearing all blocks from the screen leads to progression to the next stage. Like in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1087/arkanoid/\">Arkanoid</a> it's possible to pick up various power-ups. These include giving bonus points, catching the ball with the paddle, and a laser that can be used to blast blocks. The game also features various monsters that move around the screen and deflect the ball. They can be killed by hitting them with the paddle. </p>\n<p>Every fourth stage is a challenge stage where the game turns into a shoot 'em up similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7720/gyruss/\">Gyruss</a>. Monsters appear in the middle of the screen and the player uses his paddle to shoot them down as quickly as possible. The player then earns points based on the number of shots and hits. </p>\n<p>The game can be played by one or two players simultaneously.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Bubble Fair</em> is a variant of the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/64123/pang/\">Pang</a>. The story involves the characters Inky and Jinky who arrive at a fair as soap bubbles start falling from the sky. The bubbles are the work of the sorcerer ARCphile who wants to control all stalls of the fair. To make him stop, Inky and Jinky challenge him to a duel. The duel involves a game of noughts and crosses where each stall represents a square. In each of the stalls, the player has to catch the ice cream that is hidden within a bubble that blocks access to the stall. For each stall, there are two ice creams to catch and when done that square is won. To win the whole game the player has to win the nought and crosses game four times. </p>\n<p>Like in the arcade game, it is a platform game with single-screen levels. Bubbles will bounce around and the player's task is to destroy them with the use of an upwards traveling rope attached balloon that when hitting a bubble splits it into smaller ones or destroys it completely. The game features power-ups that are dropped when a bubble is hit. These can lead to both positive and negative effects including increased or decreased time or score, giving a shield, extra balloons, or inverting the player's movement. In total there are 72 levels.</p>",

The Hysteron Proteron has no weapons (except for some that can be picked up at certain locations) but can walk on walls and ceilings and pick up certain objects. These objects have to be dropped on the aliens to kill them. Additionally, it's possible to jump and activate devices but only when not carrying an object.

Running one of the programs also launches an application called Banker which keeps track of the player's money. To make bets money is dragged from the banker window to any of the game windows. All games use the same bank account, so any money earned in one account can be spent in another. The game can be played by up to four players. Generous players can choose to give away money to the other players.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Minotaur</em> is a maze game played from a first-person perspective. It is based on the Greek myth where King Minos sent a group of young Athenians to be fed by the Minotaur in the Labyrinth of Crete. The player's task is to enter the labyrinth, save as many men as possible and then escape before getting killed. The player has to reach the men before the minotaur or else they will die. The labyrinth is randomly generated at startup and it's possible for the player to enter its size.</p>\n<p>While moving around the labyrinth the player will come across various items that can be picked up. Most common are the food cans and the bottles which are necessary to avoid thirst or starvation. There are also compasses and pieces of a map that make it easier to find a way through the labyrinth. To be able to kill the minotaur, the player first has to find a sword and will then kill it automatically upon contact. If not in possession of a sword the player can press the spacebar to quickly run away from the minotaur. It will however cause all collected items to disappear.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Cartoon Line: Part One</em> is a side view fixed screen action game set in the old West. The back story involves a character called Snow Face who attempts to kill everyone in town, including the player. The game contains four levels each involving a number of trials where Snow Face is trying to murder the player in various ways. For each trial, there is only one action that can save the player's life and it has to be perfectly timed. In each playthrough, the trials happen in random order. The player can walk left and right across the screen and use three actions: jumping, squatting, and starting a predefined action. When starting out the player has four lives and additional ones are given for each new level or when reaching 10,000 points.</p>",

There are also various hazards to watch out for like falling boulders and collapsing bridges. Daggers are limited in supply but more can be collected throughout the levels. There are also other collectibles that are needed to progress such as keys to open doors.</p>\n<p>The game contains two sets of levels, one easy and one hard, and each is made up of eight levels. The easy levels can be played in any order while in the hard levels a password is required to skip to later levels. In addition to the sixteen levels included in the game, there is also an editor allowing the player to create new levels as well as new scenery or to modify the existing levels.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Hoverbod</em> is an action-puzzle game where the player controls a yellow spherical droid who has to retrieve some stolen treasure from the bad guy Barriuss Stearneruss. The game is played from a side-view perspective and initially, the player is limited to rolling the sphere left and right. However by picking up a collectable the ability to hover in the air is granted. There are two different hover collectibles that decide how high the sphere can move vertically. Another collectable is the missile which allows the sphere to shoot monsters and blast through blocks. Some missile collectables only make it possible to shoot in one direction and a second one has to be collected to be able to shoot both left and right. The monsters are called Ibbles and Squibbles and will kill the sphere on contact. Other dangers include spikes but these can be reversed by picking up the right collectable. Oxygen is limited and a level has to be completed before it runs out although more can be collected.</p>\n<p>The game contains eight levels where the objective is to collect all diamonds. Upon the completion of one, a password is given which allows the player to start on the next one. After all eight levels have been completed the game moves on to a final level called the Castle of Gribb. The objective here is to collect 500 feathers that are needed to build two giant wings used to fly home. In the castle, there is a new enemy type, the Gribbles, who grow and multiply uncontrollably.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mr Doo</em> is a variant of the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9764/mr-do/\">Mr. Do!</a> which makes some changes to the original design. The player controls a wizard who has to collect cherries and avoid various monsters. Unlike the arcade game, the monsters do not chase the player but move in straight lines and only change direction upon reaching a block. The monsters can be killed by throwing a bouncing magic ball or by making apples fall onto them. The magic balls do not recharge in the version but instead, the player starts out with five of them. Other differences include that the apples can not be pushed and that there are no letter monsters. There are some special tiles that add puzzle-solving elements to the game. There are electric cables which kill the player on contact, bombs which detonate when triggered, and sliders which push the wizard across the screen.</p>\n<p>The game can be customized and it is possible to turn off both the special tiles as well as the monsters and apples. There is also an option to play levels in normal, random, or reversed order. In total, the game contains 60 levels and a built-in editor can be used to modify them or to create new ones.</p>",

It has been shattered into six pieces by the evil baron Zaldremon whose forces are now terrorizing the land. The player, who is a wizard, has to recover all the pieces, reassemble the talisman and rid the land of the evil forces.</p>\n<p>The game is similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/361/dizzy-series/\">Dizzy series</a>, with more focus on puzzle-solving and exploration than combat. The enemies that appear can not be fought and have to be avoided since any contact with them will lead to energy being lost. When the energy bar becomes empty one of five lives is lost. The puzzle-solving involves picking up items (two can be carried at a time) and combining them or using them at the right location. Items can be combined logically or by using magic. With the right ingredients, it's possible to cast spells that change the wizard into a mouse or a bird. As a mouse, it is possible to get into small places but not to jump while as a bird one can reach high places but not go through doors or use objects.</p>",

Your opponents are some sort of flying things and round artillery.</p>\n<p>In initial screen you have a choice of a demo, setup keys and play the game itself. Each can be selected either with mouse or keyboard. Setup Keys option shows the default settings and a representation of the keyboard: you use the mouse to click the keys you want, and if you choose the same key twice the program defaults to the standard. Standard setup is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Z - left</li>\n<li>X - right</li>\n<li>' - forwards</li>\n<li>/ - Backwards</li>\n<li>Return - Air fire</li>\n<li>Alt - Ground fire</li>\n<li>Space - Activate FAC - makes your plane invisible for a limited time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Among flying  and shooting enemies you will see some objects with F and H letters. Both are bases, but if you bomb eight F bases you will get one more FAC and the maximum of FACs is 9. H bases are some kind of checkpoints - if you fly over them you will reborn from the last H base, so, do not bomb them.</p>\n<p>Bomb range is marked with crosshair. You can only fire one type of missles at a time. In the right down corner you will see amount of lives, Wave letter (which means level) and number of FACs. The Wave letters increase as you fly, but ther are no break points in between.</p>",

The enemy may try to recapture the bases by sending trucks, so it is highly advised to destroy brigdes, if there are any and to destroy these trucks. of course. The best for bridges are rockets, trucks and barges you may destroy by cannon or rockets. You need to keep an eye on enemy's planes which will try to shoot you down</p>",

You may simply shoot them or place a mine with delayed ignition and for short-distance protection you have up to eight orbitals which circle you and destroy any nearby aliens. From time to time destroyed opponents leave some power-ups to restore your strength, as you have only one life, or to improve your weapons.</p>\n<p>Each level has its own \"boss\" which is a turret with long-distance fire range. The best way to take it down is to sneak as close as possible without detection and then attack. As there is no map or compass you must search for flashing arrows placed on the ground to lead you through all levels.</p>",
