        "description": "<p><em>Space War</em> consists of two shooting games: <em>Horizontal Intercept</em> and <em>Vertical Intercept</em>.</p>\n<p>In <em>Horizontal Intercept</em> the player has to destroy enemy spaceships with the use of rockets. The spaceships pass by horizontally and the player launches his rockets from the bottom of the screen. Once the rocket is in the air he can steer it left or right. The player has 20 rockets and the goal is simply to score as many points as possible. Some spaceships move faster and will therefore give more points, and there are both big and small spaceships, the latter being worth more points.</p>\n<p><em>Vertical Intercept</em> is a one-button game for two players. Each player controls a missile launcher on each side of the screen and in between them an enemy spaceship moves up and down. The player's missile climbs when the player holds down the button and drops when he releases it. The game ends when the spaceship hits a marker at the top of the screen 8 times. Hitting the spaceship makes it reverse its direction, so the game can be prolonged.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The RCA Studio II came with 5 built-in games and programs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Doodle:</em> A simple program that allows the user to draw (doodle) on the screen. With the RCA Studio II being monochrome, the player can only draw white pixels on the screen. There is a cursor and the user can move it in 8 different directions, deciding whether it should paint or erase pixels on the screen.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Patterns:</em> Another drawing program, this time enabling the user to create a doodle that can be infinitely repeated on screen by the system, inverting all the pixels it comes across in the process and generating unexpected patterns. If the user launches the program after drawing with Doodle first, the patterns are drawn on top of the original doodle.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Bowling:</em> A simplistic top-down rendition of bowling for (exactly) two players. The ball moves automatically up and down the lane and the players just need to choose when to throw it. There are 3 different throws: straight, hook down, and hook up. After 10 frames are played, the final scores are shown and the game ends.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Freeway:</em> A racing game where the player drives a car in a straight freeway and must steer to avoid collisions with other cars. Accidents will only slow the player down, but this has a great impact on the score as the goal is to make the best mileage within 2 minutes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Addition:</em> A math educational game for one or two players. The goal is to simply add 3 digits that show up on the screen simultaneously and press the according button on the keyboard. In a two player game, the player that hits the correct button first wins the round. The game ends after 20 rounds.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p><em>TV Arcade II: Fun with Numbers</em> is a cartridge containing three games:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Guess the Number (1 Player):</em> The game randomly determines a three digit number that the player has to guess. It has to be done in twenty turns or less and for each guess the game gives a clue in the form of a number 000 to 006. 000 means no digits are right and 006 that the guess is right. 001 means one digit is right but in the wrong position and 002 means one position is right or that two digits are right but in the wrong position. 003-006 is for any feasible combination of the previous two.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Guess the Number (2 Players):</em> Same as above but with two human players who start with entering their own numbers. They then take turns making guesses until one player correctly guesses the opponent's number.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Reverse (1 Player):</em> The player is presented with a randomly scrambled sequence of the numbers 1 to 9 and has to rearrange the numbers so that the numeral sequence is created. This is done by reversing a selected group of numbers. For example pressing the 2 key reverses the first two numbers while the 9 key reverses the whole sequence. The player has 30 moves to complete the puzzle.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p><em>TV Arcade IV: Baseball</em> is an adaptation of the sport for two players. When one player is batting the other pitches and controls the movement of the fielders. A game starts with the pitcher pressing one of three keys: 5 for a straight pitch, 2 for an inside curve and 8 for an outside curve. Holding any of the keys down leads to a change up. The batter then has to swing the bat by pressing the 5 key. After a hit the defending player can move the fielders up and down to attempt to catch the ball. Movement of runners is automatic. The player with the highest score after nine innings wins the game. If it is a tie, up to 99 extra innings can be played or until a player gets 99 runs.</p>",

There are five types of problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and a combination) and four difficulty levels. The first three levels are arithmetic problems while the fourth level involves elementary algebra.</p>",

It can be played by two human players or against an AI opponent. Both players can move their gun men up and down and shoot at the enemy. A cactus in the middle of the screen offers some protection. Holding down the fire button leads to two bullets being fired but at a slower speed. The game lasts two minutes and the player with the most hits wins. </p>\n<p><em>Moonship Battle</em> is also a one-on-one shooting game but takes place in space and is for two players only. Unlike Gunfighter the players can move around and shoot both horizontally, vertically and at angles. The aim is to destroy the opponent's moonship by firing rockets. Each player has an energy level which starts at 100 and decreases when moving around, firing rockets, receiving hits and colliding. Once a ship has all of its energy depleted the opponent wins the game.</p>",
