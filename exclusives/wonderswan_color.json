        "description": "<p>There are six nations living in the world of floating islands. The most powerful one is the Ordia Empire, possessing the best aircrafts in the world. But its leaders were hungry for even more power, and planned to invade and to occupy the other five nations. The other nations tried to maintain diplomatic relationship with the Empire as long as possible. But one of those countries, the Esk Republic, decided to send a special strike team of skillful pilots, attempting to initiate a secret rebellion against the Empire. A young pilot named Keid, guided by his senior partner, the girl Payer, is the one who was chosen for this mission.</p>\n<p><em>Blue Wing Blitz</em> is a turn-based strategy RPG with a twist: instead of fighters or soldier units, you command aircrafts. You navigate your planes over a battle field, which consists of airspaces, in round-based fashion. Once you land on a space occupied by an enemy plane, a battle follows. During those battles you have control over your aircraft, performing various attacks or defending. After several turns, the battle stops, but will resume if the enemy planes are still standing on the same space.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Digimon Medley</em> is based on the popular manga and and anim\u00e9 series <em>Digimon</em>, in which ordinary Japanese children find a way into a digital world, where they help good digital monsters fight against evil ones. The game is not directly plot-related to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/109201/digimon-adventure/\"> Digimon Adventure</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/21236/digimon-tamers-brave-tamer/\">Digimon Tamers: Brave Tamer</a> games. Instead, it follows more closely the actual episodes of the series. You play as various characters, such as the main hero Taichi and his friend Yamato from the first episodes, as well as heroes from the <em>Digimon Tamers</em> sub-series: Takato, Ruki, and Lee. The game is divided into short episodes, each one of which revives one of the battles in the series. You start with Digimon Tamers, as they venture into the DigiWorld, only to meet the enigmatic digimon named Impmon, who is up to some mischief. </p>\n<p>Each episode can be played as one of several available characters. Each character also has his/her own digimon who fights all the battles. The battles are random and occur while you are navigating your heroes through top-down dungeons. The attacks are displayed as short anim\u00e9-style sequences. During your turn, you must press the A button repeatedly to increase the power of your attack. The enemy attacks simultaneously, and you have to invest enough power in your attack in order for it to connect.</p>",

Led by their evil god, the machines were eventually able to win the battle and to take control over the world. You play the role of Elc, the hero of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Arc+the+Lad+2\"> Arc the Lad 2</a>. As always, Elc is a freelance mercenary who gets assignments from his guild. He encounters Finia, a girl who belonged to a resistance group and whose mother was killed by the machines. With the help of other friends, the heroes must save the humanity and restore the world to normal.</p>\n<p>This is a side-story in Arc the Lad series, set in a futuristic environment. As in the classic Arc the Lad games, the entire dungeon navigation is perceived as a series of continuous battles. You move your heroes in turn-based mode, and enemies use their turn to perform their moves. You can attack once an enemy is on a square near you, and also use a variety of special techniques.</p>",

You play a nameless character with no background and there is no plot information or development beside your own progress with the quests. The gameplay consists entirely of playing cards. In the beginning of the game, an enigmatic woman named Maria asks you a series of questions, to determine the cards you get. After that, your character begins an adventure in a town. Locations, other characters, inventory, your movement - everything appears in form of cards. To get quests, you must choose your correspondent cards when encountering different people. You can buy weapons and equipment, and also fight enemies in turn-based combat by choosing the cards from your deck. You gain levels and become stronger in a traditional RPG fashion.</p>",

You can take in to a stroll in the forest, go shopping with it, make it play with a ball, and so on. You can also perform actions unrelated to the hamster, like re-decorating the house or writing and painting on a piece of paper.

Two young girls, Marlone and Elvira, have to study at the Academy of Alchemy, make powerful items, and prove to their masters they are worthy to be real alchemists.</p>\n<p><em>Futari no Atelier</em> is a Japanese-style role-playing game with light simulation elements. The heroines have to read books and talk to people in order to learn more about items, and then buy these items or find them somewhere. They must then combine powerful items in order to impress their teachers. The player also develops the characters in a standard RPG fashion. They can equip weapons and armor, and fight random enemies in wilderness areas. The characters gain levels and become stronger the more enemies they fight. The battles are automatic, and it is only possible to assign a general strategy to the characters.</p>",

The characters of the game participate in a tournament, the winner of which would face a gear who went out of control and is threatening to lead a gear rebellion against the humans. The game allows you to play as familiar characters from Guilty Gear series, such as the main hero Sol Badguy, who has a certain connection to the gears, and his rival, the leader of the Holy Knights named Ky Kiske. It also introduces a new character, the nurse Fanny, who fights with a syringe and has a mysterious connection to the genius surgeon, and later serial murderer, Dr. Baldhead. </p>\n<p><em>Guilty Gear Petit</em> is a 2D fighting game. The story mode lets you pick a character and take him/her through a series of fights, while in time attack mode you can choose your opponents freely. The graphics are done in \"super-deformed\" style. The game retains key ingredients of Guilty Gear gameplay, such as building tension in order to execute powerful attacks, combo moves, etc.</p>",

These gears were very powerful, but did not have wills of their own, and were completely obedient to the humans. However, a gear named Justice was able to free himself from the control and led a rebellion against the humans. Since then, the humanity lived in fear that the gears will one day gain the power on the Earth. For that purpose, the Sacred Order of the Holy Knights organized fighting tournaments to find out who is strong enough to face the renegade gears.</p>\n<p>\"Guilty Gear Petit 2\" is very similar to its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/21559/guilty-gear-petit/\"> predecessor</a>, having the same \"super-deformed\" graphical style, battle moves (including the tension system to accumulate power and combo attacks), as well as backgrounds for battles. Several new characters appear in \"Guilty Gear Petit 2\", such as Zato-1, the former head of the assassin guild, the pirate captain Johnny, the time traveler Axl Lou from the 20th century, the mysterious Faust, and others.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Wonder Classic</em> is a golfing game where you will use different characters with specific abilities to your advantage. For example the character, Reiko Nagase nullifies the effects of wind, most others have certain benefits to certain types of shot. There are two starting characters and twenty-two unlockable and downloadable characters.</p>\n<p>The game consists of the following modes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Training: play whatever field you like as long as you like.</li>\n<li>Character Get: you'll challenge your way through ten golfers, after you beat them you'll be able to play as them elsewhere in the game.</li>\n<li>Stroke: play against the score.</li>\n<li>Match: play by hole, each time golfer gets a hole he will go \"1UP\" while his opponent will go \"1DOWN\". Whoever is \"UP\" in the end wins. If the \"DOWN\" player cannot win given the number of remaining holes then the game will end.</li>\n<li>Mini Battle: Driving Contest: a match contest where the golfers will only drive.</li>\n<li>Mini Battle: Near-Pin: a match contest that will involve only shots near the pin.</li>\n<li>Mini Course: you play on a 3-par 9 hole course, you may play against a computer if you so wish.</li>\n<li>Tour: 32 contestants enter the tour, who will win? You'll have to hone your <em>Wonder Classic</em> golfing skills to best this. Winning in tour mode will unlock new courses.</li>\n<li>Net Tour: this mode will allow you the download the best 32 Tour scores that have been uploaded via the WonderGate. And then play a tour against those people, not the real people but against their scores, in a tour. You can also upload you own scores to compare them online.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The gameplay of <em>Wonder Classic</em> includes the ability to use the Y-buttons to augment just how your club will come in contact with the ball, to subtlety alter its trajectory. You'll also have six \"Power Shots\" which will have to be carefully conserved in each match.</p>\n<p>Using the WonderGate you could get new clubs as well as stat altering equipment, such as gloves. You also could get new characters and courses through the WonderGate as well. This feature also allowed you to see your score as part of a \"global\" ranking.</p>",

Various button combos will avoid certain obstacles, although a \"one-button\" easy mode is available. When you avoid an obstacle a note will sound, clearing long chains of obstacles will result in funky melodies popping up inside the song that is playing.

This dungeon has a heavenly aura.\n* Shootingstar - A fiery land that will start to test your knowledge of the controls from Lindwurm.\n* Jabberwock - A whimsical land that is bathed in night. When the night shall end is unknown.\n* Quetzalcoatl - The area named for the Aztec sky god and creator. The entire map can no longer be seen.\n* J\u00f6rmungandr - The serpent that shall kill Thor. This stage is a mythic earthy setting.</p>\n<p>The A button swings your sword and the B rings up your shield, the key items of any knight. Slashing your foes with your sword and devouring projectiles with your shield will increase your special meter, which when filled will allow you to perform a deadly special attack \u201cShining Sword\u201d or \"Blazing Sword\".</p>\n<p>One interesting features of <em>Dicing Knight.</em> is the \u201cdicing\u201d every time you attack an enemy dice will pop out of it and roll, you\u2019ll deal damage to the foe based on the rolls you get. Likewise when you are hit dice also roll to determine you\u2019re damaged. </p>\n<p>The Y buttons will be mapped to four different items, which can be found inside your foes. A variety of items are included in the game such as an item that will predict or alter dice rolls, a variety of stat altering potions, invincibility items, and a drill that will let you progress through dungeon wall to avoid monster filled rooms. Various orbs are also obtainable, via a lottery system, which will improve your abilities. </p>\n<p>After you beat the game on \u201cKnight Mode\u201d you\u2019ll obtain a, \u201cFortuner Mode\u201d, which will alter the game play, keeping the dungeon crawling style but giving you the ability to shoot to you and more of the monsters. The A button will be transformed into a double pistol, and the B will lob grenades. As well as two new specials that allow you to absorb enemy bullets or do a powerful shock attack. A new stage with a fitting title will also appear:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ouroboros - The snake eating its own tail, an alchemical symbol of immortality, this dungeon rests betwixt time, eternal, and waiting.</li>\n</ul>",

Starting from a small space station above the earth your lone fighter will travail the bullet filled cosmos, always a shot away from death, to achieve this goal.</p>\n<p><em>Judgement Silversword</em> is a vertically scrolling shooter in which wave upon wave of multifarious of opposing craft will try to take you down with bullets, bombs, lasers, or even their own fuselages. Using the Y-Buttons as a directional pad and the X-Buttons for your weaponry you'll try your hand at completing the S-AIXAKs destiny.</p>\n<p>You'll have three weapons at your disposal, spread cannon, concentrated cannon, and your energy shield. The spread cannon will fire an arch of bullet out before you, while a concentrated will fire only directly before you. Your energy shield can be used to absorb incoming shot, however, your back and sides will remain vulnerable. The shield can also be used to damage enemies by ramming them with it. As you use it the shield will run out of energy and need to be recharged. </p>\n<p>The game has thirty different areas each comprised of about ten sub areas. Scores are awarded based on kill ratio and completion time. New modes and easter eggs will be unlocked as you obtain higher scores.</p>",

Pieces made up of four blocks (dubbed \"tetriminoes\") fall into a 10x20 square well, and must be arranged into complete lines, which then vanish and clear more space on the board. As lines are cleared, the game speed increases until either the tetriminoes reach the top of the well or the player completes the goal for the current mode.</p>\n<p>This version features three single-player modes: Marathon mode, which continues until the player loses; 40lines mode, which is a race to complete 40 lines; and 3min mode, where the goal is to earn as many points as possible within a 3-minute time limit. There is also a 2-player versus mode which uses the WonderSwan's link cable, much like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=045496730277\">the Game Boy version</a>.</p>",

Here you will take the role of an anonymous guy -created specially for this game- named \"The Mask\" (although you can change his name for one of your choice) and will have to defeat all the characters of the Kinnikuman universe that appear in your way.</p>\n<p>You will move thorough the world by means of menus and world maps which ask you what you want to do next (that is, you don't see a miniature of your character moving around the locations, just pictures and text), until you find someone to fight with. During fights you see static images of the two fighters, and after every hit you will see how many energy units both personages have lost. The list of actions you can execute during a fight range from \"hit\", \"throwing\", \"guard\" to all the special movements (which will show a full screen image of the attack executed). Once you finish a fight (which you won), you will see how much your fighting skills have grown. There's a total of 63 fighters in the game.</p>",

The protagonist is selectable by the player at the beginning of the game, either the boy or the girl depicted on the front cover, together with some input such as the name, date of birth, and a blood type. The story starts with the player character about to become the new village chief. The ceremony gets interrupted by a bunch of attacking monsters and the hero barely escapes with their life. </p>\n<p>The game uses a 3/4 view where the player moves in a vertical and horizontal way, can interact with other NPCs and fight enemies on the screen using projectiles or blunt weapons. Fighting is done in real-time, and after battling many weaker enemies, one will usually face a boss. While the player starts the game alone, they will get a pet companion, choosable out of four different types, in the middle of the journey. Leveling up is not done through gaining experience from combat, but instead by finding fairies scattered around the land.</p>",

The protagonist in this mystery story is none other than Holmes, the cat, not Sherlock, who got involved in a murder incident in an old castle somewhere in southern part of Germany, which is nowadays used as a sightseeing hotel. Ancient legends about witches, demons and strange phenomena are well known in the area, which adds a touch of supernatural to be feared of, if any of it true.</p>\n<p>This game is made to play as a sound comic, meaning the artwork is made as an interactive comic book which progresses the story, yet allowing the player to enter choices which will take the story in a different direction and lead to one of several different endings.</p>",
