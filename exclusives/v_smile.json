Po the Panda is a waiter in his dad's noodle restaurant but he secretly dreams of becoming a kung fu fighter. By accident he gets selected as the next 'Dragon Warrior', and he will have to train hard to be able to defend the residents of the Valley of Peace. </p>\n<p>Through a number of mini-games, this game teaches numbers, puzzles, letters, logic, shapes and categorization. It is aimed at 4- to 6-year-olds. Examples of the mini-games are: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Building bridges using a number of oddly shaped blocks, players have to choose the block that fits to complete the bridge.</li>\n<li>Saving villagers by lowering ropes of the correct length. Players have to solve a math question that deals with the concepts of \"more\" and \"less\" to continue.</li>\n<li>Making dried up rivers flow again by removing rocks. This requires solving logic riddles.</li>\n<li>Delevering foods to shops. The player has to recognize the correct shop to deliver to from the sign-board. On a more difficult setting, letters are used.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options in the game include writing \"Chinese\" characters, and \"Kung Fu Training\" in which Po catches food with chop sticks.</p>",

You take the role of Superman to stop a group of criminals who have put the city of Metropolis under siege. Whilst playing, you help deal with various threats to the people of Metropolis such as fires and the criminal's cyborg spiders. As this is aimed towards children with strong educational elements, there is no violence in the game. The main game mode is called Learning Adventure and contains four adventures with different mini-games:* Fire Rescue (Hand-Eye coordination/science)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Air Hunt (Hand-Eye coordination/spelling)</li>\n<li>Robot Rampage (object matching/map reading)</li>\n<li>Stolen Artwork (Hand-Eye coordination/problem solving)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>They can be played in the correct order in the Adventure Play mode, or any part right away in Quick Play. The second main mode is called Learning Zone. It contains four games that focus on four specific skills. They are:* Runaway Train (Mathematics)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Missing Persons (Comprehension)</li>\n<li>Road Repair (Problem Solving)</li>\n<li>Reporter Wrap-Up (Memory Skills)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unlike the first mode, there are less game elements and practicing the educational skill comes first to help out Superman.</p>\n<p>It is possible to continue playing from the last session if the cartridge has not been removed from the unit and if there was no interruption in power supply. The game is compatible with the V.Smile, V.Smile Pocket, V.Smile PC Pal, V.Smile Cyber Pocket and V.Motion gaming systems from any country.</p>",

When the mini-game is finished, the clue will appear, and will be written down in the Handy Dandy Notebook. The mini-games teach skills such as matching shapes, putting items into different categories, and sorting objects by first letter.</p>\n<p>There are also two sub-modes: Quick Play and Learning Zone. Quick Play is shorter than a full Blue's Clues game, and is mostly learning mini-games. Learning Zone is mostly learning mini-games, but is not nearly as short as Quick Play.

The next level is a platforming stage where you must pop the bubbles with the correct numbers. Enemies do hurt you, so you must be careful on your journey.

As the Backyardigans go on a voyage to find unclaimed land, you are along to help them. In the jungle level, you can use the actions buttons to help Pablo run, jump, and find fruit for their adventure. There are occasionally roadblocks on Pablo's path, where you need to tell him how to fix it. After the jungle level, you must catch big fish and small fish with Uniqua and Pablo. Once you get into the ocean with your ship, you must row the ship to keep it moving while avoiding rocks and collecting pieces of the map. Once you finish collecting the map, you must put Tasha to sleep so she gets out of your way and finally make it to the unclaimed land. The game also has difficulty levels for younger and older children.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Cranium Partyland Park</em>, based off the Cranium board game, features seven total activities and a sing-along. Two of them each involve Data Head, Star Performer, and Word Worm; one features Creative Cat. Along with a single player option called Fun for One, Play with Friends allows two to four players to play at the same time. Like other V.Smile games, easy and difficult are the two difficulty levels included.</p>\n<p>\"Data Head's Mega Match-Ups\" involves \"Space Race\" and \"Zooper Zoo.\" In \"Space Race,\" the player plays as Data Head, who must obtain certain items in space with his spaceship (easy) and may have to guess,based on the pattern, the next item to pick up (difficult). \"Zooper Zoo\" involves choosing which animal made a certain sound (easy mode) or belongs in a different habitat than shown (difficult mode). \"Star Performer's Stage\" consists of \"Monster Music Machine\" and \"Let's Dance Dance Dance.\" \"Monster Music Machine\" has the player, as Star Performer, perform certain instruments at the right time in a pace that quickens through time; the difficulty corresponds with the complexity of the series of actions. For \"Let's Dance Dance Dance,\" the player, once again as Star Performer, repeats three to four button moves that the game asks (easy) or four to five joystick/button moves. \"Word Worm's Alphabet World\" has \"Letter Lounge\" and \"Lake Wordy Word.\" In \"Letter Lounge,\" the player selects an item that starts with a certain letter in one (easy) or more than one (difficult) section of a house. \"Lake Wordy Word\" has the player make three to four-letter (easy) or four to five-letter (difficult) words by fishing for letters. \"Creative Cat's Art Studio\" only consists of \"Mondo Matcher,\" where the player stops certain sections of a slot spinner to form a complete illustration of a certain animal.</p>\n<p>In \"Sing Along,\" the player can use the microphone attached to the V.Smile console to play vocal performances to five songs, which are \"Baa, Baa, Black Sheep,\" \"Old MacDonald Had a Farm,\" \"Pop! Goes the Weasel,\" \"This Old Man,\" and \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.\" Star Performer will dance during the songs. The player can also change certain lyrics of each song for humorous purposes.</p>",

Wubbzy!</em> involves the player, or Wubbzy, handling a pet fleegle. When initially in the main menu, the player can choose between \"Learning Adventure,\" \"Learning Zone,\" \"Sing Along,\" and \"Options.\"</p>\n<p>Selecting \"Learning Adventure\" takes the player to its menu, which has three choices including \"Adventure Play,\" \"Quick Play,\" and \"Settings.\" The main game, \"Adventure Play,\" features Wubbzy purchasing a fleegle; he neglects and throws out the care manual on the way home, then falls asleep, unaware that the fleegle grows when eating sweets. Can Wubbzy shrink it back to its original size? In all, there are three regular stages and one final minigame to play in total. In \"Quick Play,\" the player can choose one of the four stages from the main game. In \"Settings,\" the player can select \"Easy\" or \"Difficult,\" which affects the main game's gameplay.</p>\n<p>Upon choosing \"Learning Zone,\" the player can play one of three games, with an option to use Vtech's V.Smile PC Pal: \"Wubbzy's Magic Tricks,\" \"Dancing Doodles,\" and \"Hide-and-Seekity-Seek.\" The first game has the player finish the color combination or type the word shown in order for Wubbzy to pull out from his hat an animal. The second has the player draw with a pen or joystick the path shown in order to have Wubbzy learn dance moves. The third has the player spot certain animals in a landscape by using a mouse or joystick. In \"Settings,\" the player can once again select \"Easy\" or \"Difficult,\" which affects the the secction's gameplay.</p>\n<p>In \"Sing Along,\" the player can do karaoke with the TV show's season two theme song, along with \"Wubbzy Wiggle.\" He/she has the option to include the voiceovers played in the music; with voiceovers, the theme song would sound like the exact version of its show counterpart, and \"Wubbzy Wiggle\" would include Wubbzy's singing. The volume of the music itself can also be altered. The microphone for the console can be used for both of those songs.</p>\n<p>When \"Options\" is chosen, the player can choose to have music on or off; he/she can do the same with the tutorial selection.</p>",

When turning on the game and going to the main menu, the player can choose between \"Learning Adventure,\" \"Learning Zone,\" and \"Options.\"</p>\n<p>\"Learning Adventure\" is the main game. Zayzoo, a Planet Z inhabitant, went on an interplanetary field trip to Earth. When he became curious about a cat and tried to go after it, he got lost and his own classmates left Earth before he could board the spaceship back. Two human children came across Zayzoo and invited him to their school, where he could gain extensive knowledge about their lifestyles. Meanwhile, will Zayzoo find his way back to his planet? The player controls Zayzoo throughout the four levels in this main game. When selecting \"Learning Adventure,\" the player has a choice between \"Adventure Play,\" which takes the player through all four levels with the story, or \"Quick Play,\" which allows the player to select one of the levels to play. He/she can also choose one of three difficulties: \"easy,\" \"medium,\" or \"hard.\"</p>\n<p>In \"Learning Zone,\" the player can choose between three activities: \"Block Out,\" \"Wordswap,\" and \"Music Time.\" For that section, he/she can also choose one of the same three difficulties mentioned in \"Learning Adventure.\" In \"Block Out,\" the player, Zayzoo, must play in a similar manner of \"Break Out\" by trying to hit certain books that contain the correct letters that spell words corresponding to the chalkboard drawing; words get longer as difficulty rises, and the player must identify unused letters in the word given during medium and hard. \"Wordswap\" has the player, once again Zayzoo, try to recognize certain words in a sentence in easy mode; During medium and hard modes, he/she must unscramble certain sentences to make them flow correctly. Lastly, \"Music Time\" is a rhythm game in which the player, who controls four human classmates must press the correct colored buttons that correspond with the instruments that the notes go to; the notes scroll faster with higher difficulty. Song choices for this minigame include \"Can Can,\" \"Oh Susana,\" \"Polly Wolly Doodle,\" \"Puff the Magic Dragon,\" and \"Yankee Doodle.\"</p>\n<p>Upon choosing \"Options,\" the player can decide on whether or not the game's music should play.</p>",
