You start the game with three hearts, which you can replenish by collecting additional hearts throughout the stage. There are four different weapons you can use to aid you on your quest: the trident, your default weapon; the bubble, which can fire rapidly; the shell, which fires in three directions at once; and the magic, which can be charged up to release a powerful blast. Throughout each stage you can also find a shield that make you temporarily invincible, and a starfish which provides you with extra points.</p>",

The game plays the same as most Puyo Puyo variants. Sets of two blobs fall from the top, and each blob can be one of five types. You need to match at least four of the same blobs in order to clear them and increase your score. You can see the next two upcoming sets of blobs on the side of the play field. The left, right, and down buttons on the directional pad are used to move the sets of blobs, and the two face buttons are used to rotate them clockwise and counterclockwise. The more points you score, the faster the sets of blobs fall. Once all the blobs pile up to the top of the screen, you lose the game.</p>",

In the game you have to match three or more of the same gem in a row to score points and clear the gems, allowing for more gems to fall in from the top. Matching gems also replenishes your timer, which will cause you to get a game over if it runs out. To match gems, you need to use the directional pad to move the cursor to the gem you want, then press the right face button to select it. Then you select the adjacent gem you want to switch places with using the directional pad. There are three difficulty modes which effect how many unique gems there are for you to match: six different gems in easy mode, seven in normal mode, and eight in hard mode.</p>",

There are various temporary power-ups that you can collect to aid you including: the turnfish, which turns all enemies on screen into starfish; the shootfish, which allows you to shoot at enemies using bubbles; the lifefish, which gives you an extra life; and the magnetfish, which attracts all nearby starfish towards you. There are three types of enemies in the game, a fish, a jellyfish, and a eel. If you are touched by one of these enemies and you don't have an extra life then you get a game over. You control your fish using the up and down buttons on the directional pad, and the right face button is also used for certain power-ups.</p>",

In the game you are placed into a small level and must find two survivors before the level exit opens up and you can move on to the next level. To do this you have to fight off all the zombies that get in your way. These zombies can drop coins, which give you points, and hearts, which replenish your health. Once you have found the two survivors and the exit opens, a timer starts counting down. If this timer reaches zero before you exit the level, your health starts to slowly drain. If you exit the level before the timer reaches zero, the remaining time is added to your score. There are 64 levels total.</p>\n<p>The player character's movement is controlled with the directional pad, and you can shoot your gun with both of the action buttons. Holding down the action button will allow you to shoot at a faster rate, however if you hold it down for too long your gun will jam and you have to wait a few seconds before you can shoot again. Shooting by holding down the right action button will allow you to strafe using the directional pad.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Fantasy Rampage</em> is a very simple card game that can be played against the computer or with another player. The game is split into two game modes, \"Basic\" and \"Advanced\". In the basic mode, each player is four cards out of a 48 card deck. Both players draw a fifth card at the beginning of each turn. The first player plays one of their cards, followed by the second player, and the winner of the round is the player who plays the card with the highest value. The player who wins is the one who goes first during the next round. The game ends once all cards have been played, with the player with the most wins is crowned the victor.</p>\n<p>The advanced mode plays mostly the same but with a number of additional elements. Each card has one of four elements: air, earth, fire, and water. At the beginning of each round a element is picked at random and all cards with that element get a plus one bonus in value. Certain cards also have bonus abilities which reduce the value of cards which have a different element then its own.</p>",

To do this you must sneak past the patrolling wardens, collect the food hidden in the level, and feed that food to its corresponding animal. There are a total of three animals to feed, a elephant, a lion, and a zebra. Once you have fed all the animals you can leave the zoo and end the game. Getting caught by the wardens will either take you back to the point at which you entered the screen you are currently on when your on normal difficulty, or give you a game over if you are playing on hard difficulty.</p>",

You create these matches by picking up the blocks at the bottom and placing them elsewhere. There are three different types of blocks and you can carry three of the same kind of block at once.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Diatoms:</strong> in this game you have a central vertical row of piece you can control and pieces falling in from the left and right sides. You can move the central row of pieces up and down. You can also move pieces horizontally, allowing you to move pieces that have falling in from the sides in the vertical row. Once the screen is filled up with pieces you get a game over, so you must create matches of three or more pieces with the vertical row to remove them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pop Drop:</strong> in this game, pieces gradually fall in from the top, so you must move the pieces around to create matches of three or more in order to stop them filling up the screen. You do this by selecting a piece then pressing the direction you would like to move it to.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

The world is split into four regions, each of which contain a boss which must be defeat in order to proceed to the next region. The gameplay is fairly straight forward, you walk around the world, running into random encounters and finding chests which can contain useful goodies. You can heal you character completely for free at an inn and purchase consumables at a shop. Battles are turn-based, each turn you are given the choice to attack with your currently equipped weapon (or your fists if you don't have a weapon yet), cast a spell, use an item, or try to run away. Winning a battle will reward you with experience and some gold.</p>",
