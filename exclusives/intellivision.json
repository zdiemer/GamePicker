        "description": "<p><em>B-17 Bomber</em> takes place near the end of World War II. As the pilot of a B-17, your mission is to fly across the English Channel and bomb various strategic targets. First you need to select a destination which features a lot of targets. The further the target is from your home base, the more points you can earn, but with more ground to cover there will be more enemy fighters blocking the target and more fuel will be needed. Once a destination is set, you need to stock your plane with bombs and fuel, then take off! You will now have a first person point of view from the plane and can control which of several views is active. When trying to bomb targets, you will be looking straight down from the bombay doors. When you hear a voice announce incoming enemy planes, you need to switch the view to one of the guns and defend yourself. Lastly you can have a view from the cockpit to control the plane. If your fuel runs low, or your plane takes too much damage, you can fly back to your home base for repairs and then take off again to bomb as many targets as you can!</p>",

Your crop of corn is displayed on the left side of the screen, and you need to protect it from the incoming hoard of inchworms, moths, caterpillars, slugs, and other assorted bugs which approach rapidly from the right. If any of the bugs sneak past you, they will eat part of your corn crop. The game ends when all of the corn has been eaten. On each level you need to spray all of the bugs that appear in order to move on to the next round; as the rounds progress, the bugs become faster, more numerous, and home in quicker on the corn.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Happy Trails</em> is an action strategy game for one or two players. Black Bart has robbed the stagecoach, and you need to recover all of the stolen money within the given time limit! The money is located in various locations in a series of maze-like paths. The paths are broken up into tiles, and there is one tile missing so you can rearrange the maze by moving a tile into the empty space. As your character walks through the paths, you need to rearrange the tiles to make sure there is always a connected path in front of him (or you'll lose a life) and to guide him towards the money bags. When all of the money has been recovered, you move on to the next round. On the more difficult rounds, Black Bart will also be wandering around the maze trying to stop you! You should avoid him at all costs, unless you have first collected a star which gives your character temporary invincibility.</p>",

The games are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Crosswords:</strong>\n This game is similar to Scrabble. Each player is given seven letters from which they need to form words on the game board. On each turn the player can create words either horizontally or vertically, and must use one (or more) of the existing letters on the board. Points are earned depending on the word created, and at the end of 20 turns the player with the most points wins!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Letter Hunt:</strong>\n In this game each player controls a monkey in a letter forest. Each monkey must collect letters from the forest to spell three words within the given time limit. When both monkeys are complete, points are awarded for the words spelled and the highest score wins!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Word Rockets:</strong>\n In this game the players control a rocket capable of collecting and shooting vowels upwards. On the top of the screen, various words which are missing vowels will float by and each player needs to try to fire an appropriate vowel into the empty space. The first player who can complete 50 words wins!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

You begin at the bottom of the screen, and need to climb your way to the top while avoiding the many obstacles. Boulders, birds, bats, and rats will all get in the way and cause you to lose a life if collided with. To move from floor to floor, you need to find a window that is open and climb up. The windows change quickly, so when you spot one climb fast! When you finally reach the top, Horrible Hank will fall off the building and then the game begins again at a more difficult skill level.</p>",

Unfortunately, their vacation is interrupted when Doris is kidnapped by the bully Beach Bruiser. Now Clarence needs to rescue Doris by chasing the Beach Bruiser all over the island! The Beach Bruiser will be carrying Doris to the right and the screen scrolls to follow. You need guide Clarence and catch up to Doris. There are many obstacles on the screen which temporarily slow down your progress. Coconuts, ferns, clams, sand snakes, and lava will all appear in your way. If you get slowed down too much and hit the left side of the screen, you lose one of your lives. From time to time, Doris will drop a handkerchief; collect this and you become temporarily invincible! If you catch Doris, you then move on to the next section of the island; when each section of the island has been completed you then need to battle the Beach Bruiser on a bridge. If you're successful, the game will then repeat at a more difficult skill level.</p>",

As the gorilla walks on, it will encounter a creature which has a math problem with it. You need to enter in the correct answer to the problem as quickly as possible. If you get the answer correct, your gorilla may continue on. If you get the answer wrong, then your gorilla must jump into the river. Your gorilla is unable to leave the river and continue on until you answer another math problem correctly. The goal is to correctly answer as many of the problems as you can in the shortest amount of time. The game includes eighteen different levels of difficulty which can be set individually for each player.</p>",

The Wind Raider has a limited amount of fuel to reach the intended destination. Additionally, numerous fireballs will be flying around the screen trying to stop the Wind Raider, with Skeletor running along on the ground. The Wind Raider is equipped with bombs and guns which can be used to defend He-Man from the fireballs, while also earning bonus points if Skeletor is hit. </p>\n<p>The second part of the game takes place on foot. When the He-Man lands near the castle, he needs to pursue Skeletor. Skeletor will be firing numerous lightning bolts which can be blocked with a shield. There is a time limit here and the He-Man must get past all of the screens and catch Skeletor before time runs out. If the player is successful, the game will repeat at a tougher skill level.</p>",

As Dracula bites his victims, his actions will call the attention of the local constable who will try to slow him down by driving a stake into him.  Dracula can respond by either turning one of his victims into zombies to attack the police, or by transforming into a bat to escape capture.  Even the forces of nature are against the vampire, as wolves will attack him on foot, and hawks will drag away his bat form.

As a member of the bomb squad, it is the player's job to disarm the bomb before it explodes. </p>\n<p>Start the game with a view of the code number display which is damaged. In order to find the code which disarms the bomb, the player has to repair the various circuits in order to fix the display. By selecting a square on the code number display, the player will be brought to the corresponding circuit which can be repaired using cutters, pliers, and soldering iron. The player's partner, Frank, will guide through the repairs by telling the player what needs to be done, in what order repairs should be performed, and by helping the player position the tools. Depending on the circuit, the player may need to cut out parts or replace parts (spare parts are located at the top of the screen). If the player uses an incorrect replacement part, or perform the repairs in the wrong order, the player will lose time or even cause the bomb to explode. </p>\n<p>On the more difficult skill levels, circuit parts may even overheat and cause a fire; luckily, the player also has a fire extinguisher with you to deal with this situation! When enough circuits have been repaired, the player can decipher the code, enter it into the computer, and the bomb will be disarmed (an incorrect guess will cause it to explode, however). The player may choose to have a one, two, or three digit code to guess and several difficulty levels are available.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>White Water!</em> your goal is to raft down a river in the shortest time possible. The river features many dangerous turns, rocks, whirlpools, barrels, and other obstacles that get in your way. You begin your trip with three men, and if you don't navigate carefully they can fall out of the raft! If any men remain in the raft, they can try pick up anyone who has fallen out but must do so before they hit a rock, a whirlpool, or leave the screen (if all of your men fall out of the raft, the game will end). In the easier game variations, your score is based on how quickly you can reach the finish line. In the more difficult game variations, you not only need to reach the finish line as quickly as possible but also need to earn points by landing your raft at various beaches along the way and collecting treasures that can be found in the forest. Some of the treasures will be guarded by the natives, so be careful (also be sure not to wander too far into the forest, or you'll become lost). The game ends when you reach the finish line, or all your men are lost either by falling in the river or in the forest.</p>",

Two games are available: standard bowling and pick-up spares. Pick-up spares set the pins in a variety of ways to let you practice difficult shots.</p>\n<p>Options allow you to select 1 of 10 conditions of alley slickness and the weight of your ball. Players can also choose to be a right or left handed bowler. While trying to knock down the pins, you will need to control the curve and loft of the ball.</p>",

When it begins, a female voice welcomes you as the commander of the star ship. You have three star bases to defend while alien ships surround you. Then you choose a space sector where you enter in to the battle section. </p>\n<p>Your ship has 5 systems (Battle Computer, Impulse Drive, Hyper Drive, Tracking Computer and Shields): if your  ship is hit you can repair the damage at a star base. Repairs during battles are allowed, but they are slower, use ship's energy and can't repair destroyed ship systems. The game ends when you run out of energy and/or your ship is destroyed. The ship is destroyed when all the systems are destroyed, or if Hyper Drive blows the ship up (50% chance of this occurring if you use Hyper Drive when destroyed).</p>",

The object of the game is to be the first to move all your pieces completely around and finally off the board. Moving your pieces off the board is called \"bearing off\". The first player to bear off all his pieces is the winner. Each player moves in a direction beginning from his opponent's Home Table and coming around to his own Home Table. Thus one player always moves clockwise and the other always \ncounterclockwise.\nYou can play against the computer at two skill levels - one for beginners or intermediate, another for experts - or two players can compete against each other.

Peter Pepper must kick the Food Balls (red Meatballs, green Lettuce Heads, white Rice, tan Mashed Potatoes, and yellow Macaroni) scattered throughout the diner. The Food Ball will roll across the floor, down ramps, and over ledges. If it's close enough to the bottom of the screen, it will roll right onto the plate.</p>\n<p>When a plate is full, Side Orders appear in the diner: if Peter picks them up, he earns 250 points and 1 pepper. When he fills 4 plates (finish four game screens), he enters the Blue Plate Special bonus round: Food Balls start raining across the screen and Peter can eat all them, but the flashing ones, for extra points.</p>\n<p>With them he can squish the Rotten Food too, earning extra points. He can shake pepper to stop them momentarily or simply run away. If a Rotten Food touch him, he loses a turn. Peter can obtain a new turn every 20.000 points. If he run out of turns the game ends.</p>",

The game is based on real baseball player statistics (even though the names had been changed to fictional ones before the release) and offers baseball games using multiple cameras (including in-game split-screen), showing the game in a 3D display rather than side-scrolling fashion.</p>\n<p>It supports two players simultaneously, where a center camera is used to show pitcher and batter. While one player chooses the pitch type, the batter decides when to swing or bunt. The screen then switches to an external camera view for the defending player to control the fielders, while the other player handles the baserunners. The games can be saved and loaded through the RAM chip on the cartridge.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Take the role of Flynn in <em>TRON: Solar Sailer</em>, an Intellivoice game based on the movie TRON. Navigate your way through the computer world to find the MCP (Master Computer Program). Overload the MCP to escape the computer world and return to reality!</p>\n<p><em>TRON: Solar Sailer</em> is a 1-player game with 2 stages of gameplay. In stage one, the player is given an access code to write down, and then has to guide the solar sailer down tracks in the computer world with the goal of reaching Track 0, where the MCP is located. As the player traverses the tracks, tanks attempt to shoot the sailer and recognizers attempted to move the sailer farther away from Track 0. I/O beams teleport the player closer to the MCP if they can properly enter the access code given to them at the beginning of the game. Moving down a track and shooting at enemies depletes energy from the track; switching tracks restores energy to full. If energy fully depletes before the player switches tracks, the sailer stops moving and the game is over. Energy levels can be monitored by the amount of \"energy bugs\" on the grid surrounding the track, with more bugs meaning more track energy. An audible warning also announces when track energy is low.</p>\n<p>If the player makes it to Track 0, stage two begins. The player is placed in the heart of the MCP as it attempts to make continuous data transmissions to keep the player from entering the override code, thereby overloading the MCP and allowing Flynn to escape the computer program. 0s and 1s fly at the player in a first-person view. An in-game voice gives the player the override code in binary, and the player uses a cursor to catch the appropriate bits. Using the number pad, the player can then specify where in the code sequence the captured bit should go. Red bits, when colliding with the cursor, automatically fill in a randomly selected part of the sequence. This area is timed, so the code must be entered as quickly as possible!</p>\n<p>Once the correct sequence has been entered, the MCP overloads and the game is over. However, the game gives the option of going into \"Overtime Mode\" for extra points, at which point the player attempts to block all incoming transmissions or lose the game.</p>",

You control Scooby as he chases ghosts through a maze while himself being chased by the skull &amp; crossbones. If three ghosts are caught within a time-limit, the skull will disappear and a submarine sandwich appears. When eaten, it gives you a magic bone which when dropped in the path of the skull will momentarily freeze it in place. When Scooby is caught by the skull, the difficulty will go down. There's 10 mazes in all, but with the keyboard addon for Intellivision you can also make your own mazes.</p>",

There are nine Formations to choose from, and four options under Tactics. Formations can also be changed on the gameplay screen prior to the opponent team hiking the ball. Controls are pretty basic, only really involving the control wheel.</p>\n<p>The options for the Offensive team include Formation, Kick, Recover 1, Recover 2, Timeout, Stats, Controls, and Break. A \"program receiver\" appears under the Recover options. Like defense, there are nine formation options.
