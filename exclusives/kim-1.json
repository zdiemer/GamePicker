Moves are entered directly on the onboard keypad and the counter moves are shown on the 6-digit display. The player has to keep the state of the board manually. The game plays as expected with the player and computer taking turns placing tokens of their color on the board, claiming tokens of their opponent which they can enclose with their move. Once the whole board is full with tokens the player who owns most of the board wins.</p>",
