        "description": "<p>The hero of <em>Lunar: The Silver Star</em> is Alex, a young boy whose ideal is the great warrior of the past, Dragonmaster Dyne. But in order to become a Dragonmaster, Alex has to find the four great dragons who will grant him the permission. The girl Luna, with whom Alex is in love, accompanies him on his journey. But soon the young people discover that something, or someone, is trying to change the face of the world by resurrecting the ancient goddess Althena, with Luna being a key element in the plan.</p>\n<p><em>Lunar: The Silver Star</em> is a traditional Japanese-style RPG with turn-based battles. The characters in your party have distinct class attributes (fighter, priest, magic user, etc.). It is possible to move the characters over the battle field, which can sometimes prove strategically important (for example, spreading the characters to avoid being hit by an area spell).</p>",

The story picks up immediately after the end of the first game. You begin as Lester and his alien friend, \"Buddy,\" land their pterodactyl in the ruins of Buddy's village. Lester was knocked unconscious in their escape, so Buddy lays him down on a cot to rest. The people who used to live in Buddy's village remain enslaved, so he decides to go on a mission to free them. Thus, you control Buddy as he sets off to free the people and find a way to send Lester home.</p>\n<p>Buddy controls somewhat similarly to how Lester did in the first game. He has some new moves that are provided by his powerful energized whip. Buddy can swing from ceiling in some instances, for example.</p>\n<p>As a bonus, this Sega CD disc includes the original Out of this World, so that you can seamlessly play both adventures as if they were one long game.</p>",

Gameplay is similar: this is basically a 2D shooter with 3D graphics. You move your ship in a 2D plane that reaches into the screen, kind of like a pinball table. The Sega CD version of Silpheed uses pre-rendered video for the backdrops, and filled polygon graphics for the player ship and enemies. </p>\n<p>The story here is typical for a game of this type. The central computer system controlling the galaxy network has been hacked by terrorists. The terrorists are using the computer to attack colony planets throughout the system. You are the Galaxy Union's last resort: you must fight your way across 11 stages to reach Earth, and re-take control of the computer.</p>",

This game differs greatly from other Jurassic Park games. It is a point-and-click adventure game, with a strong emphasis on action sequences which require split-second timing.</p>\n<p>The story takes place after the events of the movie/book. You are sent back to Jurassic Park to retrieve dinosaur eggs from around the park and put them in an incubator. You only have 12 hours to retrieve one egg from every species of dino in the park. Unfortunately, shortly before arriving at the park, your helicopter crashes!</p>",

In reality Mail is having a hard time making ends meet. One day, however, she learns about a magician who has gone rogue and has a hefty bounty on his head. Her adventure begins as Popful fights her way through a new adventure, and makes new friends along the way.</p>\n<p><em>Popful Mail</em> is a platform action game with very light RPG elements. As the heroine makes her way through the stages she collects money from slain foes. This money can be used in shops to buy weapons, armor, health, and so on. The game features interaction with many characters through both on-screen dialog and fully animated sequences. Some of these characters become playable as the player progresses through the game.</p>\n<p>This release has the same story and general gameplay style as the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/44162/popful-mail/\"> earlier version</a>, but otherwise was made from scratch, having entirely different graphics, locations, enemies, challenges, etc.</p>",

        "description": "<p>1983, Tibet. A weary traveler approaches a figure standing on the peak of the mountain. \"You shall become human again...\" - says the man. Then we see that it was a woman he spoke to - a beautiful woman with a third eye on her forehead...</p>\n<p>Long ago, a powerful race called sanzhiyan, the Three-Eyed Ones, came to existence. Those were humans who discovered the secret of eternal youth, and therefore ceased to be humans. They controlled people and turned some of them into \"wu\" - obedient immortal servants without their own will. One girl stand up against this, a sanzhiyan named Parvati. She destroyed the leader of the sanzhiyan, the terrible Kaiyanwang. She tried to forget the past, living in a secluded area in Tibet under the name Pai. A Japanese scientist Fujii met her and tried to help her to become human again. But Fujii died, and only a letter to his son was left. Pai went to Tokyo and met Fujii's son Yakumo, a careless teenager who was working as a cross-dressing waiter. When her pet monster bird attacked Yakumo, she saved him by using the power of her third eye. But after Yakumo made contact with its mysterious power, he lost his true human nature and became her Wu! Now their destiny is tied together, as they try to regain their lost humanity and prevent Kaiyanwang's Wu, the cruel Benares, to resurrect his master.</p>\n<p><em>Seima Densetsu</em> (The Legend of the Divine Demon) is Sega's RPG entry into the library of games based on the anime series <em>3x3 Eyes</em>. The game attempts to include the entire story of the manga and anime, from the moment Yakumo first met Pai to the final confrontation, incorporating different story arcs, some of which are unique to this game. The game is a traditional Japanese-style RPG with world map exploration, towns and dungeons, randomly appearing enemies, and turn-based combat. Players select attacks from a menu, viewing the battle from first-person perspective. The executions of the attacks are displayed as animated sequences. </p>\n<p>Characters join and leave the party as dictated by the plot development. Leveling up is automatic; spells and techniques are learned by the characters when they meet the correspondent level requirements. The game features an anime-style intro and cutscenes with voice-overs for important characters.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Shadowrun</em> for Sega CD is a little-known game (and one of the very last ones released for this console) that is based on the FASA RPG of the same name and has only very little to do with its much more popular brethren for <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8662/shadowrun/\">SNES</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6649/shadowrun/\">Genesis</a>.</p>\n<p>It is twenty-first century, and the humanity faces a difficult period that follows devastating wars and other disasters. Magic and technology co-exist, supernatural powers, mythical creatures, ghosts, cyberspace, where hackers meet and fight each other, street deckers which can be hired to do the dirty work, anarchy and struggle between mighty and corrupt corporations - this is the world of <em>Shadowrun</em>. Unlike the two other <em>Shadowrun</em> games which are set in Seattle, according to tradition, <em>Shadowrun</em> for Sega CD is set in the futuristic city of Neo Tokyo. The player controls a party of characters with different backgrounds: the street samurai Rikudo, the shaman girl Mao, the decker (a hired mercenary) D-Head (who also happens to be an elf), and Shiun, a former member of a mighty corporation. Their first assignment is to hunt down a ghostly warrior who has been disturbing a segment of the city for quite some time. As the player begins their investigation they plunge deeper into the dark world of intrigues and find themselves fighting on different fronts.</p>\n<p><em>Shadowrun</em> for Sega CD (unlike its two other counterparts) is a distinctly Japanese game. It is a hybrid of the Japanese style of adventure, along the lines of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7524/snatcher/\"> Snatcher</a>, and turn-based party RPGs. In adventure mode, the player interacts with the game world by choosing commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", \"Move\", etc.) from a menu. There are no real puzzles, but rather realistic detective work: the player talks to people, gathers evidence, accesses the internet, talks to informers, and so on. But often they find themselves in places where they navigate their characters from a top-down view and fight enemies. The battles occupy the whole screen and the player can move around the battle field, using melee, long-ranged, and magic attacks, like in early <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Ultima\">Ultima</a> games. The outcome of an attack is decided by a dice roll. The player can stop the dices themselves or they can let the computer do the rolling for them. There are also cyberspace fights which occur when the player encounters a hostile hacker in the matrix world.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Urusei Yatsura: Dear My Friends</em> is a point-and-click adventure game based on the anime and manga of the same name. It is the story of Ataru, a high school lecher who loves nothing more than to try his luck with every pretty girl he meets. Although he is generally good-hearted, he does a good job of hiding that fact.</p>\n<p>One day, Earth is beset by alien invaders who will conquer the planet, unless a chosen representative is able to beat an alien representative in their national game: Tag. Incomprehensibly, Ataru is chosen for the task. His opponent is Lum, gorgeous daughter of the invaders' leader. Shinobu, Ataru's long-suffering girlfriend, tells him that she could never marry a loser, and that he had better win the game of Tag if he wants to marry her. Ataru is filled with new hope, and against all odds, he manages to tag the flying Lum. </p>\n<p>Ataru is overjoyed that he can now marry Shinobu, but Lum mistakes his victory cry as a marriage proposal. She immediately accepts, and then the two are inseparable - not that Ataru likes it that way. Lum's unconditional love poses no challenge, and Ataru misses the thrill of the chase. Unfortunately, Lum dishes out a massive electric shock every time Ataru so much as breathes in the direction of another girl, so he's stuck!</p>\n<p><em>Urusei Yatsura: Dear My Friends</em> is an original story of their adventures. It features full screen animation, and the original vocal cast of the animated series. The player advances the story by examining and interacting with on-screen objects using a cursor icon.</p>",

You control Hiro, a young treasure hunter who likes exploring various caves and ruins with his trusty companion, the wise-cracking pink flying cat Ruby (who claims to be a baby dragon). One day he meets a mysterious blue-haired girl named Lucia. She explains that she has come from the nearby Blue Star and now needs his help in order to defeat a dark being called Zophar. Bewitched by the girl's beauty, Hiro agrees to help Lucia, and soon finds himself opposing the ruling religion of the world, and shadows from the past.</p>\n<p>This is a Japanese-style RPG with turn-based combat viewed from top-down perspective, like the rest of the game. You fight with a party where each member belongs to a particular class and fights using his/her own techniques. Anime-style cutscenes are included to advance the story.</p>",

She meets Raphael and tells him about a war that happened 1200 years ago, and the legendary hero Spirit Rider. She notices that Raphael is wearing a strange ring on his finger, and suspects there is a connection between this ring and the legend. She invites Raphael to her palace, but then suddenly disappears. It seems that the young hero must first try solving the mystery on his own, before he finds friends who will help him on his journey.</p>\n<p><em>Fhey Area</em> is set in a medieval world, and is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. Your party travels on the world map, visiting towns, buying weapons and armor, and fighting random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat. During battles you see anime-style portraits of your characters to the right, and enemy portraits to the left. The picture changes when you perform an attack, cast a spell, are hurt, etc. The game features animated opening sequence.</p>",

        "description": "<p>300 years ago, the high priest of the Kingdom of Cheshire tried to disturb the balance of good and evil by summoning the dark god Arliman. Sabrina, Goddess of Light, saved the Kingdom by giving great powers to two of Cheshire's leaders who defeated the high priest and helped the King's high wizard to entrap Arliman in a magical jewel. Velonese, the high wizard's apprentice, was given the task of guarding the imprisoned Arliman on the Island of Raven. Over the years, his anger towards the kingdom grew and now he is commanding four generals to conquer Cheshire while he is trying to free Arliman.</p>\n<p>You take on the role of one of four playable main characters and must re-conquer the land that has already fallen into Velonese's hands and find a way to defeat him and prevent Arliman's resurrection. The four main characters feature largely different stories, however, every game begins with the King's death and your character becoming the new ruler of Cheshire.</p>\n<p>The most important part of the game takes place on various hex maps where you are fighting your enemies in turn-based tactical combat. During these battles your main character - provided he is standing on a castle-field - can summon various monsters like serpents, manticors, harpies etc. or hire human troops (Humans, Dwarfs, Elves and Hobbits). Monsters need magic points to be summoned, whereas humans have to be paid with tax money. Depending on which main character you have chosen, your amount of MP and tax money will vary, as well as the types of monsters you will be able to summon. Your troops, including your main character, gain experience points and humans can even adopt several different jobs (Priest, Mage, Ninja ...) through gaining classes. Your units can also enter towns during battles, to buy weapons and items, hear the latest gossip and maybe even discover a side-quest.\nIn-between battles, you can equip your troops, send out search parties and allocate troops to different towns, as they can be re-conquered by the enemy.</p>\n<p>Also noteworthy are <em>Dark Wizard's</em> long animated cutscenes with spoken dialogues and its high quality orchestral soundtrack.</p>",

It also re-vamps the gameplay system of the first game, allowing previously passive characters to participate in battles, but also increasing the amount of enemies met in battles. The difficulty levels has been modified; in particular, boss battles have become noticeably easier in the first installment. Many areas have been re-designed, often becoming more complex.</p>\n<p><em>Cosmic Fantasy 2</em> has undergone similar changes; the difficulty level is generally higher in this release, as enemies have learned new techniques that were absent in the original release, most notably attacks that inflict status ailments on the player-controlled characters.</p>",

After a win the player can improve his left and right glove abilities and stamina by assigning \"Power Points\" to each area.</p>\n<p>The only sprites visible during the bouts are the player gloves and the health indicators - the boxers and the rest of the ring are black and white FMV. As with other FMV games, the player can enable tips, which indicates to the player when to hit certain buttons.</p>",

The game centers around 10 battles of the film's 3 main characters.</p>\n<p>The player watches the video and hits the correct direction or button at the right time to achieve success. The visual cues of the movie suggest the correct buttons. For example, when the Masked Rider punches, the player should press the Punch button. If he dodges left on screen, the player should press the left direction pad. Correct timing hits the enemy harder, lowering their health bar. Failure reduces the players health.</p>\n<p>Completing the moves accurately will allow the player to \"defeat the monster early\" and watch the rest of the video as a reward.</p>",

Those they abduct return as Pod People-like drones, normal in appearance until they reveal themselves. The government's response is you - a technician driving custom-built gun cameras mounted around the town. Similar to Night Trap or Double Switch, you must monitor the town for alien activity, and respond to protect the lives of the citizens and your agents.</p>\n<p>The game is played entirely through four camera feeds from locations around the town. They mostly show loops of banal activity, but indicators will alert you when important action is occurring at that location. Switching to that camera will allow you to watch crucial plot clips, or defend that camera from aliens in a single-screen shooting gallery. As cameras take more damage, the picture from that feed degrades until the camera itself is destroyed.</p>\n<p>The goal is pretty much to juggle between cameras so as not to miss an important plot point, while defending them from attackers or saving citizens from being abducted. In a neat twist, citizens who you failed to save may appear later as disguised aliens themselves.</p>\n<p>As the game progresses, the invasion increases and becomes more violent, but the basic concept of switching between cameras and engaging in video shooting galleries remains unchanged.</p>",

As the last surviving pilot sent on a mission to thwart the Draxons' plans, all hope rests on you. Invade each of the fortified moons orbiting the Draxons' homeworld of Arctaurus and then aim for the mother planet itself.</p>\n<p>The action takes place in your hovermorph craft. In the game's introduction, the ship proves to be a deadly starfighter. When it enters the moon's atmosphere and approaches the surface, the hovermorph transforms into a powerful hovership. Blast away Draxon enemies, both ground- and air-based, from a first-person perspective on a 3D polygonal battlefield.</p>",

Much of the game consists of 3D driving action behind the wheel of the Batmobile. There are also levels in which the Caped Crusader must stage an aerial assault using the Batwing.

It supports up to four players with a choice of six different character classes: monk, knight, elf, mage, beast and ninja. The game starts in the area surrounding a save point. This area functions as a central hub to access all the six dungeons. If a character leaves it, the food counter starts decreasing. If it reaches zero, the life points start diminishing until the character dies. Food can be found as potions or pots around the mazes. Returning the character to the save point area replenishes all the counters and cures all conditions (like poisoning and confusion). The gold collected in the game can be spent on equipment upgrades at the weapons shop. The tavern allows the player to switch characters. </p>\n<p>The characters level up automatically as they amass the necessary experience points. Once a dungeon boss is defeated, the dungeon is locked and the player can't return to it. The game has four save slots, each one for an individual game.</p>",

Video discs literally roll down an assembly line while C + C record their sounds behind three closed doors. You are asked to help out in editing these videos, appease the corporate masters, and lift the burden from everyone.</p>\n<p>The game is played from a panel meant to resemble and act as a non-linear editor. Editing is entirely linear however, as three distinct video \"feeds\" run simultaneously along the bottom of the screen. Each is mapped to the A, B, or C button, and pressing one sends that video to master viewer, where it is recorded. The D-pad toggles various effects on and off from a bin in the upper left. One feed will always be of C + C's actual video, with the other two holding appropriate stock footage (like a doorbell timed to appear with the lyrics \"Ding dong, who is it?\").</p>\n<p>The video can not be stopped or rewound once the editing process begins, so the player must quickly route video to the viewer and apply effects within a given amount of time. This allows for editing challenges, where the player must fill specific requests, like having fast cuts or showing no dancers.</p>\n<p>After a video is edited, the player gets to watch their cut in its entirety. They are then graded by the FMV characters and move to the next song, or try a new edit of the previous one.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Make My Video: INXS</em> is a video game based on real-time editing of music video footage. The setup is that a pair of female friends is hanging around a bar and monopolizing the pool table. The game explores the duo's interpersonal interactions with other patrons at the bar: There's the Fly, an aloof cool guy; Ted and Gomez, braindead surfer dudes trying to pick up the ladies, and who are thinly-veiled parodies of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Bill+%26+Ted\">Bill &amp; Ted</a>; Poindexter, the nerd who is also trying to work up the courage to talk to the women; and Flo and Tiger, a pair of leather-clad tough chicks whose interest is beating the main subjects of the game so that they can control the bar music and play their Megadeth videotape. Each person or pair has own their ideas about what an ideal INXS video should or should not contain. The specifications normally come in the form of a set of pictures they either do or don't want to see, and perhaps some effects. The game features three INXS videos from which to choose: \"Heaven Sent\", \"Not Enough Time\", and \"Baby Don\u2019t Cry\".</p>\n<p>After receiving the video specifications, the player enters the video editing console in the EditChallenge mode. From this console, the player can view and select between 3 video streams that are playing. The selected stream will be edited into the final video. One stream is the original video while the other 2 feature assorted random footage that nonetheless often carries images that happened to have been specified in the video request. The video editing console also allows the player to apply a variety of real-time filters, such as mosaic and blur filters, RGB color filters, strobe and motion filters, lyric subtitles, among others.</p>\n<p>The game also allows the user to enter a mode called U-Direct. Rather than being competitive, U-Direct allows the player to use the console to create any type of video and also save the results.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Revengers of Vengeance</em> is a combination of RPG, vertical shooter, and fighting game with a fantasy/anime style. There are ten available characters, each with their own animated backstory and fighting techniques. You must choose a hero and guide their stats to create a formidable fighter capable of taking down the Devil King and freeing the land.</p>\n<p>In the Quest mode, you name your selected character and start at a lowly Level 1. The local town acts as a hub with opportunities for training, equipment purchases and rest. You can leave town and battle contenders for money in the fighting game. You can advance the story by taking quests from the town's guild, which are played in the vertical shooter game.</p>\n<p>The fighting engine is further explored in two side modes - Tournament and Arena of Death. Tournament acts as a basic fighting game, allowing 1 or 2 players to progress through the ranks with the stock characters. No customization is available in this mode.</p>\n<p>Arena of Death allows eight players to be created using the stock character templates. You assign attributes by shifting various bars between two extremes. You can then match these creations against each other and watch as the computer simulates a battle between them. The primary use of this mode appears to be testing various tactics against each other to decide how best to play your character.</p>",

Anett's magical powers are triggered by spending an energy bar that is constantly refilling, depending on the amount of power available you'll cause more damage all the way up to a screen-clearing attack.</p>\n<p>Uses 2D sprite-based graphics and features red book music as well as anime-styled cutscenes between each stage.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Although the package appears to be a compilation, this is the first and only release of <em>Ultraverse Prime</em>. Since it was originally envisioned as a SNES game but not completed, it was eventually released as a Sega CD title as a pack-in with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Microcosm\">Microcosm</a>, a game that was released separately before. As such this should be considered the base entry for <em>Ultraverse Prime</em>.</p>\n<p>It is a sidescrolling brawler game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Final+Fight\">Final Fight</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Streets+of+Rage\">Streets of Rage</a>. Players control the superhero Prime, a thirteen year-old boy called Kevin Green that has the power to transform into a superhero adult version of himself. Prime can punch, kick and jump, and combine these into some new moves and combos. The player as well as the enemies can also occasionally find weapons or objects to pick up and throw. Some stages are much faster as Prime flies at a fast speed and needs to punch obstacles and enemies out of the air.</p>\n<p>As a bonus, fifteen different Prime comic book issues can be accessed through the main menu, as well as video interviews with the writers and artists.</p>\n<p>The game design has the typical SNES feel, with no changes made to match the advanced options of the Sega CD platform. Compared to the SNES prototype, even though the graphics style is the same, the fighting style is slightly different and a 7-minute rock theme song was added along with the bonus features mentioned above.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ranma 1/2: Byakuran Aika</em> is an adventure/action game based on the anime series of the same name by manga writer Rumiko Takahashi. The game is designed to look as if you were watching any Ranma 1/2 episode or film, with the only difference that it will let you (in the role of Ranma) take active action in some points, from choosing on a list what to do or what to talk about with someone. Then, there's the element that decides whether you advance in the game or not, the fighting scenes. These will not be of the usual kind, but more like a Janken game, where rock, scissors and paper are substituted by attacks or blockings. Strong attacks will consume your KI bar but if they go in the right patch they will help a lot in reducing your rival's energy bar.</p>",

Set sometime in the late 20th century, when conflicts all over the world have erupted, and world peace is but a thing of the past.</p>\n<p>As the leader of one of 16 nations, your ultimate goal is none other than world domination. To accomplish this you have a multitude of options ranging from raw military might, diplomacy, foreign or domestic investment policy, aiding terrorists or revolutionaries, to media manipulation. In other words, it's just like the real world.</p>\n<p>The game offers 5 distinct scenarios, all of which require different strategies to win.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Batman Returns</em> on the SEGA CD is an enhanced version of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/38717/batman-returns/\">Genesis adaptation</a> of the movie. It includes the entirety of the original platform game, but adds all-new driving levels.</p>\n<p>The game can be played in three ways: either as only the platform game, only the racing game, or a combination of both. Each option features a unique ending sequence.</p>\n<p>For every of the original version's five platform levels, there is a related driving section in which the player controls either the Batmobile or the Batskiboat. Both in perspective and gameplay, these sections are reminiscent of arcade titles like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/16/outrun/\">OutRun</a>. Seen from above and behind, the player's vehicle must reach checkpoints before a timer runs out, receiving bonus points for any surplus seconds. The CD system's hardware is used for sprite scaling and other tricks, achieving a 3D effect.</p>\n<p>The game being based on an action-filled movie, there's not only driving but also shooting: both the car and the boat are armed with machine guns and heat-seeking missiles (with limited ammunition). Besides the roads being full of enemies in general, each level also ends in a boss fight against a big (and usually heavily armed) vehicle.</p>\n<p>The game features CD-based audio tracks, replacing those from the original.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Similar to adaptations of <em>The Terminator</em> on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=The+Terminator\">other systems</a>, the Sega CD game is a platformer where the player controls Kyle Reese, who travels back in time from the year 2029 to protect Sarah Connor from the unstoppable killing machine known as the Terminator.</p>\n<p>The game consists of 10 levels. Future locations include the post-apocalyptic wasteland of 2029 Los Angeles and the time displacement complex. In the present of 1984, Reese must traverse the streets and rooftops of L.A., as well as the Tech Noir club, the police station, and, for the finale, an automated factory. </p>\n<p>Reese is armed with a gun with unlimited ammo as well as a limited number of grenades to dispatch the many enemies, including Terminators and HKs in the future and punks in the present. In addition to these, several bosses must also be fought. The boss battles include several encounters with the Terminator, who naturally cannot be completely destroyed until the finale, but must be driven back to keep him from harming Sarah.</p>\n<p>Between levels, the game shows small digitized clips from the film that advance the storyline. The game also features a fully CD-based soundtrack with tracks ranging from heavy rock to electronic tunes.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mary Shelley's Frankenstein</em> is an adventure/fighting hybrid based on the 1994 film of the same name. You play as Frankenstein's monster and begin in the lab, where your creator rejects and banishes you in a dialogue sequence. From there, you must escape the village and try to find meaning in a hostile world. Subsequent levels mirror the general story arc of the film and novel.</p>\n<p>The game plays through three distinct modes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Exploration Mode takes place inside buildings, and gives you a side-scrolling view of the Monster. Like a standard adventure, you can examine nearby objects and add them to a limited inventory. You use those items to solve puzzles or open up new pathways. Should you encounter a hostile foe in this mode, you will automatically switch to Combat Mode.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Combat Mode plays and looks like a standard 2-D fighting game. You have buttons to punch, kick, or block, and corresponding D-pad directions that activate different moves. Your goal is to drain your opponent's energy while preserving your own. Winning the fight allows you to continue on.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Long View Mode is an isometric travel view similar to an RPG. Here, you search for new buildings to enter or navigate mazes (such as a forest).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The game shifts between hand-drawn art and 3-D computer graphics. Video clips from the film also introduce the game, and play at critical plot points.</p>\n<p>The package includes a complete CD and a manual for <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=090451601062\">Bram Stoker's Dracula</a> as an added bonus.</p>",

Because of the release of the Saturn this title was never brought outside Japan. Like <em>Last Armageddon</em>, this game is a turn-based RPG in which the player controls a group of demons in a post apocalyptic world.</p>\n<p>The story takes place in the future, hundreds of years after the extinction of mankind due to a nuclear holocaust. Demons are the rulers of the planet now, but they are engaged in battle for the dominion of the earth by some aliens/robots. \nThe gameplay is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Final+Fantasy\">Final Fantasy</a> and nearly identical to Last Armageddon. Battles are turn based and, like in <em>Last Armageddon</em>, blocking prevents all the damage from the enemy.</p>",

Like the earlier TurboGrafx CD version, it focuses on the adventures of the novel cycle's main hero Parn, his best friend Etoh, and the lovely high elf shaman Deedlit, but concrete events and locations are entirely different.</p>\n<p>Instead of the more traditional Japanese RPG-style world map top-down navigation and random battles, this version has a linear world map and pre-set battles. The strategic element of the battles is stronger, since the battle screens are larger and it is not possible to set battles on auto. Each attack is shown graphically on a separate screen. Hostile areas have standard top-down navigation, while towns are viewed from first-person perspective, and the navigation in them is menu-based.</p>\n<p>The game has voice acting and real anime movie sequences instead of the usual 2D cut-scenes characteristic for anime-style Sega CD games.</p>",

Players, controlling Jonathan Harker can move left and right on the screen, jump in the air, perform a high kick and rapidly punch. Using these skills, Jonathan must defeat all manner of enemies including bats, zombies, vampires. Powerups can be found at various points, usually descending from the top of the screen. These include: an invulnerability powerup which also instantly kills enemies, a health restore powerup.</p>",

Worse, the Kingpin has convinced the citizens that Spider-Man is the bomb's mastermind, and they're now out for his radioactive spider blood.</p>\n<p>To clear Spider-Man's name, the player must guide him through multiple levels and familiar super-villains in search of the bomb's keys - all while the 24-hour time limit mercilessly counts down. At Spidey's disposal are a range of hand-to-hand combat moves, plus web tricks including stunning web shots, web swings, and a web shield. Players can even form combos of web strikes and Spidey fists. And in a fairly uncommon platform maneuver, Spidey can stick to and crawl along any surface; including up walls and across ceilings.</p>\n<p><em>The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin</em> for the Sega CD takes the idea and basic gameplay from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Spider-Man+Vs.+the+Kingpin\">Genesis version</a>, but makes some significant changes. There are new levels, new bosses, and an expanded set of combat moves. The player now has the freedom to select the next level or boss to tackle from a map screen. Graphics have also been redrawn and expanded from the Genesis release. However, the player can no longer rest and heal at Peter Parker's apartment, or take photographs of enemies for cash; both prominent features of the Genesis version.</p>\n<p>Animated cutscenes with voices are new to this version, as well as a new CD soundtrack. The player can also find and collect digital versions of classic <em>Spider-Man</em> comics, making further use of the multimedia storage space. A password system has also been added to save the player's progress.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the year 2500, humanity is attacked by the alien Gurzons. The Earth Defense Force doesn't stand a chance, and whole cities are laid to waste by the evil invaders. There is still hope, however: enemies of the Gurzons from the planet Prism offer their help. If just a few EDF pilots can make it to Prism, they will be provided with the ultimate weapon which may turn the tide: the A/X 101 system. Controlling one of four starfighters launched on the mission, it is the player's job to break the orbital blockade, make it to Prism and then take the fight to the enemy.</p>\n<p>The game is an on-rails shooter, with gameplay seen from a first-person cockpit perspective. The player's ship moves automatically through pre-rendered space and planetary environments and only the targeting crosshair can be moved freely. Laser Cannons and Fusion Warheads are available to hit the numerous enemies. Lasers have unlimited ammunition but need a few moments time to recharge. The warheads function as smart bombs and clear the screen of enemies, but are available only in limited supply. They are restocked when reaching a certain score. The ship's energy shield functions as a life bar.</p>\n<p>Between the shooting levels, there are transitional cutscenes, pre-rendered in the same way as the actual gameplay.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Road Rash</em> for Sega CD is another title in the series, this time it's an attempt to mate the classic gameplay of Genesis Road Rash games with full-motion video and avant-garde rock soundtrack.</p>\n<p>This game was released the same time with the famous <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/17194/road-rash/\">3DO Road Rash</a>. And it borrowed a lot of content from the Panasonic 3DO version: all the FMV videos, CD-quality soundtrack and overall menu design. The quality of FMV and music is inferior to 3DO version given the limitations of Sega CD hardware. Graphically and gameplay-wise the game is a continuation of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6642/road-rash-ii/\">Road Rash II</a> for Sega Genesis.</p>\n<p>There are five race tracks that grow longer with each level; the tracks are named after those in the 3DO version: The City, Sierra Nevada, Peninsula, Napa Valley and Pacific Highway. Aside from the names the tracks themselves are completely different and represent the classic Sega Genesis Road Rash gameplay, slightly enhanced with more objects added on the roadsides.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The game's story is based on a mini-anime series, with extracts from the anime being used for cutscenes between the levels. The story centers on a man named Ryo, who begins working for a company called Yaesu as a replacement for his friend Masato. During a test ride with a new machine, however, he is somehow thrown into another dimension. After being rescued there by a group of mecha pilots from vile creatures named Devastators, he learns that nefarious people are working on a connection between that and his own dimension, and sets out to stop them.</p>\n<p><em>Devastator</em> is a run &amp; gun-style platformer with shoot-'em-up segments. The player controls a humanoid mech with a mid-range weapon, which can be described as a sickle on a chain, and one of three different long-range weapons. The goal in each level is simply to reach the end and defeat a boss. Most of levels consist of platforming, but sometimes the gameplay switches to a horizontally scrolling shoot-'em-up. Weapons can be upgraded by collecting items left by defeated enemies, similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5656/turrican/\">Turrican</a> games, but the protagonist may only have one long-range weapon; picking up another replaces the old one. There is only one type of standard upgrade item. To select a weapon, the player has to shoot the power-up until it shows the correct symbol.</p>",

Both teams are represented by clips from 25 years of NFL archive footage. The game is quite simple to play: each team chooses a play, then footage is played showing the outcome of the selected choices and the in-game display is updated to reflect the new standing. It is possible for a single player to be the coach of either team, for two players to go head-to-head, or to watch the computer select plays for both teams -- just like watching a real football game!</p>",

The entire game, including towns and building interiors, is explored from a 3D third-person perspective; individual rooms and transitional areas are navigated in a point-and-click adventure game style. Battles play out in a semi-active fashion, with the player giving each character specific commands, which they will follow until instructed to do otherwise.</p>",

The game features three unrelated episodes, each focusing on a different character, and each with multiple endings... though none of them could really be described as \"good\". The game proceeds mostly in standard adventure game style, with the only real interaction being dialogue choices or clicking on objects to investigate them, though there are a handful of minigames sprinkled throughout that will also affect the story outcome.</p>",

However, he quickly finds out that he was not only captured, but turned into a superweapon, able to harness electricity in moments of extreme duress. Now he must use his powers to find a way to stop those who would use him in their plans.</p>\n<p><em>A-Rank Thunder Tanjouhen</em> has a strong focus on narrative, and its mechanics are designed to facilitate that. Players progress through the story by speaking with key NPCs, and occasionally fight combatants through a rudimentary card-based battle system. The most notable aspect of play is the Live Interactive Picture system: during dialogue, the player may be asked to manage Yutaka's emotional state through dialogue choices. He will perform better or worse in the combat systems depending on the player's choices.</p>",

The game follows the adventures of the young girl Lip Ohtake, who secretly can transform into the magical girl hero Silky Lip.</p>\n<p>The gameplay consists of three main modes. The main adventure mode allows the player to control Lip and explore the school and other locations from a top-down perspective; she can speak with other characters, investigate objects, and use or give items to solve simple puzzles. Conversations with other characters sometimes switch to conversation mode; in this mode, the player does not select specific things to say, but rather selects from a list of emotions such as \"angry\", \"sad\", or \"happy\" to determine each response, and these choices affect the characters' relationships and how each chapter plays out. Finally, certain events initiate battle mode, in which the player can command Lip to use various magic spells, attempt to speak with her opponent, or run from battle; these battle sequences have no lose condition, though the outcome can affect the progression of the story.</p>",

Unlike most games set in this time period such as the famous <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/463/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-series/\">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a>, it is not based on the classic Chinese novel of the same name, but rather is based on the historical <em>Records of the Three Kingdoms</em> which was in turn the basis of famous the novel.</p>\n<p>Gameplay consists primarily of managing resources and diplomacy through a nested menu system, allocating soldiers and other resources to generals across the regions controlled by the player. There are a total of six scenarios to play, and 10 different playable generals to choose from.</p>",
