        "description": "<p>The year is 2058. Following an event known as the Awakening, magic has returned into the world. Native American shamans and elves reclaimed a vast area known as Salish-Shidhe, located around the free city of Seattle. A small team of shadowrunners - mercenaries working for powerful corporations - is brutally attacked in the wilderness. The massacre is captured in video and broadcast in the news. One of the slain shadowrunners, Michael, had a brother named Joshua. Arriving in Seattle, Joshua begins to investigate his brother's death. He must find out who killed Michael, and what was the nature of the shadowrun job he was carrying out.</p>\n<p><em>Shadowrun</em> is an action-oriented role-playing game based on the pen-and-paper RPG by FASA. It is entirely different from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8662/shadowrun/\">SNES adaptation</a> of the same license. In the beginning of the game, the player selects a character class for Joshua, choosing between a samurai, a decker, or a gator shaman, who specialize in combat, cyberworld, and magic, respectively. The game is fairly open-ended; the player navigates Joshua through predominantly urban overhead areas, talking to characters and gathering information. </p>\n<p>The player can hire characters to join the party; however, only one character can be directly controlled by the player. Combat is action-based; characters can use melee weapons, firearms (with expendable ammunition), or cast magic. \"Karma\", an equivalent of experience points, is awarded for killing enemies and completing quests. Karma points can be allocated by the player manually to increase the character's parameters.</p>\n<p>Certain characters can also enter the Matrix, a virtual network accessed through cyberterminals. Matrix navigation is done from over-the-shoulder third-person view. The player can upgrade and customize Joshua's cyberdeck, allowing him to hack through encrypted systems more easily and store data obtained from the Matrix. Nodes and ICs will try to protect the data, attacking the virtual representation of the character and trying to force him to log out of the system.</p>",

The goal of the game is to knock out certain targets in the two lower screens in order to gain access to the top screen.  Once you get the ball into the top screen, you can hit a ramp shot to advance to the next level.  All told, there are nine levels, each with varying goals to complete. </p>\n<p>Four players can play in a round, with each player taking turns. There's also a bonus game where you play pong versus freaky exploding skeleton things.</p>",

He announces to New York that a bomb has been planted somewhere around the city, and that it will detonate in 24 hours. To make matters worse, he lays the blame on Spider-Man, and now the webslinger is on his own, and on the run from the police. Spidey smells a rat, and he knows what he must do.</p>\n<p>Spider-Man has 24 hours to find and disarm the bomb. He must also clear his name, so he takes his camera to take convincing photos for his Spider-Man hating boss, J. Jonah Jameson, and the police, to prove his innocence. Along the way, he may also run into a few of his old foes, including Dr. Octopus, Electro, The Lizard, The Sandman, The Hobgoblin, Venom and ultimately The Kingpin himself.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Ranger X was released fairly late in the lifetime of the MegaDrive. Coming from an unknown developer, it was released with little fanfare and advertising but has become one of the best demonstrations of what the Genesis/MegaDrive is capable of.</p>\n<p>The game is a side scrolling shooter of sorts. You control a large mech (robot) which has a smaller vehicle-like sidekick mech. The two can join together, providing an alternate shooting mode. Whilst controlling just the main mech however, the player can shoot both forward and back by using different buttons. The mech can also use its rocket pack to boost off of the ground and hover for a short while. Levels are not necessarily moving from left to right (although for the most part they are) and the game is an interesting blend of platform game and shoot 'em up.</p>\n<p>The game features innovative graphics given the hardware limitations - there is a 3D introduction to most levels (remembering that the console had no 3D capability and a tile-based renderer) and some levels use a line-based scrolling effect to give the impression of 3D backgrounds.</p>",

The ultimate goal is defeat all the primary realms and achieve inner-peace. </p>\n<p>Through your travels you have to defeat bosses in each of the four realms of air, water, fire and earth to proceed and acquire weapons that'll help you on progress in other realms. Chakan can acquire the mallet, scythe, grappling hook and axe along with his standard swords and depending on what weapons is equipped, different abilities are unlocked. Some weapons allows for double jumping for instance, while others can tear down walls.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the player is able to collect potions that can be used in alchemy. By pressing \"Start\" at any time, one can create various spells that enhance the character like higher jumping, putting fire on your blades or even invisibility. Some levels actually requires you to use specific spells to progress, forcing you to think outside the borders of a normal platform game. On top of all this, there's an imposed time limit on each level.</p>",

        "description": "<p>After the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=FIFA+International+Soccer\">first game</a> proved to be a worldwide success, EA developed this sequel exclusively for Sega's 16-bit console. The biggest change from <em>FIFA International Soccer</em> are obviously the dozens of club teams from England, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, United States, Spain and Brazil, taking the team number tally to over 200. This also increased the number of competitions, with each country having it's own League, Tournament and Playoff. Also new, a battery backup allowed to save up to four competitions in the cartridge, replacing passwords. For those who want to settle things the fast way, a Penalty Shootout training mode was added.</p>\n<p>While graphically the game only received minor changes to the isometric sprite engine, gameplay feature new moves such as volley kicks and more detailed headers (now more effective), as well as general controls being more responsive facilitating passing play, and goalkeepers now are smarter when chasing balls. Set pieces also received a new format, and instead of just kicking the ball the player can choose to play a predefined set piece.</p>",

The player can take the role of either Batman or Robin but this choice doesn't make a difference regarding gameplay. </p>\n<p>This is a side-scrolling action game. The player basically walks from left to right while fighting numerous foes in hand-to-hand combat. Weapons which are found during the levels are used to shoot enemies from a greater distance. These weapons can also be upgraded by picking up the corresponding symbols. </p>\n<p>There are overall four areas (one for each villain) with three levels each, including a film studio or the Gotham University. While most stages are typical fighting levels with occasional 3D effects there are also a few flying ones where the player uses the Batwing or a jet pack.</p>",

They can't see you, so your only means of scaring them is by possessing various objects throughout the household.  For example, possessing a piece of furniture would cause something to fly out from it, and possessing an object would make it come alive in some way or another.  You need to act quickly because you have something called \"ecto\" which acts as the fuel that allows you to roam the real world.  You're awarded more ecto each time a family member exits the room.  The more scares you did, the more ecto you gain.  Losing all ecto sends you to the underworld where you have to regain your ecto to full capacity in order to go back into the real world.</p>",

Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are taken to a magic world and have to get back home. In order to do that, they can play magical tricks and interact with each other in a two-player cooperative mode.</p>\n<p>Like many other Disney games of the time period, the game has cartoon-like graphics and is played as a side-scrolling platformer. Both Mickey and Donald can run, jump, or attack with their capes. Magic spells are learned after boss battles, and are later used as transportation means, e.g. flying on a magic carpet, building a bridge out of cards, etc.</p>\n<p>While Mickey can squeeze through certain gaps, Donald must find alternate routes in the single-player mode. If two players are controlling them, Mickey can pull Donald through a gap. The two can also stand on each other's shoulders and lower ropes to access certain areas.</p>",

It's a unique blend of sports and sci-fi, and the actual football is the good ol' smash-mouth kind, literally.</p>\n<p>Dynamite throwing running backs, blitzing trolls, robots that bleed oil, it's all here. Opposing quarterback connecting on too many passes? Blitz him 'til he's dead. Suspect the ref's been bribed by the other side? Call a Kill Ref audible; it's a 5 yard penalty though. </p>\n<p>Take your pick from nineteen teams, including three All-Star teams. There are five difficulty levels and a slow/fast game speed toggle. A tournament mode awaits those who want something more than a quick game versus the computer or a friend.</p>\n<p>There are nineteen different fields to play on, all with there own special quirks. The Hellfield is littered with mines and fire pits to put an end to a careless runner, while The Pen is a slippery sheet of ice.</p>",

This is important to note, as the most damaging attack of the game could be just executed from far away of your opponent, the energy fireball projectiles. These special attacks also need that you have your KI bar (which unlike energy one, is rechargeable) to a considerable level and the only way to block them is by means of a long button combination.</p>\n<p>The constitution of the characters is based strictly on the Freezer and Cell sagas (Son Goku SSJ, Son Gohan SSJ2, Piccolo, Vegeta SSJ, Future Trunks SSJ, Krilin, Recoome, Giny\u016b, Freezer, A-18 and Perfect Cell), with special mention to Krilin, Giny\u016b and Recoome, who made here their first appearance in a fighting game. There are also 9 scenarios available, all of them corresponding to recognizable areas of the anime itself, some also appearing for 2 times but in different status (i.e., \"normal\" Namek and Namek \"in flames\").</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters</em> is a fighting game in the tradition of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Mortal+Kombat\">Mortal Kombat</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Street+Fighter\">Street Fighter</a> series, pitting the player against one opponent at a time. The game features eight fighters: the four turtles, Casey Jones, April O'Neil, Ray Fillet (from the comics) and the original character Sisphyus.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is similar to other games in this genre: each character has standard attacks (normal and strong) as well as special attacks which require button combinations to perform. The goal is to deplete the other fighter's life energy completely. However, a losing opponent has one last straw: a very powerful attack which is only unlocked shortly before death. The amount of rounds can be set between one and seven.</p>\n<p>The game's modes include a story mode, in which the selected hero has to battle against Krang's evil clones of the player characters in order to save the kidnapped Splinter, a two-player mode, a practice mode and a tournament mode which requires the player to fight against multiple opponents one after another with only one life bar.</p>",

She has only one weapon to dispose of enemies: thunder magic. This magic is auto-aiming and can track multiple targets. However, her quest is no easy task as the levels are loaded with fantasy-inspired monsters. Using thunder magic reduces a magic gauge, meaning you often have to wait for it to recharge. Once fully charged Alisia can unleash a massive rolling blast of lightning across the screen.</p>\n<p>During the game, you can improve your magic by picking up potions. There are also four monsters which accompany Alisia: Dragon Frye, Ball O'Fire, Thunder Raven and Boomerang Lizard. Each has different abilities, deciding which, if any, to use in a given situation is part of the challenge. These monsters, like Alisia herself, are fully upgradeable with power-ups. They can also die if weakened too much, forcing you to hunt for a reviving power-up. You can pause the game and select your companion at any time.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Following the previous <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Road+Rash\">two Road Rash games</a>, the player has conquered the US illegal motorcycle championship. But why settle for that when one can take over the World; racing in the peaceful streets of the UK, dodging the animals in Kenya, blaze through the night in Japan or jump in the hilly circuits in Italy?</p>\n<p>Keeping the same spirit of the previous two games, <em>Road Rash 3</em> adds all new digitized sprites (based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=014633072518\">Sega-CD remake</a> released an year earlier), bike upgrades, more weapons and meaner police. Most other aspects of the game remain unchanged: the player starts on the lowest division with a small amount of cash and a slow, hard to handle bike. To get more money (and get a faster bike) the player must beat as many of the other 15 racers to the finish line, using all means possible, even kicking and punching them into knockout. By clearing (finishing on the top three spots) all five races on a level, the player advances to the next, where opponents are faster and tougher, the police is more active and a longer race.</p>\n<p>As for new gameplay elements in the final title in the series released for Sega's 16-bit console, bikes can also be improved by choosing cheaper upgrades (instead of simply buying new ones) such as tires (less skidding), engine (improves acceleration and top speed), suspension (allows better control while landing after jumps) and body (bike takes more hits before turning into smoking metal). Instead on relying on simple motorbike patrols, the police now has helicopters at their disposal (which try to land on the player) and patrol cars, which attempt to block the path of the bike, forcing it to stop or collide to get a bust. To make things easier (or harder), new weapons were added, some of which allow the carrier to stun an opponent for a few seconds, making him the perfect victim for an incoming vehicle. Also new, if the player finishes the race with a weapon, carries it to the next race.</p>\n<p>Each track has its own features: in the UK, cars drive left on a rainy day, in Australia and Kenya animals wander into the road, in Brazil bikers can get themselves a close-encounter with a car on a crossing, in Italy the hills allow a lot of air-time for light and speedy bikes, Germany, where the icy roads and sharp turns make a deadly combination and finally in Japan the race goes during the night under the neon lights.</p>",

You basically drive on a freeway trying to catch up with five criminals who have committed felonies, but time is against you. If you catch up with the criminal's vehicle, you can ram into it to do some damage. If you do enough damage, the car malfunctions and you arrest the suspect. You can also use up to three turbo boosters that comes equipped with the car if you are far behind the suspect.</p>\n<p>However, what makes this game different is the fact that you can choose one of three vehicles to drive: a sports car, 4-wheel drive, and a semi truck, with each one of them having their advantages and disadvantages. For example, the truck may be slow in speed, but can do a massive amount of damage. The sports car, on the other hand, can perform at higher speeds, but has a poor attack efficiency. As well as passing cars, your task is made difficult by obstacles, such as barricades, on the freeway. Finally, some vehicles in the game will have someone shooting at you. And watch out for the helicopter that attempts to drop bombs on you.</p>",

Every second level is a side-scrolling platformer where you take the role of the human kids Cecilia or Louie and move through obstacles to get to the end of the level. These levels are set at various New York locations including a TV studio and a circus that wants to keep the dinosaurs as an exhibit. Every other level is a 3D level where you play one of the dinosaur characters, e.g. skateboarding on the back of a pickup truck as Rex or flying as Elsa over central park while collecting balloons.

        "description": "<p>It has been a while since the escape in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/13691/splatterhouse-2/\">Splatterhouse 2</a> and Rick is slowly regaining his sanity. At night, he is still haunted by nightmares from the place. Rick has married Jennifer and they have a son, David. In the final chapter of this horror trilogy, Rick finds out that an entity called The Evil One has kidnapped his beloved family members. He has no choice but to wear the demon mask with the supernatural powers to save Jennifer and David from the demon-infested Splatterhouse.</p>\n<p>The third title in the series builds upon the gameplay of its predecessors. The game consists of six consecutive levels in a huge mansion. In a race against time, you have to wipe the demons from each room and find the quickest path to the boss area. After clearing a room, you can use an in-game map to decide upon the quickest route. Improvements over the second title include moving between rooms in multiple directions, multiple endings based on your performance, special moves for Rick and crisper graphics.</p>\n<p>It still has a horror theme and maintains the same level of gore and violence. You can collect weapons such as a skull-smashing baseball bat, an ax and cement blocks. If you get knocked down, a ghost will try to snatch your weapon and drop it in another room of the house. Other collectible items include extra lives, health meat or orbs. These orbs build up a power meter. Upon completion, you have the ability to transform into a berserk mutant for a short time. The cutscenes feature real actors who act out the characters.</p>",

The duel takes you through six worlds with three levels each.  In order to move on to the next world, you have to destroy the vehicle of your opponent, who has kidnapped the girl in each final level. Both singleplayer and multiplayer modes have horizontal split screens, which can be used strategically to slow down your rival.</p>\n<p>The cowboys can jump, pick up weapons and dash at regular intervals to gain some extra speed. In order to win the level, you need to make use of the many obstacles. Some are meant to slow you down, but others, such as running shoes, skateboards or jump pads, can be used to improve your speed. There are multiple paths for each level as well.</p>",

Whenever you are attacked or attack a monster that is within your current range, a turn-based battle starts immediately without taking you to a separate fighting area, and you have to fight all enemies that were visible the moment the battle started.</p>",

Their mission is to find and make allies in this new world or else the kingdom and its culture will perish.</p>\n<p>The player leads a party of four characters (either the default party or one that the player has created).

        "description": "<p><em>Sparkster</em> is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7397/rocket-knight-adventures/\">Rocket Knight Adventures</a> and is completely different from the contemporary SNES title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/46529/sparkster/\">Sparkster</a>. It takes place immediately after the events of the first game. The interactive introduction scene shows Sparkster picking up a new sword after the final fight when his nemesis Axel Gear appears, the rocket knight gone evil. After a fight in giant robots, Sparkster manages to save Princess Cherry and returns her to the queen. Then suddenly Axel appears again and he kidnaps her. It turns out Axel is working once more for the Empire of Gedol. Sparkster has to return the peace in Kingdom of Zebulos, save the princess and bring an end to the evil empire.</p>\n<p>The game consists of six levels with 2D side-scrolling platformer gameplay. The opossum Sparkster can move around, jump and attack with his sword. Using his rocket pack, he can also perform stronger attacks and burst through the air in different directions. The rocket power consists of a double meter that refills gradually, making it possible to perform successive attacks in the air, ricocheting off walls. The first meter allows for the strongest attacks, but fills more slowly. Sparkster collects diamonds, apples to restore health and different types of power-ups for his sword. Most levels have typical platform gameplay, but there is also a level where Sparkster walks around in a giant robot, knocking enemies out of the air.</p>\n<p>For an additional challenge players can locate the seven swords hidden throughout the levels. When all of them have been found, the hero turns into Golden Sparkster. The game includes a password system.</p>",

        "description": "<p>For a long time, our world was in darkness. The sun shone as always, but our souls were dark and lacked the true enlightenment. Then the holy Nexus arrived, and changed everything. With his Rod of Creation, he blessed the people with the gift of the six Arts. The Red Priests - the people he chose among the others - established an order of the six Guilds. The world entered the era of prosperity. But the evil demon Void stole the Rod of Creation and drove the world to chaos again. In a cosmic battle, Nexus faced Void. None was victorious, and the Rod of Power was broken during the battle. It was divided into eleven rings, known as the Rings of Power. The young sorcerer Buc is now sent on a quest to retrieve those rings, and unite the Rod of Power that will eventually banish Void forever!</p>\n<p><em>Rings of Power</em> is quite different from traditional console RPGs gameplay-wise, and is more similar to Western-style games such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8812/ultima/\"> Ultima</a> series. You can freely wander through the huge isometric world, and are not obliged to follow any storyline except the main quest for the eleven rings. You can talk to NPCs about many topics, choose whom to fight, bribe people, etc. There is a day/night cycle which affects the behavior of characters. Unlike most RPGs, there are no weapons and armor in this game. The turn-based combat is entirely dependent on magic spells. On your journey you will encounter characters from several guilds, each proficient in his own type of magic, and make them join your party.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Fushigi no Umi no Nadia</em> is one of the several games based on the anime series <em>The Secret of Blue Water</em>. The series (and the game) are loosely based on the stories by the French science fiction author Jules Verne. The game is set in 1889, a time of great inventions and technology progress unseen before. The player controls Jean, a young genius scientist. In Paris he meets Nadia, an African circus performer. Nadia wears a pendant that contains magical powers, and that is why the evil Gargoyle is after her - this pendant is just the item she needs to build the ultimate weapon, the Tower of Babel. Jean will do anything to protect Nadia, and hope that his love to her, his adventurer spirit, and the power of science will eventually defeat Gargoyle.</p>\n<p>Unlike most Japanese adventures, <em>Fushigi no Umi no Nadia</em> is a top-down, third-person perspective game, in which the player physically navigates the character around. Nadia and other friends join Jean in a RPG-like fashion (although there is no combat in the game, different characters have their own item-based abilities that should be used at certain points). There are no real puzzles in the game, but the player has to use inventory items on several occasions in order to advance.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the manga and anime series <em>Y\u016b Y\u016b Hakusho</em>, this is a story of a teenager delinquent Yusuke Urameshi, who was hit by a car while trying to save a child. However, there was no place found for him either in paradise or in hell, and Koenma, the son of the death god Enma, sends him back to our world, where he has to be an \"occult detective\", fighting against demons. Several characters join him on his quest: Kazuma Kuwabara, his ex-rival and best friend; Kurama, a 1400-year-old demon fox; and Hiei, formerly a demon who tried to conquer the world and had to repent for his sins by helping Yusuke.</p>\n<p>You must play the individual chapters of the four playable characters (Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, and Hiei), until in the final chapter you control them all in the ultimate confrontation against evil forces. The game is a Japanese-style adventure (no puzzles, menu-driven interface) with the addition of battles. The battles proceed in real time; the protagonist can kick, punch, defend, and use special techniques. Unlike most Japanese adventures, you view the game world from a third-person perspective, although you cannot move physically.</p>",

At the end of the twentieth century, satellites around the globe are being shot down, disrupting communications. Secret agency Rolling Thunder discovers the organization behind the terror: Geldra. While agents Leila and Albatross are fighting the leader Gimdo (RT2), agent Jay is instructed to bring down Dread, the second-in-command.</p>\n<p>There are many improvements to the gameplay: Jay can shoot while jumping and shoot diagonally upwards with certain weapons. At the beginning of each mission, you can pick a special weapon such as a laser rifle, bazooka, flamethrower or grenades. You have to choose carefully as they cannot be reused in later missions. You can still hide in doorways and recharge your weapons behind special doors. The mission timer from the previous game has been replaced by a sniper that targets you with a crosshair when you don't move fast enough. The brutal difficulty from the previous games has been toned down: there are more life marks at the start and you now resurrect where you died, rather than returning to the last checkpoint. Unlike the previous game, you can only choose one character to play with.</p>\n<p>After completing a mission, a password is provided to continue playing. There are ten levels in total, with a few hidden areas.</p>",

They fought Jardine until there was no more than four remaining. The four combined their powers to form the Elemental Blade with which the demon king could be slain. At this time the Jewel Master was summoned to wield the blade, however the blade has been lost and the rings of the elemental masters have been scattered across Mythgard, all save two. The Jewel Master must gather the other ten rings of the Elemental Masters and reclaim the blade and ultimately do battle with the demon king.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is based on fighting a lot of monsters in classic arcade platform kind of way. To do this you have at your disposal rings, two which you begin with and further more that you gain along the way. Each ring is of one of the four elements and by combining them you gain different effects. Rings of opposite elements cancel each other but you have two hands and two attack buttons so you can use say water on the one and fire on the other. The rings are also different in strength which further adds some complexity.</p>",

Defeated by the demon, the prince is saved by a mysterious force, and is teleported out of the town, to a remote village, where his adventure truly begins.</p>\n<p><em>Surging Aura</em> is Japanese RPG in anime style.

Enemies will attack even if the player doesn't perform any action during the battle. The game features full screen anime-style pictures as cutscenes.</p>",

Suddenly, a blue sphere fell from the sky, becoming the ball which the paddles can now push forwards, overcoming obstacles and defeating demons.</p>\n<p><em>Devilish</em> is different from other paddle games by letting you play with two paddles. The lower one behaves just like a usual paddle - you use it to prevent the ball from dropping down. The upper one can move and turn, allowing you to hit the ball from different angles and from different parts of the screen. You advance through levels by destroying bricks and enemies, going up until the level boss enemy appears.</p>",

Barney's task is to find the children and the presents they have hidden.</p>\n<p>Barney travels across four different levels. On each one there are five children and five presents to find. You can only jump in the game when there are higher platforms to access. Despite being a platformer, this is not an action game, since Barney can't die and there is no quick reaction required to complete the game. The game is designed for little children and has a very low difficulty level.</p>",

Once a sufficient amount of enemies has been eliminated, the player is automatically transferred to the next fixed screen.

        "description": "<p>The game is based on the Disney TV series of the same name. Bonkers is a bob-cat police officer. One day, he reads in a newspaper that a contest for the best policeman is announced. Since his partner is away, Bonkers decides that would be the best opportunity to grab the first prize. In order to win the contest, Bonkers has to catch four famous criminals.</p>\n<p>Catching each one of the criminals is a separate mini-game. The first one involves you running horizontally in a museum room and throwing doughnuts at thieves who are trying to steal valuable things. In the second one, you try to lock a criminal in a yard by quickly building a brick wall around him. In the third one, you must find clothes hidden in crates before a bomb explodes. Finally, the fourth and last game involves you driving a car from top-down view, chasing a criminal. Each mini-game also features a unique bonus game, which you get when you successfully complete three games with gradually advancing difficulty in a row.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In this game, you play the role of the Crystal Pony. One day, her pony friends decide to make a party in a nearby castle. But an evil witch has captured and imprisoned all the ponies. The only pony who is still free is Crystal Pony. She must now carefully explore the surroundings, find gems that are scattered in various places, and use them in places where the ponies are captured to release them.</p>\n<p>You navigate your pony through various locations, collecting horseshoes on your way and \"paying\" them at level gates to pass to another location. You can explore the locations in any order you wish, traveling directly between them or using teleportation pictures. The game has more adventure than action elements. Crystal Pony cannot die in the game; if an enemy hits her, she merely loses one of her horseshoes. The only battles are against the witch, occurring every time you use a gem at the correct place. The pony would automatically jump over obstacles, but you can also make her jump with a corresponding button. You can get extra items by interacting with various objects and characters, pressing the action button.</p>",

For some reason, the only ones who can stop the invasion are the three Dinosaurs for Hire: Archie, a tyrannosaurus rex and their leader; the triceratops Lorenzo, lover of fine food, fine wine, and fine clothes, and the one-eyed, unpredictable stegosaurus Reese. Each dino has its own strengths and weaknesses. You guide the dinosaur of your choice through the platform levels of the game. You are equipped with a gun: tons of enemies will attack you from all the sides, so your best bet will be walking with the fire button pressed down. You can shoot to all the directions and also engage in melee combat when the enemy is too close. Each level has a boss enemy waiting for you in the end. There is also a cooperative two-player mode.</p>",

The car setup can be modified before you take to the track</p>\n<p>There is a Time Attack mode, allowing you to go for as fast a laptime as possible on any of the game's 20 circuits (which include the 16 tracks of the 1992 Formula 1 season), as well as a full season mode, with qualifying and the race itself. Weather can be customised in the Time Attack mode but is randomly chosen in Grand Prix mode, while you can only choose one of the D-tier teams (the 4 weakest of the 16) in grand Prix mode, but can drive for McLaren, Williams et al in Time Attack.</p>",

There are four different track sequences on offer, and your aim is to complete each section of track within the time limit.

From the main entrance, you can enter different movie sets with distinct areas such as graveyards, manors or the jungle. Using a side-scrolling view, Pink Panther can jump, duck, run, climb and use a boxing glove to knock out enemies.

        "description": "<p>Mutant League Hockey is a violent hockey game in the same series as Mutant League Football.  There are 23 bizarre hockey teams to choose from, with players consisting of zombies, skeletons, trolls, and robots.  The arenas are equally strange, with hidden bottomless pits, mines placed under the ice, spikes, and a \"Demon Net\" that functions as a goalie by chomping up and down and devouring the puck.\nThe game plays similar to normal hockey, except in this game your players can pick up chainsaws, maces, axes, etc. to use against the competition.  It's a bloody game, with opponents exploding into piles of goo (or circuits if they are a robot) when they become too injured.  The player can call special plays, like an exploding puck or jail break and attack the goalie.  The game also has fighting sequences if two players decide to get into a brawl.<br>\nThe game comes with multiplayer and a playoff series, full stats for your players and instant replays.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Beggar Prince</em> (Xin Qigai Wangzi) is a Chinese-made RPG loosely based on the famous novel by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/222334/mark-twain/\">Mark Twain</a>, <em>Prince and the Pauper</em>. A young prince is bored with the life in the palace, and one day manages to go outside the gate, distracting the guards. In the town he meets a young boy who looks very similar to him. The prince offers him to switch their clothes, because he wants to spend the day as an ordinary boy. But when he comes back to the palace, the guards don't recognize him in his beggar's clothes and refuse to let him in. A new life, full of danger and adventures, begins for the young prince...</p>\n<p>The game is conceived in the tradition of Japanese RPGs. You navigate the prince on the world map and around towns, fighting random enemies and descending into dungeons. The battles are turn-based and are viewed from an isometric perspective. You can attack physically or use a variety of magic spells, classified in types. In the beginning of you turn you have a full SP bar; each action reduces it, and when it is depleted, your turn ends. You can for example heal, cast magic, and physically attack different enemies during the same turn. Your enemies utilize the same system and can unleash multiple attacks on you.</p>",

Up to 4 players (using Sega's four-player adapter) can choose again from Thor the Warrior, Thyra the Valkyrie, Merlin the Wizard and Questor the Elf, each with their own advantages and disadvantages.</p>\n<p>Alongside the standard Arcade mode, there are the Quest, Battle and Record modes.  </p>\n<p><strong>Quest mode:</strong> The goal is to defeat the four towers and solve the mystery of the ancient castle. There is a main hub area where it's possible to choose which tower to take on next, buy weapons from merchants with collected gold, and increase stats by spending experience points.  </p>\n<p><strong>Battle mode:</strong> Players can fight each other to the death. Maps can include teleporters, monsters, items, and other things, as well as exits that exclude anyone who take them from the current round.  </p>\n<p><strong>Record mode:</strong> This is very much like the Arcade mode, with some variations such as a password continue, and a scoring system where players can't die but lose points for every 500 health lost instead.  </p>",

The theme is reflected in the vehicles (helicopters, speedboats, tanks, supply trucks...), as well as in the music.</p>\n<p>Up to 16 players can participate through the hot-seat party mode, but 8 racers can race simultaneously using the J-Cart and by sharing a part of the joypad. There are different game types, such as regular races (challenges), time trials, and battle arenas, in which you have to survive for a set amount of time while enemy vehicles charge.

        "description": "<p><em>Red Zone</em> is a helicopter action shooter in which you pilot an AH-64B Apache into the heart of enemy territory to thwart the plans of a nuclear armed dictator. Under threat of global nuclear war the dictator has begun to annex his neighbor countries, with plans to continue his territorial expansion, so three special operatives are covertly sent in with a lone gunship to remove his ability to wage war.</p>\n<p>The majority of the game consists of air-to-ground attack while flying in the Apache, using its hefty loadout of rockets, guided missiles, built-in 30 mm cannon and defensive infrared air-to-air missiles in order to eliminate the hostiles from the air, land and sea. Fuel drums, repair kits and ammunition depletion are both factors to keep in mind, and careful planning of where the pickups are located so that the chopper is able to stay in the air and is able to keep fighting, elements that are very similar in implementation to the Strike series. Differences between the games include the fact that as your systems get damaged, your helicopter becomes harder to control and the weapon and radar systems become affected.</p>\n<p>Interspersed with the plentiful in-chopper combat, there are numerous mission-oriented sequences in which the occupants of the helicopter disembark and perform missions on-foot inside of buildings. Each of the three characters have a unique set of weapons, and the player can choose from either of the three to use, so long as none of them have been killed during previous on-foot missions.</p>\n<p><em>Red Zone</em> bears many gameplay similarities to the early entries of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Electronic+Arts+Strike+Series\">Strike series</a> of games, though while the first three games of that series had a fixed isometric point-of-view, <em>Red Zone</em> has a straight-down POV that rotates along with the helicopter. <em>Red Zone</em> is also highly reminiscent of Zyrinx's earlier and similarly technologically advanced Genesis game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/14235/sub-terrania/\">Sub-Terrania</a>, with the most notable similarities being in the relative difficulty of the games, and in the manipulation of the Genesis' hardware into providing visual effects not seen in other games, such as simulated video.</p>",

In addition to the 20-team league that names the game and the State of Origin, a competition between two selections of players from New South Wales and Queensland, an European League (composed by twelve teams) and international playoffs (eight) are also available. It is possible to play friendlies, or jump straight to the club competition playoffs.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is simple, and focus on quick passing and running rather than kicking to gain distance. The A button controls kicks the ball (tackles in defense), B passes (or changes players) and C rushes and breaks tackles. There are a few additional tricks, such as pressing A+B to perform a short, lobbed kick or A+C to clear the ball from the defense. Kicking from a dead ball situation uses a three-click method. The first sets the bar in motion, the second the strength, and the third the accuracy. The stronger the shot, the less accurate it will be, and the initial position of the kicker also affects the direction of the ball. Each button represents a different ball height, from A (which is the lowest) to C (highest). Weather also affects how the game is played, as high temperatures with hard grounds make longer games tougher on the players (slowing them down) and cold, wet weather makes passing the ball more difficult.</p>",

Play against a friend or against the computer.</p>\n<p>Both on the offensive end as well as on the defensive end there are 24 predefined plays for you to choose from (you can't create your own). If you don't know which play is appropriate you can always choose \"Joe's Play\" - a hint for inexperienced coaches. The nature of the gameplay is very \"arcade-like\". The game doesn't have GM functions, players statistics, player attributes, substitutions or any other coaching options. Just choose your scheme and execute it.</p>\n<p>On the defensive side you can control any player you want, on the attack you control either the quarterback, a receiver, a running back or the kicker.</p>\n<p>The game doesn't have a NFL license, so you'll play against Detroit or Chicago instead of the Detroit Lions &amp; the Chicago Bears. Joe Montana is the only NFL player (actually he's the only one with a name).</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the film of the same name, this game puts you in John Rambo's shoes as he travels to Afghanistan to free Colonel Trautman from the Soviets.</p>\n<p>In six missions, Rambo must complete various objectives. Besides finding the exit of the level, prisoners must be freed and enemy ammunition supplies destroyed. Rambo is controlled from an overhead perspective and has several weapons at his disposal. Besides a machine gun that never runs out of ammo, he can use a knife for close range kills, set off timed bombs and use his famous crossbow with explosive arrows. Ammunition for the bow and the bombs is limited and can be collected from dead enemies.</p>\n<p>After some of the missions, the perspective switches to a view behind Rambo and additional boss fights take place. Soviet tanks or helicopters must be destroyed using the crossbow. While aiming the bow, Rambo cannot move, but otherwise he can hide behind rocks or other obstacles from enemy fire.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Europe-only sequel to <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8761/pete-sampras-tennis/\">Pete Sampras Tennis</a></em>, <em>Pete Sampras Tennis '96</em> includes new features, such as a reworked graphics engine with parallax scrolling, new shots and aftertouch controls, with an Indoor court joins the previously available Grass, Clay and Hard courts. </p>\n<p>Changes to the game go well beyond the graphics - now the ball reacts differently in each court and it's harder to control the direction of the ball, meaning the powerful forehands that could win a game in minutes of the first game are much harder to pull. Services now must be perfectly weighted in both power, direction and timing, facing the risk of hitting the net or going off bounds, with a speedometer showing how fast the best serves went. All these are controlled using the three buttons of the gamepad and the d-pad, with the A button for lobbing the ball, B to make passing shots and C to dive for a direction. By combining the B and A or C buttons it's possible to add top/back or full spin to the ball, with the Y axis changing the power and the X axis the direction. </p>\n<p>The large roster of <em>Pete Sampras Tennis</em> was replaced by only eight players: Pete Sampras himself, Sam Nimitz (German, powerful player best suited for hard courts), Marie Guyennot (French, accurate and fast around the court), Minori Hurosawa (Japanese, fast and agile all around), Dino Turnetti (Italian, with an aggressive style of play), Wanda Tucker (American, all around), Esperanza Delgado (Spanish, powerful serve and volleying abilities) and Richard Potter (English, rookie all-arounder). There are three game modes to square things up - Challenge (single match, pairs or doubles on any court), Tournament (\"Party mode\" for up to eight players) and World Tour (single player mode, where the player squares against seven computer players, with the option to play singles or doubles. There's a Pro mode which extend the match to three sets and increase the difficulty setting by enhancing computer player AI and allowing them to perform spin shots).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>X-Perts</em> is a spin-off of the <em>Eternal Champions</em> series. The game's plot is based on an alternate timeline, in which the assassin Shadow Yamoto, wasn't killed by the Black Orchid in 1993. She formed an anti-corruption group, the X-Perts, in revenge for an attempt on her life. Meanwhile, a group of terrorists took over an underwater research lab called AQUA, threatening to detonate a device that will destroy the entire Earth...</p>\n<p>In this side-scrolling fighting action game, the player controls Shadow and two companions, switching between them. Each character can execute unique fighting moves, and possesses specific skills. The game is set entirely in the lab; the player uses a special RECOM screen to monitor the placement of characters across the separate areas of the lab, as well as all mission objectives, enemies, facility robots, and other hazards.</p>\n<p>Beside fighting enemies, the player is also able to activate tasks for mission objectives. The time it takes to complete a task is based on the strength of the characters' engineering or computer science skills. Some secondary missions allow character upgrades to their personal weapons.</p>\n<p>Characters can also use the so-called \"torture moves\", unique for each character, to get information from the enemies instead of killing them. This would sometimes be needed for mission objectives. However, if not executed properly, it would instantly kill the enemy instead. </p>\n<p>When the player leaves a character to activate another, he would still continue to perform his task until it was attacked by enemies, and would automatically defend itself, but to a lesser extent than if directly controlled by the player.</p>\n<p>The game is broken down into chapters (save points). and each chapter remembers the status of the entire lab environment (enemies, flooded areas, broken power grids, hacked computers, and active force fields.)</p>",

        "description": "<p>Featuring in a children's TV cartoon, <em>The Hurricanes</em> are the most revered team in the World Soccer League. The Gorgons are desperate to beat them in a key match - so desperate that they have made it hard for the team to even get to the stadium. Taking control of one of their star players, you must trek through the jungle, mines and a temple to get them to the stadium on time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/529/soccer-kid/\">Soccer Kid</a> seems like a logical game to 'influence' a license of a show about brilliant football players. Arc Developments agreed. The gameplay thus has a football used as a weapon against encroaching foes. There are ropes to move across, precise jumps to time, and traps to avoid.</p>\n<p>In <em>The Hurricanes</em> the ball sticks closely to the player's foot, even while he is jumping. It is only released when purposefully kicked, and replaced if it hits something or is lost. It can be flicked up while you are off the ground.</p>\n<p>The levels move from left to right but on several different vertical levels, and there is often more than 1 possible path, in a manner similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Global+Gladiators\">Global Gladiators</a>. Power-up tokens can be collected and traded in. Losing one of your 5 lives takes you back to the last restart point - losing one of your continues takes you to the start of the world.</p>",

She can also cast spells and use special items. To do so, you must select it (in the inventory screen, brought by the <strong>START</strong> button) and choose a slot (right or left one). After selecting the slot, to cast the spell or use the item, you must press <strong>A</strong> and the slot direction (<strong>right</strong> or <strong>left</strong>).</p>\n<p>As in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Turma+da+M%C3%B4nica+Licensees\">previous Turma da M\u00f4nica games</a>, M\u00f4nica will get gold from killing her enemies, allowing her to buy items and new equipment. She can buy armor, shields, boots and stuffed rabbits. Some rabbits wont allow her to wield shields (in <em>Wonder Boy in Monster World</em>, it was due the kind of weapon, swords - one handed - and spears - two handed), but she will be able to spin her rabbit in order to cover herself.</p>\n<p>She will also encounter many of her gang friends, such as Cebolinha, Anjinho and Magali, for instance. She will also be aided by some travel companions, such as a fairy and the dog Bidu. Each travel companion will help her in a different way, attacking enemies, giving her items, breaking walls, etc.</p>\n<p>The game features a one slot battery backed RAM save, available at the inns throughout the game.

        "description": "<p>General Chaos is an arcade-style squad RTS where the player controls a team of five soldiers in a limited battleground, in a classic Red (General Havoc, headquarters in Viceria) vs Blue (General Chaos, in Moronica) all out war. The goal of the game is to push the frontline to the enemy headquarters, by winning individual battles and then beat them in their own capital.</p>\n<p>There are five kinds of soldiers, each with their weapon of choice and range of attack: the Gunner (machine gun, medium range and wide arc), Launcher (rocket launcher, long range), Chucker (grenades that can be thrown over barricades), Scorcher (flame-thrower, close combat) and Blaster (dynamite sticks, close range). Before each battle, players can choose the composition of their team from one out of four choices: Assault team, Brute Force, Commandos (a team of just two soldiers which have different controls) and Demolition.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is simple to learn, with the A button being used to fire at the nearest enemy, B to move to a the pointer location and C to cycle through soldiers. Using the commando team changes the controls, with the directional pad controlling a soldier directly, with B being used to call the other soldier nearby. While basic commands are simple, the player must deal with things such as distance from target and angle of attack to succeed.\nIf two opposing soldiers face-off during battle, they engage in a brawl (indicated by a cloud of dust). When that happens, the battle stops and the players are in direct control of the soldiers: A punches, B kicks and C blocks. Every downed soldier can can be rescued if there are enough medics available, earned at the end of each battle depending on how well the player did. </p>\n<p>Up to four players can play, cooperatively or against each other.</p>",

        "description": "<p>While cleaning up Acme Looniversity, Buster discovers a map leading to a secret treasure! But Montana Max swipes the map, and goes after the treasure himself. He also gets Dr. Gene Splicer to brainwash most of Buster's friends, and kidnaps the rest of them! Buster has to reclaim his map, his treasure, and save everyone while he's at it!</p>\n<p>Buster's Hidden Treasure is a platform game starring Buster and many other Tiny Toons characters. As Buster, players run through each level, jumping on enemies to defeat them. Buster can also pick up carrots - for every fifty he collects, he gets a helper friend which can be used to destroy all enemies on the screen. Although Buster only starts the game with three hearts, his health meter can be increased by collecting bells.</p>\n<p>The goal of each level is to find Gogo Dodo, who will let Buster exit the level. Similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Super+Mario+World\">Super Mario World</a>, Buster's Hidden Treasure has a world map that you can select your level from. Also similar to Mario World, some levels contain hidden exits, creating shortcuts, or granting players access to tougher levels.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on the character developed by Belgian cartoon artist Franquin, this platform features the player controlling Marsupilami, a strange animal with a large tail, who was poached along with Bonelli the Elephant from the Palombian jungle by Bring M. Backalive and sold to a Circus. Seizing the opportunity when the animal trainer fell asleep, Marsupilami got the key using his long tail and released all animals, and with the help of their Palombian friends No\u00e9, Bip and Sarah tries to return to Palombia.</p>\n<p>While it might seem a typical platform game at first sight, it includes a twist: Instead of dozens of enemies, Marsupilami has to guide Bonelli through gaps and other obstacles (not much different than the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/2927/earthworm-jim/\">Earthworm Jim</a> levels where Jim has to steer Peter Puppy to safety), by shaping his tail intro stairs, bridges or an umbrella, but to do so, he must first collect an icon with the abilities required to complete the level, up to four on each. Always available is the ability to shape into a giant fist not only to swat guards and other enemies away, but also to change Bonelli's direction. The player also collects fruits along the way, which not only provide extra points at the end of the level, but can be dropped out to slow down Bonelli. Each level is timed, so the player can't make many mistakes, even if some time bonus items are occasionally available.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In this quasi-sequel of <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Wimbledon+Championshio+Tennis\">Wimbledon</a></em>, Sega secured the ATP license, bringing 32 players (including Pete Sampras, John McEnroe and Stefan Edberg) plus a few others from the Senior Tour (among six others, legends such as Ilie Nastase and Stan Smith), as well as the option to create four players that can be developed in the ATP Tour mode. Each player has seven attributes that define their control and power in both serve, forehand and backhand, as well as their footwork. Four court types are available which affect the speed and bounce of the ball in different ways, and 11 real ATP tournaments are available to play.</p>\n<p>There are three game modes: Exhibition match, Exhibition Tournament (where the player competes in a 32-player tournament), ATP Senior Tour Event (where the player chooses one of the retired players and competes in a 8-player tournament) and the ATP Tour, where it's possible to create a player and develop his skills by winning (or simply doing well) on tournaments, with one extra point on each round won.</p>\n<p>Gameplay uses a simple 3-button layout, where the A button lobs the ball, B performs a controlled passing shot and C allows the fastest top spin shots, with the directional pad affecting the direction and depth of the shot.</p>",

Game modes include exhibition, tour and tournament for both singles and doubles.</p>\n<p>Along the usual offering of lobs, volleys, passing shots, top spins and slashes, the player can leave player movement to the console, and just focus on hitting the ball with the right shot with the correct timing (the player can also set the playing style, from all-court, baseline, or rush net). For those needing a boost of confidence before entering competitive play, Vic Braden, one of the most well known tennis coaches, has a court with special lines, a ball machine and some hints to help them improve their play.</p>",

In addition to moving and shooting, the ship has Power Claws that can be rotated and extended for offensive and defensive purposes. Power Claws can be equipped up to two units and can shoot bullets. The Laser is forward firing only but is rapid and strong, missiles can shoot back and forth and when shot from the Power Claw they will home in on enemies. Fireballs shoot in the opposite direction of your ships travel. The upgradeable weapons are Laser, Missile, Fireball, and Power Claw.</p>\n<p>Unlike most other games, the ship has variable speed, which comes in handy when maneuvering different kinds of obstacles and enemies.</p>",

Spell books, stars, crystal balls, potions and dinosaur eggs help him along the way. Enemies are dispatched by bouncing on them or casting small or large spells. If Mickey finds a wooden door he is led to a bonus area where he can collect many magical items.</p>\n<p>At the end of each level, Mickey takes the notes he's found back to the orchestra's conductor who will send him back into the world to keep searching if he hasn't found enough of them or gained enough points.</p>",

These involve destroying hazards, shooting enemies, moving across suspended poles, and jumping onto ledges. </p>\n<p>You have four energy and four power units - more can be collected up to a limit of 8, and they will always be recharged to four (if necessary) when you reach a boss.

        "description": "<p>Players guide Lt. Mike Harrigan as he tracks the Predator through seven levels based on the film. Mike's primary concerns are the hostages held around the levels, and the legions of gang members out for blood. He also has to contend with the Predator, both as a boss at the end of each level, and as a time limit - if the player takes too long to rescue a hostage, the Predator will blast the hostage with his tri-laser.</p>\n<p>The game is played in a third-person isometric view, with great swarms of easily-killed bad guys, who appear through one-way doors scattered throughout the level. Weapons not only include faster machine guns and shotguns, but also a few highly-advanced Predator weapons the player can pick up and use. Each defeated gang member drops drugs that can be picked up and automatically sent off to the \"drug squad\" for points. No sounds or music from the film get used, but stills scenes from the film do introduce the levels.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dahna: Megami Tanj\u014d</em> (Dahna: Birth of a Goddess) is a beat'em up with some RPG elements. The player controls Dahna as she scrolls horizontally or vertically through the levels. Dahna fights her enemies using a sword, and she can jump in two heights, duck and crawl. Dahna has also a magic meter, which has several colored levels. Different levels of her magic will produce different magical effects (as in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/199/golden-axe/\">Golden Axe</a>). Her magic can be replenished by gathering magical orbs, dropped by enemy mages when killed. They will also drop health orbs as well.</p>\n<p>She starts the game \"riding\" a giant, and in other portions of the game, she'll also ride other creatures, such as a horse and a griffin. When riding a creature, Dahna can't use her magic powers.</p>\n<p>As she kills enemies and gather orbs, Dahna gains experience points, which grant her level upgrades. Leveling up affects only her health, as she gains more health points.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Shove It! The Warehouse Game</em> is a top-down puzzle game based on the original gameplay of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1715/soko-ban/\">Soko-Ban</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/257256/hiroyuki-imabayashi/\">Hiroyuki Imabayashi</a> wrote for <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Thinking+Rabbit\">Thinking Rabbit</a>. The player controls Stevedore, a warehouse keeper, from a top-down view. As shown on the title screen, shoving boxes will earn him money to make his dreams come true, a lovely girlfriend and a fiery red sports car.</p>\n<p>The game consists of 16 stages with 10 rounds each. At a certain stage, any of the 10 rounds can be selected while playing but a new stage will only be opened up when all rounds have been successfully completed. To complete a round, Stevedore needs to push all boxes on the designated spots. This will turn them into a different colour. This is no easy task as the level design will obstruct many moves and cornered boxes can no longer be moved. While playing it is possible to restart the round, undo the last step and the game keeps track of the number of steps taken.</p>\n<p>The game supports passwords and includes an edit mode where new levels can be designed and played.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Muhammad Ali Heavyweight Boxing</em>, as the name implies, is a boxing game featuring the three-time World Heavyweight Champion. The game display 2D sprite-drawn boxers in a 3D ring (the so-called \"FreeCam\" 3D system), with the boxers moving around the ring in 360\u00b0.</p>\n<p>One or two players can choose the number of rounds (up to 15), the round length (up to 5 minutes), the number of times a fighter must be taken down to be T.K.O. and the number of referee counts (up to 10). There are two game modes: exhibition (which can be played against the computer or one-on-one by two players) and the tournament mode (single player). Players can choose among nine fictional fighters plus <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Muhammad+Ali\">Muhammad Ali</a> himself.</p>\n<p>There are two control types: arcade and simulation. In the arcade mode, the d-pad moves the boxer around, while the A button is used for jabs, the B button for defense and the C button for hard punches. In this mode, the game decides which of the boxer's arms will be used for each punch. In the simulation mode, the d-pad moves the player around. By holding the A button (for the left arm) or C button (for the right arm), the player can perform head jabs (by pressing up in the D pad), body jabs (by pressing down), body hooks (by pressing left) and body hooks (by pressing right). Holding the B button, the player can cover up (by pressing up), duck (by pressing down), sway left (by pressing left) and sway right (by pressing right). By pressing A and B together, the boxer performs an uppercut.</p>\n<p>Each fighter has a power and a speed bar. As they get tired by fighting or get hurt, the bars decrease. The lower the bars, the slower or weaker the punches get, until the boxer is knocked down. By defending himself a boxer can regain power or speed. There's also a counter of punches landed at each side of the screen. If the fight ends with no winner, the judges decision is made by those numbers alone, regardless of how many times the fighters were taken down during the fight.</p>\n<p>The game features digitized speech, including samples of Ali's voice.</p>",

Their likeness and real fighting style are simulated by the game.</p>\n<p>The game is an enhanced version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=010086012156\">Evander Holyfield's \"Real Deal\" Boxing</a>, being also played in a pseudo-3D side view with moving around the ring handled by scrolling the backdrop and moving the ropes. This time, a 2.5D camera is shown at the top of the screen.</p>\n<p>There are three game modes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Exhibition: one or two players can fight a single match.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tournament: one player chooses among the eight heavyweight champs available in a eight-man tournament against the remaining seven.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Career: one player creates a character who starts as the #30 of the ranking, fighting his way up against fictional characters. During character creation, players can choose the fighter's color of skin (which now includes some unnatural colors such as green and blue), trunks and hair, haircut, size of body and stats emphasis (power, speed and stamina). Between matches, career mode offers various exercises to assign the boxer to improve his stats. After reaching the #1 in the ranking, the player will be challenged by each one of the eight greatest heavyweight champions.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During the fights, besides an energy bar, the fighters have a head and a torso damage meter. This meters are images of their head and torso, which become gradually grey, from top to bottom, as they are hit. If one of these meters becomes totally grey, it will start blinking, warning that it the fighter takes some more punches on that area, he will loose the fight by TKO. Being knocked down tree times in a round also leads to a TKO. During the rounds' breaks, fighters regain strength as the girl with the round sign passes along their sides.</p>\n<p>Fighters can perform three types of punches: jabs, hooks and uppers, which can be aimed at the opponent's head or torso. Fighters can also taunt their opponents. Each one of the heavyweight champions has his own set of personal taunts. If by some reason the fighters avoid to fight, the spectators will start to hiss at them. To keep the spectators pleased, the fighters must keep punching each other on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>The game plays sensibly faster than <em>Evander Holyfield's</em>, and the character animation is more detailed. There's a replay feature included, and the fights are announced by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/97653/michael-buffer/\">Michael Buffer</a>'s voice.</p>",

The gameplay is fundamentally the same and has the player blasting invading aliens from Duke's point of view. This version consists of nine levels based on the PC's <em>Lunar Apocalypse</em> episode and a range of enemies and weapons from the original game. The difficulty has been raised significantly, and the framerate is noticeably reduced. The port also makes heavy use of scanlines and a smaller window size to reduce the overall render load.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Evander Holyfield's \"Real Deal\" Boxing</em> is a boxing simulation. <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/63557/evander-holyfield/\">Holyfield</a> is the only licensed boxer, the rest are fictitious. Rather than a fanciful approach like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Punch-Out\">Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!</a>, the developers went for a more strategic simulation. The game is played from a pseudo-3D side view with moving around the ring handled by scrolling the backdrop and moving the ropes. A top down camera is shown at the top of the screen.</p>\n<p>Players can either play a quick exhibition match or fight their way through the career mode, using a created boxer to work their way up the 30-boxer ranking list until they fight Holyfield himself. During character creation, players can choose the fighter's color of skin, trunks and hair, haircut, dominant hand and stats emphasis. Between matches, career mode offers various exercises to assign the boxer to improve his stats.</p>\n<p>During the fights, besides an energy bar, the fighters have a head and a torso damage meter. This meters are images of their head and torso, which become gradually grey, from top to bottom, as they are hit. If one of these meters becomes totally grey, it will start blinking, warning that it the fighter takes some more punches on that area, he will loose the fight by TKO. Being knocked down tree times in a round also leads to a TKO. During the rounds' breaks, fighters regain strength as the girl with the round sign passes along their sides.</p>\n<p>Fighters can perform three types of punches: jabs, hooks and uppers, which can be aimed at the opponent's head or torso. Fighters can also taunt their opponents. If by some reason the fighters avoid to fight, the spectators will start to hiss at them. To keep the spectators pleased, the fighters must keep punching each other on a regular basis.</p>",

By holding down the B button, Batman will block projectile-based attacks. He can also use his double jump (pressing the C button a second time while ascending) to leap greater distances or attack his enemies. To reach higher platforms, Batman can use his Grappling Hook (by pressing up and C to shoot, C again to climb). While piloting the Batmobile or the Batwing, Batman can shoot the Twin Vulcan Cannons (B button) or Twin Homing Missiles (A button).</p>\n<p>Through the levels, Batman will collect Batman emblems (which will give him Batarangs or Twin Homing Missiles, depending on the stage played), Hearts (which give him health) and Batman heads (which give him an extra life).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Roar of the Beast</em> is the second Genesis game based on the <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> animated film, only this time the player does not control Belle but Beast throughout the entire game. It is not a sequel to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6745/disneys-beauty-and-the-beast-belles-quest/\">first game</a>, as both games were released in the same year. This title largely retells the story from Beast's perspective. It starts with Beast living in a castle in the dark woods with his servants (Lumiere, Cogsworth and Mrs. Potts). A powerful storm hits the castle and enchants all animals around it. Initially the beast needs to protect the magic rose against the creatures. Soon, Belle and her father Maurice become involved, and eventually the villagers who invade the castle.</p>\n<p>The game takes place in Beast's castle and the surrounding woods. Through side-scrolling platform gameplay Beast can attack from three different stances (crouch, stand up, jump) and unleash a limited amount of roars that stun enemies for a short time. After regular levels, a sequence with a boss follows. There are also a few mini-games where Beast needs to finish a puzzle and catch rosebuds. Certain events are time limited. The game keeps track of the player's score, based on defeated enemies and collected treasures. There is an unlimited amount of continues and the story is told through static, drawn cut-scenes between missions.</p>",

He has to battle to death and defeat the other nine superpowers' contestants to regain control.</p>\n<p><em>Death Duel</em> is a tactical side-scrolling first-person shooter. The game consists of different time-limited rounds against a single enemy. Before each game, the player can spend Pheelae (money) on repairs and determine what weapons to take into battle. Each opponent has specific weaknesses and they can hide behind walls on the battlefield. To take them out, Jade needs to choose the most effective weapons and target specific parts before he runs out of time and ammo. Weapons include missiles, rockets, grenades that slow the opponent down, a machine gun and more. Only three weapons can be acquired at all times. Between missions there are short gallery shooting mini-games where additional money can be acquired.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A terrorist organization led by a fanatic operating out of the Middle East has brought together a military force capable of holding the entire world hostage, backed by a lot of evil governments. The player needs to board a F-119 stealth fighter and stay undetected while taking out all opposition.</p>\n<p>Although technically boarding a stealth fighter, no stealth elements are involved. After choosing one from the different locations on the map, the player is shown flying from a first-person cockpit perspective and enemies do not seem to have trouble locating the player's aircraft. In different solo missions the player needs to take out all opposition using regular bullets and lock-on missiles. All statistics, including the remaining time before running out of fuel and the enemies on the radar, are shown in the cockpit HUD. The craft is able to move left and right, and use a boost to do sideways rolls or complete loops to get behind enemies. Some shots can be taken, leading to body damage, but incoming missiles are usually fatal and those need to be shot or avoided. Next to regular enemies, there are also a few boss planes. Missions take place all over the world during different times of day.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Menacer 6-Game Cartridge</em> was released as a pack-in cartridge for the Menacer light gun. It is a compilation of six games:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Pest Control</em>: in this game the player has to defend a pizza from the attack of assorted bugs. The player smokes the bugs while controlling a spotlight, but it is also possible to see the whole table while pressing a second button (in this case, it won't be possible to use the insecticide). The game is over when the pizza is all eaten. Different bugs will appear throughout the levels, such as some big ones which explode in smaller ones when shot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Space Station Defender</em>: the player has to shoot aliens inside pods which appear on the screen in a given sequence and in specific positions. As the player follows the pattern, he has to reload the weapon by aiming the lower end of the screen where \"power\" can be read. There's also a random mode, where all pods appear at the same time and the player has to guess the order in which they'll open. The aliens shoot back if the player takes much time to shoot them. Once in a while a little flying saucer will cross the screen; shooting it will give the player a shield point. The game is over when player's life is depleted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Ready, Aim, Tomatoes!</em>: this game is set in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7247/toejam-earl/\">Toejam &amp; Earl</a>'s universe. As the screen scrolls right, Toejam has to shoot tomatoes at enemies such as the Cupid, the Dentist, the Boogie Man, the little Devil and so on. There are also special items to shoot, like bombs which will kill all enemies at the screen or tomato baskets which will give ammunition. For each level there's a target score to achieve. In advanced levels the enemies will shoot back. The game is over when Toejam's life is depleted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Whack Ball</em>: this is some sort of a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Breakout\">Breakout</a> game. The player controls a paddle and has to bounce a ball against a frame of blocks. Once a block is touched by the ball, its color is changed, and the objective is to change all blocks colors. Some glowing blocks have special effects when hit like sticking the ball to the paddle, giving an extra ball or shrinking the paddle. A time limit is given to each level, and if the player doesn't succeed, another chance is given. The game is over when all balls are lost though the holes in the frame.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Front Line</em>: in this game the player has to shoot tanks, trucks, planes and helicopters before they shoot back. There are two weapons available: a cannon with unlimited ammo and 10 missiles per stage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Rockman's Zone</em>: in this game the player has to shoot cardboard pictures of bandits while avoiding shooting pictures of women, children and policemen. Bonus points are given for accuracy.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the shooting games the player can choose to have the Accu-Sight on or off. If it is on, a crosshair will be displayed. If it's off, the player can also choose to use the Menacer's Binocular Module.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The game situates itself on the \"Isla Sorna\" sites of Jurassic Park, a concept originally based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/9189/steven-spielberg/\">Steven Spielberg</a> series of movies. You play the role of a bounty hunter trying to catch some prized dinosaurs. This game is not a side scrolling platform game like the other two <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/12750/jurassic-park/\">Jurassic Park</a> games on the Genesis. This is a top-down view game like the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=SNS-J8-USA\">SNES version</a> of Jurassic Park, with gameplay similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=The+Chaos+Engine\">The Chaos Engine</a>.</p>\n<p>Each of the four Isla Sorna sites contains three missions. Once you have completed the three missions you unlock the boss mission. For a change in the game, the boss missions are 3D look-alike levels. Once the four sites are cleared you get two more final missions to complete the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Socket</em> is a fast-paced platform game in the vein of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Sonic+the+Hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>. The evil overlord Time Dominator has constructed a time machine and is using it to steal treasures from the past, creating a warp in the flow of time. The Time Warp Patrol, created to prevent this sort of thing from happening, sends the special time-traveling duck Socket (or Minutes in the Japanese version) to fix the flow of time and stop Time Dominator.</p>\n<p>Socket has reasonably basic abilities: he can jump, kick to the side or straight upward, and run quite fast. As Socket is a robot, his energy level continually drains from simply being in operation; thankfully, there are a liberal amount of electric bolts strewn about each stage, which will refill his health when picked up. Getting hit by enemies will take a chunk out of his life bar.</p>\n<p>There are seven different themed zones, each with four separate parts. First up is the High Speed Zone, which is a gateway level leading to the next zone, and as the name suggests it encourages high speed play. Next is the Athletic Zone, which generally entails lots of jumping, and the Labyrinth Zone, which is focused on exploration and simply finding a path to the exit. At the end of each Labyrinth Zone, Socket faces off against Time Dominator in a boss round, then moves on to the next High Speed Zone.</p>\n<p>The game also features a sound test mode and a time trial mode, where the High Speed Zone stages can be played without any enemies present with times being recorded.</p>",

Limitations have been imposed on character creation as well: there are only four character classes (Warrior, Rocketjock, Medic, and Rogue) and three races (Human, Desert Runner, and Tinker) to choose from, as opposed to five character classes and six races in the computer release.</p>\n<p>You play as a party of new recruits to the organisation NEO which is fighting the RAM faction, a group of tyrants who previously ruled the solar system. The game begins with you preventing an invasion of earth headquarters by alien mutants. After this you transit to an orbital command base where you take on several different missions.</p>\n<p>In the computer version, first-person view and pseudo-3D graphics were used for navigation, while combat was viewed from isometric perspective. In this release, isometric view is used both for navigation and combat, the player-controlled party visible from third-person perspective.</p>",

Ashura, the King of an alien race hailing from the Evil World, decides that this is the perfect time to strike the vulnerable unprotected Earth.  It just so happens that one of the good gods, Hyperion, takes pity on the humans and decides to bestow his power to four of the strongest Earth warriors so they can go and defeat Ashura and his minions.</p>\n<p>The player takes control of these four warriors who are Leo, a fencer, Marco, a monk, and Horatio and Tiffany, whom are both ninjas (one male, one female). Each character fires their own type of weapon and each character can charge up their weapon to make it a more powerful shot. All the characters also have a special weapon that can clear all the enemies on the screen but with the caveat that it can only be used once per stage. Each character also has a jump and speed attribute which when powered up allows them to jump higher and walk faster. Players can switch between all of the characters during a stage.</p>\n<p>The game has 9 different stages. The player can play the first six (mountain,harbor,street,future,glen, and forest) in any order. Each round ends with a boss which must be defeated to clear that round.</p>",

The peaceful island, Usont\u014d, has been split into seven pieces, and it's up to our hero, Hat, and his friends to restore the island and defeat the evil king!</p>\n<p>Based on the 1989 TV anime <em>Magical Hat</em>, produced by Studio Pierrot and based on the original manga by Y\u014dji Katakura, <em>Magical Hat no Buttobi Turbo! Daib\u014dken</em> (Magical Hat's Flying Turbo! Adventure) is an action platform game not unlike the Master System classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9002/psycho-fox/\">Psycho Fox</a>. You play as the titular Hat, jumping on and punching enemies, grabbing items from statues, and fighting a boss at the end of each world. In each stage, you can find your robot-egg friend Robegg hidden somewhere, who will help you out by acting as a projectile and a shield.</p>\n<p>There are a wide range of different power-up items that can be obtained in the game, which will do things like give you temporary invincibility, freeze all the enemies for a short time, give you an extra-high jump, or even call in air support from a helicopter. At the end of each stage, you can play a game of chance to win extra items and lives.</p>\n<p>A heavily modified version of the game was released outside of Japan as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7272/decapattack/\">DEcapAttack</a>. The graphics, sound, story, and many of the stages were changed.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Genesis title based on <em>Batman Returns</em> is a platform game in which the Dark Knight must traverse five action-filled levels on his way to confront the Penguin.</p>\n<p>Areas include the rooftops of Gotham City, Max Shreck's department store, the Red Triangle Circus and the sewers. Besides run-and-jump action, there's also a lot of combat in the game, as many of the Penguin's henchmen stand in Batman's way. He can knock them out with punches and kicks and a number of extra weapons stored in his utility belt. These include batarangs, which come in standard and self-seeking varieties, and smoke bombs that stun enemies for a while. In addition, Batman can shoot from his grappling gun and unleash a deadly swarm of bats towards enemies. All of these weapons have limited ammo, however, that must be collected.</p>\n<p>Other special tools Batman can use include the grappling hook to reach high places or swing across chasms, and his cape, which can be used to slow falls.</p>\n<p>Each of the five levels features several boss battles against Catwoman, the Penguin and others.</p>",

Now with that out of the way, this is a soccer game with training, exhibition, and tournament modes.</p>\n<p>Training lets the players team practice without an opposing team on the field. Exhibition is the basic one team versus another for one game. The tournament mode is divided into two different modes; 8 Nations and World Cup. 8 Nations is just a shorter version of the World Cup tournament mode because it involves only 8 teams instead of all 32 of them like it does in the World Cup mode.</p>\n<p>The player can choose to play as one of these 32 International teams or can choose to create their own team that has its own shirt, stripe, and shorts colors.</p>\n<p>The game has options that allow the player to choose to have light or heavy wind, a dry, soggy, or snowy field, and to have fouls turned on or off.</p>",

In <em>Season</em>, the player competes in an 18 game season in order to compete for the championship.</p>\n<p>There is also a two-player mode, but with a different set-up than other soccer games. Instead of letting two-players face each other, they must instead play a tournament in a series of one-player matches in order for their teams to face off. The game features realistic rules and regulations and genuine animations including bicycle kicks, headers, traps and dives and features a competitive artificial intelligence unique to each team.</p>",

One day, however, a giant black ship appears in the sky, and aliens come down to the surface and start attacking the dinosaurs. Feeling their suffering, the dinosaurs' creator, The Egg, awakens. To protect their race and their planet, the dinosaurs must fight the invading aliens, and force them to leave Planet Jura.</p>\n<p><em>Dyna Brothers 2</em> is a real-time strategy game comparable to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/613/populous/\">Populous</a>, and the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/57543/dyna-brothers/\">Dyna Brothers</a>. The player controls their small army of dinosaurs against the invading enemy alien army. There are six types of units compared to the original game's five, each of which has different skills and proficiencies. The player can order their dinosaurs to move or attack, and can also hatch new dinosaurs from The Egg. There are also environmental commands like earthquakes and lightning strikes.</p>\n<p>Like the original game, there is a full scenario mode included. New to this sequel, however, are a practice mode, a free battle mode, and a two-player mode where the second player takes control of the alien invaders.</p>",

To accomplish this task the player must diffuse bombs by walking over self-destruct switches while avoiding getting hit by enemies. The player can jump on tiles and trampolines in order to distance himself from any incoming enemies, although trampolines can only be jumped on a few times before they rip and become a hole that the player can fall down and die in. The player can also pick up a limited number of P-Balls in each stage and use them to eliminate enemies.</p>",

Each stage is made up of multiple areas; falling into holes in the ground leads to underground passages, and jumping onto flying shells leads up into the clouds.

Blocks rise from the bottom of a well, and the player must slide them around in order to create a row or column of three same-color blocks. This causes the group to clear, and potentially create chains from the blocks above falling. As the game continues, the number of blocks that must be cleared to continue as well as the speed at which the stack rises will both increase.</p>\n<p>The game includes three modes. First is training mode which explains the basics of the game. In this mode, a certain number of blocks must be cleared to complete the stage. Second is a \"pin-up\" mode for one player, where clearing blocks reveals parts of an image of a cute anime girl, the goal being to uncover the entire picture. Last is a two-player versus mode, where players compete to clear their blocks the fastest, and can send garbage blocks to their opponent and fill up their field. The game includes two difficulty settings, two versus modes, a sound test, and a unique mode that displays the entire game in sepia tone.</p>",

You can also opt to watch the computer control both teams. The game also allows for simplified play per player, as well as shorter games with as few as three innings.</p>",

While the basic concept remains the same, the game features all-new graphics, streamlined controls, changes to the tech tree as well as completely new levels.</p>\n<p>As in the original game, the player controls the troops of one of three noble Houses, called by the Emperor to mine the Spice Melange on the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune. A series of consecutive battles must be won by mining spice, constructing a base and building units to attack the enemy.</p>\n<p>The rather complex menu-based controls of the original game have been replaced by a context-sensitive cursor system, where a unit reacts according to what is below the cursor - either moving to a destination or attacking an enemy unit, for example.</p>\n<p>The tech tree has been simplified: Among other changes, concrete slabs are only available in the 2x2 size, there is only one type of vehicle factory and the advanced units do not require an IX research center anymore.</p>\n<p>Finally, the progression of levels in the console version is strictly linear, as there is no choice of the next map to be played as in the original version.</p>",

Each mode can be played against either the computer or a friend, and there are three different lane types available. There is also a practice mode for each of the game types.</p>\n<p>The Japanese version, <em>Boogie Woogie Bowling</em>, is largely the same but features different, more anime-style characters to play as (including a robot for no explained reason), as well as minor tweaks to the timing for throws.</p>",

Each \"race\" is made up of two heats of two parts each, and hits or kills on the other team earns points. During each heat, each team takes one turn attacking (four vehicles on the course) and one turn defending (three vehicles on the course). The team with the most points at the end of the last heat wins a reward and moves on to the next match.</p>\n<p>However, your team won't get very far with just its basic equipment. After choosing your team's colors and members, you must then purchase upgrades for each person: engines, fuel, AI, armor, and of course weapons. During the game, you can switch freely between each member of your team. Your vehicle automatically moves forward around the track, but you can turn, throttle, and brake in order to move closer to or escape from the other team.</p>\n<p>After each successful match there is a game of chance where winnings can be increased. There is also a two-player simultaneous battle mode.</p>",

However, also included on the cartridge is a completely new sequel with all-new stages, bosses, graphics, and music. The basic gameplay is identical: a vertically-scrolling shooter where power-ups cycle through a list to choose from, and it is possible to construct massively-wide ships with incredible firepower. <em>Slap Fight MD</em> also adds the ability to jettison your ship's power-ups causing a massive screen-filling explosion that can potentially save your life.</p>",

However, these kids are very serious about their dodgeball, and the road ahead isn't going to be easy for Danpei.</p>\n<p><em>Dodge Danpei</em> is a team dodgeball game, one of several based on the anime and manga created by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/540016/tetsuhiro-koshita/\">Tetsuhiro Koshita</a>, which plays strikingly similar to the well-known <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Super+Dodge+Ball\">Super Dodge Ball</a>. Each team has four main players and three support players, and attempts to knock out the opposing team's main members by throwing the ball at them in various ways. Apart from normal throws, the player can also pass to teammates, and execute special power throws which are harder to dodge or catch.</p>\n<p>The game includes several different game modes, including the main story mode which follows the story of the anime, as well as one- and two-player exhibition matches. There is also a \"league\" mode which allows for a tournament of up to six teams, as well as a training mode where the game teaches the basics of how to play the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Trouble Shooters, Mania \u014ctorii and Maria Haneda, are a pair of bounty hunters who will take any job that involves lots of trouble and plenty of shooting. Their last job saw them saving the Crown Prince Denka from the evil military mastermind Don Morguestein, presumably ending his evil plans. However, three days later, Morguestein has returned once more to take revenge upon the Trouble Shooters. Mania and Maria, never wanting to miss out on the action, head off to take care of him once and for all.</p>\n<p><em>Battle Mania Daiginj\u014d</em> is a comical anime-themed scrolling shooter, and the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/28893/trouble-shooter/\">Trouble Shooter</a>. The player controls the <em>Dirty Pair</em>-esque Mania and Maria simultaneously, with Maria following closely behind Mania, and also able to turn around and fire to the rear. Unlike most shooters, Mania has a health meter which can be replenished via pickups. There are a variety of weapons to choose from at the start of each stage, and during the game, weapons can be powered up. There is also a screen-clearing bomb attack, but it must be allowed to charge back up each time it is used.</p>\n<p>The game includes a standard single-player mode with three difficulty settings. There is also a score attack mode which challenges the player to earn the most points possible in two minutes on a set stage.</p>",

On his way back to his home planet, daydreaming about girls, Divine's computer picks up a transmission from a nearby planet. Answering the transmission, it turns out to be a distress call from a beautiful woman on the Water Planet. \"Save me...\" she pleads, \"and I will lend you my power.\" Falchion, lonely bachelor in space that he is, can't say no to a pretty face, and flies off towards the Water Planet.</p>\n<p><em>Divine Sealing</em> is a basic vertically-scrolling shooter with adult content. The player controls the spaceship Divine, and shoots a variety of enemies. There are no bombs or powerups, but every 10,000 points the player is awarded with an extra life and a firepower upgrade. A boss appears at the end of each stage which must be destroyed. After defeating a boss, the player will meet up with one of four girls, who are then shown in various states of undress as Falchion \"borrows their power\".</p>",

They have developed the experimental warfighter TU-190, which has enough firepower to threaten the entire free world, and it's headed for the United States. The UN sends in a lone fighter, Falcon, who must break through the enemy lines, destroy TU-190, and save the free world from destruction. Commence operation!</p>\n<p><em>Task Force Harrier EX</em> is a vertically-scrolling shooter based on the 1989 arcade title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/90340/task-force-harrier/\">Task Force Harrier</a>; from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=UPL\">UPL</a>. The player controls the titular Harrier V fighter plane, which fires both air and ground volleys -- necessary to hit the targets that approach from both the air and the ground, like in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/11460/xevious/\">Xevious</a>. The player can collect various power-ups to increase their firepower, including smart bombs, weapon upgrades, and most notably a pair of invulnerable satellites which can change formation at command. There are three difficulty settings and a total of twelve stages to blast through.</p>",

Apple's only method of attack is throwing enormous 16 ton weights (thus the title), which can and will crush enemies in a bloody mess. However, these weights will bounce off each other, so the player must be careful to not let Apple get crushed himself. They are also not entirely unlimited, as the player can only hold five at once, and they must be allowed to recharge when Apple runs out. Enemies on each stage will appear from the top of the screen in waves, through a randomly cycling \"slots\" meter, and once all slots and enemies have been cleared, the player moves on to the next stage.</p>",

There are numerous hazards that the player must watch out for, including moving platforms, solid iron blocks, blocks that will break as soon as the egg touches them, moving spikes, and tubes through which only the penguin or the egg can pass.</p>\n<p>The player can also find special items to help out; hearts will increase the bonus score, wings let the penguin jump higher, and iron eggs let the egg fall further without breaking. There are a total of 30 puzzles to solve, with a password given every five stages.

The player directs their robotic marble around the field, attempting to push their opponents into the deadly electrified walls lining the arena. Aiding in this is a jet booster, which can cause opponents to bounce quite far, but if overused will overheat and must cool down before being used again. There are ten different arenas, each with different hazards like oil slicks and moving barriers. There is a single player mode, where the goal is to destroy all enemies to move on, as well as a two-player versus mode where the goal is to destroy the other player.</p>",

Each stage contains blocks, treasure boxes, and an exit which is blocked by a ghost. The explorer can kick and destroy the blocks as well as carry them, and can also move through small openings by carrying blocks into them. However, if he falls even one square downward, the block will crush him and the stage must be restarted. He must collect the contents of each box in order -- the last contains an item which will dispel the ghost -- and reach the exit without either trapping or crushing himself with the blocks.</p>\n<p>After clearing each stage, a time bonus is awarded, and an extra life is earned for every 3000 points. Every five stages, the player receives a password with which to resume play, and is also allowed to skip two stages. There are a total of 35 puzzles to solve.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Pyramid Magic III</em> is the final title in the <em>Pyramid Magic</em> series of puzzle adventure games, and picks up right where <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/44499/pyramid-magic-ii/\">the second game</a> left off. Our hero is still inside of the same pyramid, but is finally nearing the treasure he seeks! Unfortunately, it would appear that the final step requires a large, heavy, fragile jug filled with some kind of liquid. He must now find a way to take this jug to where his treasure awaits.</p>\n<p>While the basic concept remains the same, the game is made more difficult by the addition of the jug. The jug is fragile: if it is kicked or dropped any distance, it will break and the stage must be restarted. However, it is also dangerous: much like the stone blocks, if the explorer falls even one square while carrying it, he will be crushed by its weight. In each puzzle, the player must collect all of the keys to open the door, but he must also reach the door while carrying the jug with him in order to proceed. There are a total of 30 puzzles to solve, and once again the player is allowed to \"pass\" twice.</p>",

Just like always, the player is cast as an explorer seeking a hidden treasure, who must make his way through each room, collecting all the keys, without either trapping or crushing himself in the process. This installment offers another 35 puzzles to solve. These new puzzles are exceptionally challenging, designed for those who found the other titles too easy, and the player is even given three passes instead of the usual two.</p>",

One or two players choose from four different drivers, each with their own special ability, then head out for a race on one of four different tracks. Of course, the goal is to be the first to finish three laps of the course, but watch out for your opponents; bump into them or the terrain and your vehicle will take damage. Take too much damage and it's game over! After each race, winnings can be used to upgrade or repair the vehicle. There are three difficulty levels, which affect how quickly the vehicle takes damage. There is also a practice mode where the player can freely choose any track.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ball Jacks</em> is a competitive action game taking place in the distant future. Two robot crabs, piloted by men seeking fame and fortune, face opposite each other in an arena. Behind them is a conveyor belt with large metal balls rotating around. The goal is to capture the opponent's balls and hold them until their timer runs out. Each crab has two claws which operate independently; they can be used to grab balls from the opposite side of the screen, as well as to knock them out of the opponent's grip. The player must also be careful, as taking a hit from behind will damage the crab, and if it takes too much damage then the crab must return to the pit area to be repaired.</p>\n<p>There are several game modes included. The main focus is the World Championship mode, in which one player takes on a succession of increasingly skilled computer opponents. Also available is a two-player versus mode with a number of handicap options. There is also a training mode where the player can freely practice to get a feel for the controls, as well as a time trial mode where the goal is to grab as many balls as possible within the time limit.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Tel-Tel Stadium</em> is a baseball game with generic Japanese teams. The main draw of this particular version is online play through a phone line, but this service has long since been discontinued. Unlike many baseball games, <em>Tel-Tel Stadium</em> takes a rather hands-off approach to the action, allowing the player to give commands to the batter, pitcher, and fielders rather than directly controlling them. In addition to the now-defunct online mode, it can be played single-player offline with an exhibition match, as well as a \"pennant mode\" where the player builds their own team and plays through a full season. There is also the option to watch a computer-controlled match.</p>",

The player's only control over the ball is choosing the direction and power of the shot, and they must get the ball into the cup within par. Each of the 18 holes contains bizarre hazards like bumpers, lava pits, moving walls, and ice. For each stroke over par, the player loses one ball; if all balls are lost, the game is over. However, the player can regain balls by shooting under par.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Sonic Eraser</em> is a puzzle game very similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7685/columns/\">Columns</a> that features Sega mascot Sonic the Hedgehog. Pieces in different arrangements drop into a well; if two or more matching pieces touch, they disappear and the above pieces fall to take their place. There are four different single-player game modes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Round</strong>: Each stage starts with pieces in the well already. There are several spinning green pieces, which must all be destroyed to finish the stage.</li>\n<li><strong>Normal</strong>: A standard endless mode in which the game speed continually rises as matches are made.</li>\n<li><strong>Doubt</strong>: No white-colored blocks will appear in the drop formations, but often a random block in the formation will change to a white block after it is placed.</li>\n<li><strong>Block</strong>: Similar to Normal mode, but blocks will not fall out of formation until a match is made, allowing for impressive clear combos.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These modes can be played either single player or two-player simultaneous on separate fields. There is also a versus mode for one or two players, in which creating a combo of three or more clears will attack the opposing player, which causes them to lose control of their pieces for a short time.</p>",

He has designs on world domination, and has plans to use the power of golf toward this end; this is the Battle Golfer project. Yui Mizuhara and Ran Ryuzaki are two ordinary high school girls who just so happen to be golf prodigies, and so are prime candidates for the Battle Golfer project. They are abducted by Professor G, but are rescued by a mysterious man before they can be taken under his control. Having escaped, Yui hears about a golf tournament being held by the Hazard Foundation, and suspecting more nefarious plans, she secretly enters the tournament to stop him for good.</p>\n<p><em>Battle Golfer Yui</em> is a unique genre fusion between a golf game and a Japanese-style adventure game. The main adventure mode casts the player as Yui competing in the Hazard Cup tournament. The player can interact with other characters on the course, and will need to defeat several different opponents at match play on oddly-themed courses in order to proceed. The system is quite simple and fast-paced; simply choose a direction, a club, spin, and hit the bar with the right timing to adjust shot power. Each character also has special abilities to help them out, but these are limited in use. There is also a regular golf mode for one or two players, offered as both stroke and match play.</p>",

This version is one of the first to feature a full campaign mode, and takes place during World War II with the player commanding the German Nazi army, starting with the invasion of Poland in 1939. Depending upon the outcome of each battle, different paths might be taken that can diverge wildly from historical fact.</p>\n<p>The game plays out on the hexagonal grid that the series is known for. As always, each space on the grid is a specific type of terrain, be it grass, mountains, or sea; different types of units like infantry and tanks can be moved about the spaces and attack each other. Different types of units have different strengths and weaknesses toward each other, which is also affected by the terrain. The ultimate goal is to capture all of the opposing cities.</p>\n<p>In addition to the scenario mode, there is also a \"standard\" mode where any map in the game can be freely played with any combination of human and computer players.</p>",

The game takes place on a board made up of various spaces: there are spaces which increase or decrease the character's money or happiness, spaces where the player can spend their money to buy things to increase their happiness, and spaces that trigger various events. The game ends when the goal has been reached a set number of times, and the winner is the player with the most happiness at the end of the game. Up to four players can play, with the computer taking control of any remaining characters.</p>",

Grab a mallet and bash heads in until you can get her back, that's what! <em>Mallet Legend's Whac-A-Critter</em> is based on the classic coin-operated redemption game <em>Whac-A-Mole</em>. Each stage has nine holes, out of which various creatures appear. The player must hit as many of the \"bad\" creatures as possible, while leaving the princess and the dog untouched. Some creatures wear helmets and must be hit several times to be defeated. Between each stage, there are minigames where bonus points can be earned, and there are six stages total. Also supported is a special nine-button \"Smash Controller\" specific to this game.</p>",

Like most any scrolling shooter, the player must shoot down various enemies without allowing the ship to be hit and destroyed, and there is a large boss waiting at the end of each stage. The ship has two different modes of fire, which will shoot in different directions; if three power-ups are collected, the number of bullets fired will increase. There are three difficulty settings available.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Counting Cafe</em> is an educational game based on the popular children's show <em>Sesame Street</em>. The player controls Grover, working as a waiter at a restaurant, where Mr. Johnson appears and orders various items. The player must take Grover into the kitchen, collect the items ordered, and return to Mr. Johnson's table, where he will reward the player with a star if the order is correct. If the player picks up the wrong items, they can be taken to Cookie Monster at the back of the restaurant, who will eat them and clear Grover's tray.</p>\n<p>There are five sections to each \"day\" -- Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch, Dinner, and Dessert. Once the player has completed Dessert, a monkey will run by and snatch the last star. Grover then must chase after the monkey to retrieve his last star, after which the game will move on to the next day.</p>\n<p>After the first day, Sesame Street denizens will start appearing in the kitchen playing around with food items. Sometimes their activities with a food item will end up landing on Grover's tray, which may result in Grover carrying an unwanted food item, forcing him to give the food to Cookie Monster and having to collect the correct food items all over again.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Continuing the R.B.I. series, the 1993 entry updates the rosters, adding two new teams (Colorado and Florida), bringing the total to 28 teams, and nearly 700 players. Instead of a generic stadium, all 28 teams have their own ballparks modeled after the real deal. On top of the regular team vs team mode (in either a single game, best of 7, you vs the division, or you vs the entire league), you can spend time in a home run derby or fielding practice. Also includes rosters of every division champ from 1984 onwards for Game Breaker mode.</p>\n<p>Play is either player vs computer, as either the home or visiting team, two players, or computer vs computer. Password saves allowing resuming the multi-game modes. Included is the ability to edit the teams; you can transfer players between teams to keep the rosters current, or just have some fun. Finally, the Game Breaker mode allows setting up a game in progress using any team, any inning, any score.</p>",

The player has several weapons that can be freely switched (forward shot, back shot, and missile), and can also change the speed of the ship. Enemies come from all directions, and certain waves will drop powerups, including shields and weapon upgrades. The player needs to collect five upgrades in order to improve their weaponry, but the upgrade affects all three weapons.</p>\n<p>The game includes eight stages, most of which include both a midboss and a boss at the end, and three difficulty settings. There is also a minigame similar to <em>Whack-a-Mole</em> where there is a grid of ship icons, and the player must hit the rotating ships.</p>",

This particular game covers Rudolf Steiner, a soldier of the Motavian government. One day, while preparing to head home from the military base he was stationed at, Rudolph sees a large amount of smoke appearing over his home town. Worried about his wife and child, Rudolph rushes off to his hometown to see what the problem is.</p>\n<p>Gameplay consists of exploring various locations, looking around them to find other characters to converse with in order to gain clues, and searching for items to take in order to use them to solve problems which helps further the plot. </p>\n<p>Some items that can be picked up can be used for weapons during combat. When in combat, the players weapon's attack power is multiplied by a random dice roll to figure out the strength of the attack. The same rule applies to the enemy combatant's attack. The goal of combat is to drain all the enemy's HP.</p>",

The game loosely follows the plot of the movie, with Ivan Ooze being the main villain. The player can choose between six Rangers, the main difference being in their color, strength, movement speed and special attacks. At some points Rangers use colossal assault vehicles known as \u201cZords\u201d to fight bosses. The game features two-player simultaneous play. The game's soundtrack consists entirely of digitized versions of original music created for the TV show.</p>",

This particular game covers Nei, a half human, half bio-monster girl. She was found wandering around all alone and was then adopted by a middle aged couple. One day, a mob of villagers burned down Nei's adopted parents house with them inside it. Nei escapes and now she wanders around aimlessly through different villages, while being left with the terrible memories of the mob leader who ordered her house to be destroyed.</p>\n<p>Gameplay consists of exploring various locations, looking around them to find other characters to converse with in order to gain clues, and searching for items to take in order to use them to solve problems which helps further the plot. </p>\n<p>Some items that can be picked up can be used for weapons during combat. When in combat, the players weapon's attack power is multiplied by a random dice roll to figure out the strength of the attack. The same rule applies to the enemy combatant's attack. The goal of combat is to drain all the enemy's HP.</p>",

One of several games based on the license, the Genesis version features the same story as the other Sega versions, but has a unique design and set of levels.</p>\n<p>Inspired by a tale his father told, Taz goes on a quest for the egg of a giant prehistoric seabird, which will lead him across the whole of Taz-Mania through 16 levels of platforming action. He must survive a desert, a jungle, a car factory, a mine and ancient ruins. Taz is able to run, jump, and spin fast to turn into his trademark whirlwind. While spinning, he can knock out most enemies he comes across. He can also pick up many different items and try to eat them or use them in another way. Most foods replenish his health, while eating hot peppers gives him a fire breath attack. Stars grant temporal invulnerability, while bombs should be thrown at enemies (and definitely not be eaten!).</p>\n<p>Several levels feature boss fights. A break from standard platforming comes in the shape of a mine cart ride, where the cart must be raised or lowered to avoid collisions, and a wild river, which can only be crossed by jumping across fast-sinking tree logs, reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Frogger\">Frogger</a>.</p>",

In New York, Wolverine must make his way through the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club, an underground dungeon, and the NYC sewers for a final showdown. Lots of enemies stand in his way: flying robot drones, armed guards, The Hand ninjas and Inner Circle bodyguards, among others. He can take them out with basic jumps, kicks and slashes, as well as link the basic moves into more powerful combos. When Wolverine takes damage, his mutant healing factor kicks in, (slowly) regenerating his health. Health packs should be sought out, however, because just sitting around waiting for the health to recharge is not an option: a timer slowly ticks down to the appearance of the android girl Elsie Dee, designed to destroy Wolverine. Her embrace means instant death.</p>\n<p>Besides the basic enemies, many levels also includes a number of boss fights, some against faceless hardware like a giant robot or a helicopter, others against Wolverine's signature foes. These include classics like Sabretooth and Lady Deathstrike as well as many culled from early 1990s X-Men comics like Albert (an android replica of Wolverine), Cyber, Trevor Fitzroy and Shinobi Shaw. Information about all of the characters can be accessed from an in-game menu.</p>",

While the original let you play one of three different monsters to go through side-scrolling beat'em-up stages and fight (non-playable) monster as boss enemies, the Genesis version was re-worked into a one-on-one fighter similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9830/king-of-the-monsters/\">first King of the Monsters game</a>. </p>\n<p>Apart from Farmardy, all characters from the Neo Geo version are playable. To win, the player must defeat all other monsters and a clone of the played monster in a fight. The matches take place in areas built from the original levels, and feature destroyable landscapes and secondary enemies, both of which can be smashed to gain points and power-ups.</p>",

It is shown from a top-down perspective and all units are represented by icons on the square fields of the playing map. The basic gameplay is simple: on each of the four levels there are goals to fulfill, e.g. destroying pirate ships. To do so, the player chooses a unit and gives it the order to move somewhere. When hostile units meet, they fight automatically; the fights are shown in separate windows.</p>\n<p>Besides movement, there are also other orders to give to each individual unit, e.g. building a palisade, making a trap, the movement speed and, most importantly, the retreat options. Then a unit automatically flees when a fight does not work out and, after a rest, it regenerates to full strength.</p>",

The sailor told Kageha with his dying breath that his ship had been attacked by Nobunaga, and the ninja master took the child as his disciple, training him in the ways of the ninja, and giving him the name Burai.

The player takes turns with the computer, positioning individual units on the grid-based map, and attacking enemies.

Each stage has a specific goal and a strict time limit, measured in days. Short scenes between stages move the story forward.</p>",

In building their robot, the player must first distribute points to five different stats, and then may also purchase weapon and body parts. Once the setup is complete, it's off to battle.</p>\n<p>The player directly controls the robot in battle, moving it around the arena and attacking with its weapons (if any are equipped). Using the weapons will deplete the robot's energy, though direct contact between the two robots will damage both of them, and is a viable attack if the energy is depleted. If the player's robot is victorious, additional stat points and money are earned, and the player moves on to the next fight.</p>",

The joined forces of NATO and the Commonwealth of Soviet States are to stop General Hasouz who is seeking to gain control over the world's oil resources. You are the pilot of the Russian-built MiG-29 and you need to accomplish several strategic missions to ensure the success of the operation. </p>\n<p>As this is a simulation game, the MiG-29's control panel is recreated (displaying altimeter, compass, thrust indicator, radar and more), and many actions are done manually by the player (such as controlling brakes and landing gear, performing take off and landing, etc.). There are a number of weapons and an automatic targeting system to help successfully accomplish the missions. The MiG-29 is also equipped with flares and chaff used to avoid enemy fire. </p>\n<p>The game is divided into 5 missions plus a tutorial mission. Mission objectives include destroying the enemy's command control and communications systems, escorting a submarine to safety, and destroying enemy Scud missiles. Mission score is based on the number of enemy structures and craft destroyed.</p>\n<p>The game features real-time 3D polygon graphics and there are even several short video clips, something very uncommon for Genesis hardware.</p>",

Each side has multiple units, which can move depending upon the terrain. Conflicts between units are shown as animated sequences, and the player can determine formations, as well as issue and change orders to different troops at any time. Battles between enemy commanders take the form of a side-scrolling 1-on-1 action sword battle.</p>\n<p>There are two scenarios available. The first casts the player as Takauji Ashikaga as he attempts to oust Godaigo and establish a new government, while the second follows Masashige Kusunoki and Yoshisada Nitta, who must try to protect Emperor Godaigo and his imperial rule. The two scenarios intertwine at various points, and graphical story sequences between each battle drive the story.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>World Series Baseball 98</em> is the fourth Genesis game in the baseball series. This entry has the rosters and stats of the 1997 MLB season (including interleague play) as well as updated statistics for the 1996 season featured in the previous game. Once again all 28 teams are featured. The game types are identical to before: Exhibition, League, Playoffs, Batting Practice, Homerun Derby, and Classic Homerun Derby, along with All-Star games. Trading can be enabled or disabled. The gameplay and visuals are identical to the previous game. A new feature is that statistics are tracked through 27 categories and next to the overall progress in a league for instance, league leaders, team leaders, team statistics and team standings are saved to the cartridge battery.</p>\n<p>Batting is shown from a behind view with three options: contact, normal or power. The player has to time the swing to make contact. While pitching the three options are fastball, splitter and changeup (in the previous game slide was offered instead of changeup). In pitching mode a rectangle is shown to determine the position of the ball. It can also moved out of the rectangle to trick the batter into a wide one and the accuracy is determined through the batter's statistics. During gameplay fielding can be done manually or by the computer. Runners have the ability to go back, advance or slide. Various line-up and strategy options can also be altered during gameplay.</p>",

Multiplayer is supported for two players.</p>\n<p>At the kick off, during a scrimmage and whenever the ball goes over a side line, a meter appears to determine the power and curve. It is filled up automatically and the player has to press a button twice to time both aspects. While running with the ball, it can be passed along or kicked. In a defensive position it is possible to tackle and switch between players. Each player has individual statistics based on position, height, weight, speed, passing, rucking, tackling, tactics, kicking and injury. Fixtures for the world cup can be looked up on a separate screen.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Gunship</em> is the Mega Drive version of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=MicroProse\">MicroProse</a> helicopter series. Just like the original game the player gets to command a helicopter through a first-person perspective. Missions are preceded by a briefing and a planning stage. A map of the environment is shown from a top-down perspective with the starting position, enemy locations, fuel dumps, and the target. The player sets out custom waypoints to reach the target. Often a fuel refill is required to make it that far and it needs to be calculated in.</p>\n<p>During missions the helicopter can be steered in any direction, but it is not necessary to keep track of waypoint directions, as they are automatically followed. The HUD contains the remaining distance, health, fuel, score, and a radar with enemies as red dots. There is a certain amount of freedom of movement and a voice warns about incoming missiles. Helicopters can be shot with a cannon. At a fuel dump the helicopter becomes vulnerable and the player can choose to disengage before the refueling is complete.</p>\n<p>When the target is reached, an approach sequence is initiated. The game turns into a 2D 3rd-person side-scroller, unique to the series. There is freedom to move up and down and engage targets with the regular cannon or homing missiles in the air and on the ground. The helicopter can also turn 180 degrees to travel in the opposite direction. A yellow arrow marks the direction of the final target. In this sequence the player receives multiple lives (credits) to continue playing. In the first-person sequence death is final. These 2D sequences can be practiced as six scenario's in a simulator from the main menu.</p>",

In this fishing simulator players get to participate in a fishing tournament. Starting at 7.30 in the morning, the player has until 4PM to take a boat on the lake and fish for bass to beat competitors. The boat can be steered freely using a top-down view until an appropriate spot has been found by checking the lowrance monitor. The game then switches to a first-person view, also showing the fisher from a side-view on a separate part of the screen, and it is possible to look around in the environment.</p>\n<p>Casting is done using a power meter to determine the distance. As the bait sinks, a monitor can be checked for nearby fish. There are also visual clues through splashing water. The player can check the depth and reel in when needed. When a fish has been caught, it becomes a sensitive play with the line tension to make sure it does not snap shown through the side-view of the fisher. At the end of the day the boat can go back to the weighing area to determine the results. Money earned in the tournaments can be used to acquire new spin reels, bait reels, boats, lines and lures.</p>\n<p>Next to the tournament there is a music player and a free fishing mode. In the free fishing mode every option can be customized, such as six types of lakes, the starting time, the direction and the strength of the wind, overall weather and the temperature.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>TNN Outdoors Bass Tournament '96</em> is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=TNN+Bass+Tournament+of+Champions\">TNN Bass Tournament of Champions</a>. It shares many elements with the PC game of the same name, but that version has an isometric-style map and a full 3D view for the fishing sequences. Just like the original game it is a fishing simulator that allows the player to access a free fishing mode or to participate in a fishing tournament. First, equipment needs to be bought. It consists of lures, rods, reels, lines and boats. Better items can only be acquired by winning money in tournaments.</p>\n<p>After selecting the equipment the game takes the player to a top-down map where one of the six available lakes can be explored. The included lakes exist in real life. They are Lake Okeechobee, Truman Reservoir, Lake Erie West, Dale Hollow, Lake Eufaula, and Bull Shoals. Through a monitor an appropriate spot for fishing can be found. Once set, the game then switches to a 3rd-person over the shoulder view, similar to the earlier SNES version instead of the previous Genesis game. Casting is done through a power meter and it is possible to do bad casts that need to be retried. Once in the water the camera switches to a top-down view inside the water. Players can watch the bottom surface and fish swimming by. When reeling in one of five available speeds can be chosen and the bait can still be moved. The game starts at 7.30 in the morning and the boat needs to return in time to weigh the fish.</p>\n<p>In the free fishing mode various parameters can be defined such as the season, weather, starting time and wind strength. In a tournament these change dynamically. The game includes a music player for the soundtrack.</p>",

In order to proceed with the story, the player must defeat a variety of colorful opponents at mahjong. The actual mahjong play is largely traditional, though there are several special techniques the player can use to gain an advantage.</p>\n<p>In addition to the story mode, there is also a free battle mode, as well as a mahjong quiz mode and several options to change the rules of the game.</p>",

Shortly after the player joins up, a silent military coup attacks their headquarters, and the new recruit must work together with the other Division 2 members to stop it.</p>\n<p>The game is structured as a hybrid Japanese-style RPG/adventure game. The player moves and fights in a traditional RPG style, but entering certain locations switches the game to a command-adventure style where the player can ask characters about different subjects, investigate items of interest, and collect and use a wide variety of items. At first the player controls only the recruit, but other characters later join the player's party.</p>",

The player controls a number of individual units in each map, which can be directed in various ways, such as to approach and attack a particular target, construct or demolish structures, or form or disband units.</p>\n<p>The single-player scenario begins with Caesar receiving orders from Rome to suppress a revolt in Asia. There is also a free battle mode for one or two players that features several dozen maps to choose from. A unique feature of the game is the highly configurable menu system. The player can move, resize, rearrange, and close any of the different information windows as they see fit.</p>",

Game modes include Regular Games, Shootouts, Playoffs (in either single elimination or best-of-seven mode), and a full season. Creating and trading players is also supported.</p>\n<p>While the real NHL season was shortened due to a lockout, the game includes the originally planned 82-game schedule. In <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/265/nhl-95/\">NHL 95</a>, any scheduled game could be played. This has been changed in favor of the player picking their team and taking it through the entire season. A scheduled game can either be played or simulated, and the season can be ended at any time, skipping to the playoffs based on current league standings.</p>\n<p>Compared to previous entries, many more moves for players have been added, including give-and-gos, one-timers, the spin-o-rama, fake shots and drop passes. For the first time, the game has selectable difficulty levels, while fights between players make a return, having last been featured in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/11455/nhlpa-hockey-93/\">NHLPA 93</a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Genesis version of <em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</em> is a one-on-one fighting game based on the TV series, featuring two playing modes: one-player scenario mode and two-player battle mode.</p>\n<p>In scenario mode, the evil Rita Repulsa sends a number of her monsters (and the evil Green Ranger) after the Power Rangers, who must defeat each in one-to-one combat. Before every bout, players can select a different ranger to play. Each of the five matches consists of two rounds: after the first round, the monster usually changes form into a larger version of itself (the Green Ranger summons his Dragonzord instead), which the Power Rangers must then fight again using their Megazord mecha. After the Green Ranger is defeated, he also becomes available as a playable character for the remaining fights.</p>\n<p>In battle mode, players can select from the six rangers, four monsters and two Zords to fight each other in best-of-three matches in almost all combinations (the Zords and the Cyclopsis monster cannot be matched against any of the rangers, and both players cannot play the same character).</p>\n<p>Two of the controller's buttons are used for normal and fierce attacks, while blocking is done by either pulling back from the enemy for standard blocks or pushing both buttons simultaneously for a powerful block that reflects even enemy projectiles. Button combinations unleash different special moves for each character.</p>",

In seasons and playoffs, any game can be either played or simulated (with the exception of the Super Bowl, which must be played). Special modes are Custom League and Custom Tournament. A custom league can be set up between 4 to 10 players with freely selectable teams. Every team plays every other team once at home and once away. For 8 players and up, teams are divided into two divisions. The division champions face up in a final playoff. The custom tournament can be set up for 4, 8 and 16 players competing for the Madden Bowl in single elimination mode.</p>\n<p>Quarter length can be set from 5 to 15 minutes. Weather conditions can be set between fair, rain and snow. Further options are two skill levels (Pro and Madden), John Madden commentary, freely definable audibles, eight different penalties that can be set to different levels, player fatigue, injuries and substitutions. Play calling mode can be set to a bluff mode, offense and pass catching can be set to manual or automatic, and all-player mode allows one to control any player on offense, even those with no direct part in the play. Player records and season/playoff progress are saved via battery. Records are saved for each individual player, with eight slots available.</p>\n<p>The game also features custom rosters via player creation (stats are set via a number pool), trading and signing of free agents.</p>\n<p>Besides the custom leagues and tournaments, there is multiplayer support via the 4-Way-Play, allowing for any combination of team or versus play. One player always calls the plays and controls the quarterback, while others can select which player to control.</p>",

So, while not all challengers receive a trophy, they often make new friends in pursuit of one.</p>\n<p>Cascade is a puzzle game. Players maneuver dice around a grid, trying to form numerical combinations that may then be \"blasted\" to progress against the current opponent. Clearing combinations that include starred dice, and / or clearing multiple sets of combinations, speeds up the progression. Opponents are defeated when the player's energy plug rises to the top of the screen. A competitive two-player mode is also offered.</p>",

The player controls one of two adventurers sent to Egypt by the British Museum to collect a set of five royal mummies and all the treasure they can carry. Gameplay takes the form of a single-screen maze game, similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a>. Each floor of the dungeon has a grid of sarcophagi; the player must walk a full circle around a sarcophagus to open it, and must collect at least one key and one treasure before moving on to the next level. Unlike the original game, <em>Oh Mummy Genesis</em> features a slightly more involved story and each tomb is capped off with a boss battle.</p>\n<p>In addition to the remake, a faithful port of the original Amstrad CPC version of <em>Oh Mummy</em> is also included.</p>\n<p>After the initial print run sold out, the game's ROM was made available for free download from its official website.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Sumo Slam!</em> is a party game for up to twelve players with sumo wrestlers challenging each other on a platform. The game is played on a fixed-screen showing a platform with the sumo wrestlers using a top-down view. The wrestlers cannot be controlled directly. They constantly rotate in a stationary position at a fixed speed. By pressing and holding down a button the player makes the wrestler go forward in the direction he is facing for as long as the button is pressed. As soon as the button is released the wrestler starts rotating again. The game can be played in different game modes: Sushi (collect sushi playing along against a time limit), Chase (a game of tag) and Fight (bump other wrestlers off the platform). As only a single button or key press is used up to twelve players can participate simultaneously in local multiplayer. When playing alone the computer controls the opponents.</p>\n<p>The game is almost identical to the 2004 J2ME title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/130617/sumo-smash/\">Sumo Smash!</a>, which in turn is based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/130619/jumbo-rumble/\">Jumbo Rumble</a>, but it is not clear how the games are related.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mega Cheril Perils</em> is a 2D platform game based on the 2010 ZX Spectrum title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/130798/cheril-perils/\">Cheril Perils</a>. It keeps some elements of the original game as well as the premise, but both visually and for the gameplay there are many differences. The game stars the character Cheril. Wearing no clothes she leaves her homeland, the jungle of Badajoz, to start a life in the city. When she arrives there she discovers the city is overrun by zombies. A virus created by the pharmaceutic enterprise Parasol meant to make everyone beautiful was transported in a cistern truck not properly cleaned. The previous content was morapio double-malt and the mix of the two substances has an unusual side effect: it turns people into brain-eating zombies. Now the city has been shut down by the mayor using a barrier. The only way for Cheril to leave the city is by killing all zombies to clean the streets and convince the mayor the city is safe again.</p>\n<p>Cheril needs to navigate platforms and can only defeat zombies by jumping on top of them. These zombies take on many shapes also as animals and flying creatures. Instead of one level the game now consists of five separate stages with a password provided after completing the previous one to enter them directly. Each level consists of a series of single-screen rooms, linked together horizontally and vertically to offer exploration. The game shows how many zombies need to be defeated near the top of the screen and once they are all dead the level is completed automatically. Next to platform elements with moving sections sometimes she also needs to push barrels to create passages. Certain sections are blocked off by a dirty old man. He only lets Cheril pass when she gives him a piece of lingerie and those need to be located first. A single hit with an enemy or spikes immediately makes Cheril lose one of the nine lives she starts with. Sometimes hearts appear to provide an additional life.</p>\n<p>An entirely new element is that each room now contains a device that stop all enemies in their tracks for ten seconds. When Cheril activates it by jumping on top of it, the screen turns monochrome and a countdown is started. All enemies freeze, but platforms still move. When the countdown is over the colour returns and enemies start moving again. This is a core gameplay mechanic as enemies can now only be defeated when they are frozen. Jumping on top of them while they are moving makes Cheril lose a life. The freeze mechanic carries over between rooms, so a countdown started in one screen goes on in the next, leading to some environment based puzzle-solving.</p>\n<p>Next to the free download release there was a crowdfunded release with the game on a PAL/NTSC compatible cartridge along with a box and instructions. Based on the tier different extras were provided, such as having your name listed in the game and the manual, a Mojon Twins T-shirt or becoming a character in the game replacing Cheril as the protagonist.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mega Mindtris</em> is a falling block puzzle game for one or two players based on the concept of the earlier <em>Mindtris</em> mobile games. It is played on a field that consists of five columns. Single blocks drop down and they each contain a number based on the powers of two (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256). The goal is to create lines lining up five blocks that each contain the number that matches the block in the goal field. For instance: if the goal field contains the number 8, a line disappears when five blocks containing 8 are lined up next to each other horizontally. With each new line formed the goal changes.</p>\n<p>When a block is dropped on top of another and together they form a power of two vertically, the sum of blocks is added and only the bottom block remains with the total sum. For instance: if there is a column with the blocks 1, 2 and 4 on top of each other, dropping a 1 on them adds them all up to a single block containing 8. There are also multiplication blocks, for instance changing an 8 into a 16 by dropping a 2x on top of it.</p>\n<p>The game can be played with four difficulty levels forming two game modes. Alone is an endless game mode playing an infinite game without an opponent or power-uss. The other game mode comprises the difficulty levels easy, normal and stupid. There the game is played against a computer opponent. The game can also be played against a friend. When not playing alone a random power-up is provided with each line. They provide a bonus or hinder the other players. They can for instance provide 50 extra points, add lines, freeze or speed up the gameplay, invert horizontal movement, steal a power-up, blast blocks or change the field.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>SupraKillminds</em> is a fast-paced puzzle title based on the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Quartet\">Quartet</a>. The goal of the game is to assemble gems by fitting four pieces together. A piece with one of four available colours appears in the middle of the screen. The player has to sent it to one of the four quadrants using the four directions on the D-pad. Based on the form it automatically moves to the correct part of the quadrant. When a complete quadrant is formed, points are scored and the pieces disappear. More points are provided for creating gems completely of the same color, but this is not required. Even if all parts have a different color points are still awarded. When a gem is made and all quadrants are then empty, the largest amount of points is awarded (500) as well as an extra life.</p>\n<p>At the start of the game five lives are provided. A life is lost when a piece is accidentally sent to an occupied space or when time runs out before a move is made. Only a small amount of time is available to decide. For every 1,000 points the available time per move is decreased. It starts with two seconds per move.</p>\n<p>The game was released on two types of cartridges as a mail order release, but also as a free download.</p>",

The homebrew game was originally created for the 2015 bitbitJAM competition. On a single screen shown using a top-down view the bikes move forward at a fixed speed and can only be made to rotate 90 degrees left or right. They leave behind a trail in the same colour of the bike and have to avoid crashing into each other's vehicle or trail / wall.</p>\n<p>While lives are endless, points are scored while moving, so the player that keeps riding without crashing keeps gaining points. After three minutes the game ends and the player with the highest score wins. The game can also be played in single-player, with the option to go against two or four riders. When in multiplayer the four players use two gamepads: one player uses left and right to steer and the other the A and B buttons on the same gamepad.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Miniplanets</em> is a homebrew and open source arcade-like game. The player controls the character Qisha through around the globes of 3D planets that wrap around with platformer-centric gameplay. The game consists of five planelagos of nine miniplanets each, of which Qisha is the protector. Each planelago used to be guarded by one of his children, but one day they were turned into statues by an unknown force. Qisha needs to go through each planelago to retrieve crystals that bring back his children and banish the force.</p>\n<p>Qisha can be moved in eight directions and only a single button is used to jump. To complete a level he needs to reach a coloured area after first collecting all keys in the environment. Each planelago has a different theme. Challenges include avoiding deadly water, navigating past moving platforms, avoiding bombs and electricity, staying on conveyor belts etc.</p>\n<p>With the default game option only 60 seconds are provided to complete a miniplanet, but this setting can be changed. Qisha starts with five lives and an encounter with a hazard is deadly right away. Extra lives are provided for every 15,000 points, but this setting too can be changed. A password system is used with a password for each completed planelago. Points are scored by completing miniplanets quickly, as the remaining time is converted into points.</p>\n<p>The game received a cartridge release in 2017 courtesy of PlayOnRetro with a PVC box and reversible cover, translucent violet cartridge, full colour manual and a postcard.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Bomb on Basic City</em> is a homebrew Genesis game inspired by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Bomb+on+Pixel+City\">Bomb on Pixel City</a> titles. In ten zones the player controls a plane using a 2D side view and needs to bomb the buildings below. The background scrolls and wraps around, but the same applies to the plane when it reaches the right side of the screen and at a faster speed. With each pass the plane can only drop one bomb so it needs to be timed carefully to target a specific building or one of the enemies below firing at the plane. With every pass the plane also flies four pixels lower, providing less room to time the bomb and avoid enemy fire.</p>\n<p>The speed of the plane can be influenced by accelerating or braking, but it cannot be stopped entirely. Hits are rewarded with points, but also with bonuses that float upwards. They include a move bonus that allows the plane to fly up and down, the ability to launch three bombs at once and a buckler bonus that protects the plane against AA fire. A POW bonus is provided for every score and combo. When the POW meter is full a super bomb can be dropped.</p>\n<p>The game fits the developer <em>Papi</em> series of games so here the character controlling the game is Papi Commando. The <em>Bomb on Pixel City</em> games it draws its inspiration from reference the pixels of systems such as the Atari 2600. In this game this is changed as a humorous take on programming languages as Papi Commando needs to prevent Basic City (named after the Basic language) against the C++ invading force.</p>",

As a typical Choose-Your-Own-Adventure game most of the game consists of text with a few illustrations. At crucial points various options are presented to proceed, leading to different outcomes. The story tells about an adventurer magician who is on a quest to locate and confront the wizard Balthus Dire. To reach him a citadel needs to be navigated. He needs to avoid monsters and collect artefacts to gain access to the inner sanctum.</p>\n<p>At the start of the game a hero is created based on dice rolls determining ability, endurance, chance and magic points. Magic points can be divided over twelve categories such as fire, force, levitation, luck, protection, telepathy etc. Game options include automatic or custom hero creation, toggling the scenario text, text speed and font selection.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>T\u00e4nzer</em> is a homebrew action title inspired by games like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Strider\">Strider</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/75190/osman/\">OSman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/27065/hagane-the-final-conflict/\">Hagane: The Final Conflict</a>, the art of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/109634/keita-amemiya/\">Keita Amemiya</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/31298/roger-dean/\">Roger Dean</a>, and anime series like <em>Guyver</em>. The protagonist is a ballet dancer who is unexpectedly hit by a bright purple light at night in an apartment, just a week before the premiere of the ballet version of <em>The Ariane</em>. After the character wakes up the body is transformed and the world is in chaos. Each level has a different setting, ranging from the Old West to Ancient Rome. Levels are made up of several stages with mini bosses and then a large boss at the end of the level, acting as the guardian of that era.</p>\n<p>In this 2D side-scrolling platformer the character can freely run left or right, jump and crouch. The jumping height is affected by how long the button is held down and jumping again provides a double and then a triple jump. Expert jumping can lead to an infinite amount of jumps because when an enemy is attacked while in the air, the counter is decreased so an additional jump can be performed. Enemies are engaged using six way fire with horizontal, vertical and diagonal slashes, and the attack button can be held for auto fire. Levels contain treasure chests with more gold, extra energy and other items. By destroying parts of the scenery secret pick-up items and stages can be discovered.</p>\n<p>Defeated enemies leave behind gold that can be forged into a transmutation ability, allowing for special attacks. The top right side of the screen shows the selected ability and how much the meter needed to perform it contains. In the pause menu a different ability can be selected. Forging abilities is done at the home base between levels, a space and time ship used to travel between time periods. Energy can also be replenished there through body repair. There are four abilities and they can be upgraded to make them more effective. At the home base it is also possible to forge a projectile weapon and the ability to save (but only while the game is active, the save disappears when the console is turned off).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mega Marble World</em> is a homebrew Genesis game. It is a puzzle game that consists of 50 rooms where a ball needs to be guided to the exit. Using the four direction keys the ball can be moved in any direction and will automatically follow that path until an obstacle is encountered so the ball cannot be stopped halfway the trajectory. There are no enemies, but a lot of thinking is required to get the ball to reach the exit. There are bottomless pits and traps to take into account as well.</p>\n<p>Rather that separate levels, the entire game is shaped like a large dungeon maze where all room are connected on a large world map that can also be consulted. Often rooms have multiple exits and the easiest one is not always the best option to progress. Players also discover multiple paths, portal and secret corridors. The game keeps track of the elapsed time and the number of moves needed. Using a password system it is possible to continue at the last room. Some rooms are very small, but there are also huge ones where the camera zooms out at the start. The goal is to reach the exit of the dungeon in a fast time.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Racer</em> is a homebrew puzzle game inspired by one of the puzzles in the 1997 PC title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=5029988001316\">Safecracker</a>. One of the rooms in the mansion has an arcade machine where a puzzle needs to be solved after inserting a key card. The concept is based on a single screen with a street plan, a starting position for a car, a finish point and a trajectory between them. To solve the puzzle the player needs to use the handles at the bottom to steer the car left and right based on the displayed trajectory. The car does not move however so the entire sequence of turns needs to be completed just by following the path by mentally visualizing it.</p>\n<p>Initially created as an experiment with the 16-bit adventure/visual novel engine GINCS in 2007 the game was eventually finished in 2013 with eight levels based on the concept. Only two actions are used to move left and right. The game confirms if a turn is correct after each input. As soon as a mistake is made, the car crashes and the level needs to be restarted. A next level becomes a bit more difficult based on the number of turns. Some music is included as well. Between levels screenshots are shown from Genesis racing games.</p>\n<p>After the download release in 2013 the game received a cartridge run of 25 copies in 2004 and there was a second edition in 2019.</p>",

She inherited the business from her missing sister Sarah, but when she is about to close it she receives an anonymous call tasking her to locate a hidden forest outpost. The entire story is told through still images with 3D graphics. There are horror elements to the game and most of the interaction is based on a number of choices using a menu structure. These choices can lead to many different endings such as a normal one, a secret one and several that end with death. There is also a text-based dice fighting system and the developer encourages to play it with a real dice. When dead the game restarts from the last checkpoint. It includes an in-game encyclopedia to learn more about the characters. There is a PCM based soundtrack that sounds like the output of a Game Boy Advance title.</p>",

Their peaceful life is interrupted by the invasion of a group of poachers who take away several of his family members, so Joey sets out on a journey to bring them back.</p>\n<p><em>Outback Joey</em> is the only game released for the HeartBeat Personal Trainer, a Sega Genesis-based fitness system. Using a pulse sensor and game control pads mounted to an exercise bike, stairclimer, treadmill or ski machine, players have to exercise while playing an otherwise traditional 2D platformer. The player's heartbeat is directly tied to the player character's in-game speed, with a healthy heartbeat allowing him to move faster and a resting heartbeat slowing him down to a slog. Players can create a profile with their name, age, and gender, and their health data is tracked persistently over time to let them track their progress.</p>",

The game remains identical to its counterpart on other computer and console platforms. It is the fifth game in the popular turn-based strategy game series, based on the classic medieval Chinese novel \"San Guo\" (\"Three Kingdoms\"). Its events occur in the third century AD, during the Later Han Dynasty. Several army leaders (the most important ones being Liu Bei, Cao Cao, Sun Jian) are trying to unite China under their rule, and each one strives to defeat his opponents.</p>\n<p>The game offers many innovations. The player doesn't only participate in wars, but also manages their country, and learns resource management of people and goods. A \"Reputation\" parameter directly affects the people's opinion of the player as their leader. Multiplayer allows participation of up to eight players (playing the eight main characters).</p>",
