        "description": "<p>This BBC Micro version of <em>Revs</em> is the initial release of this Formula Three racing game. It only contains the Silverstone track. Players can do practice rounds on the track or participate in a championship, preceded by qualifying laps to determine the starting position. There are three difficulty levels to choose from and in the pits the front and rear wing settings can be changed.</p>\n<p>Controlling the car is more complex than contemporary titles, with different keys for the gears, one for the gas and additional one to accelerate. It is also a pure simulation, much in the spirit of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/6244/geoffrey-j-crammond/\">Geoff Crammond's</a> later <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=MicroProse/Crammond+Grand+Prix+series\">Grand Prix series</a>; every contact with another car or missing a corner almost immediately leads to a crash.</p>",

Using a scrolling isometric perspective, players need to guide a space ship through a course. It is filled with enemies such as stationary turrets, space ships and rockets launching from the ground. There are also many obstacles that need to be avoided. Instead of merely shooting anything that moves the player also needs to shoot fuel barrels to combat the dwindling fuel supply. The ship is also able to move up and down into the air. That way many hazards can be avoided, but it consumes a lot of fuel. Flying higher is often needed to move over walls and pass through narrow gates. When the game is completed it immediately restarts. The player has three lives.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Events in the rural village of Ambridge have enthralled BBC Radio 4 listeners since 1950. The computer game re-creation casts you as one of the scriptwriters. The game is split into four parts, in which you control Jack Woolley, Elizabeth Archer, Eddie Grundy and Nelson Gabriel in turn. Guide each character through their decisions (from 3 multiple-choices), with the aim of choosing the most listener-friendly choices. Your choices affect the show's rating directly, as well as changing the forthcoming plot much more than in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/14011/the-secret-diary-of-adrian-mole-aged-1334/\">The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13\u00be</a>.</p>\n<p>Characters can be removed from the show depending on how you develop certain storylines, but make sure not to axe the popular ones. Avoid offending special-interest groups, as the BBC comes down hard on writers who generate complaints.</p>\n<p>Unlike the other versions of this game the BBC version is the only one that comes without graphics, hence it is pure interactive fiction and text adventure, although the input is actually rather limited to choosing answers from multiple choice type questions to progress in the story than typing in commands of one's own choice and finding out how to solve puzzles to go further. The four parts of the game are evenly spread on both sides of the cassette tape. Each of the sides contains two parts of the story.</p>",

The arch mage of the land constructed a magical sword to help defeat the foul wyrm, but during the attempt the sword was smashed and broken into three pieces. Now, decades later, the mage's grandson sets out to roam the land, find the three pieces of the sword, and put it together again to finally defeat the beast.</p>\n<p>The player controls the young mage on his quest in this side-scrolling platformer. The pieces of the sword are scattered all over Wizadore, which consists of a large number of screens, set over different levels connected by stairs. Hindering the mage's exploration of the surroundings (involving ladder-climbing and gap-jumping) are guards, armed with axes or bows and arrows; some of them even ride flying creatures. At the beginning, the mage is helpless, but on the way he can pick up magical scrolls which allow him to cast spells (like lightning or fire) to crush the opposition.</p>",

The player (a robot in charge of a uranium deposit invaded by aliens) this time has to protect already laid down dots on the map instead of picking them up. The enemies are of two kinds: One will run around the map, picking up all the dots. If all dots are taken, the game is over. If there are remaining dots when the time is out, the level is completed and the game progresses to a faster, more difficult level. In order to protect the dots, the player may bump into this enemy, sending it the other way, or he may set up a portable wall to seal off the enemy's path. The other kind is radioactive, and a staggering warning tone sounds as it enters the maze. It must be caught before it contaminates you. Each new level is faster, and more challenges are added.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Space Pilot</em> is a clone of the classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Konami\">Konami</a> game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/12834/time-pilot/\">Time Pilot</a> and was developed independently from the contemporary <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Space-Pilot\">C64 game of the same name</a> with similar gameplay. Players command an aircraft through different environments, shooting down planes to collect points. The ship's nose can be rotated left or right, so the craft can move into any direction and take sharp turns left or right. Speed is not controlled by the user and it is always maintained at the same level automatically. The background is wrapped endlessly both horizontally and vertically, and that way it is impossible to encounter a border. The game takes place in five time periods: 1916, 1940, 1970, 1984 and 1999. Each level holds different types of enemies, from classic biplanes to spitfires, helicopters, jets and UFOs.</p>\n<p>In each scene the player needs to shoot eight regular planes to decrease an icon bar of planes in the top left corner. For every icon that disappears a sound is played and a new squadron arrives. Once all the icons are gone a large boss ship appears and it takes multiple hits to destroy it. After taking it out the plane travels through time to a new period. The player's aircraft has an unlimited amount of bullets. Enemy planes have bullets too, but some of them can also drop bombs or fire homing missiles. In certain environments paratroopers with a red cross appear; these can be collected for bonus points. There are four lives in total before the game is over, but for every 10,000 points a new life is granted. No more than five lives can be held. When all time periods have been completed, the cycle of the five scenes is restarted, but the score is kept.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Welcome</em> is a collection of software published by the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=BBC\">British Broadcasting Corporation</a>. It comprises sixteen separate programs designed to introduce the user to the BBC computer and really simple computing concepts. Within this compilation of educational software are the games <em>Sketch</em>, <em>Kingdom</em> and <em>Bat 'n 'Ball</em>.</p>\n<p>The software was packaged with the BBC Micro and was part of a larger project, commissioned by the BBC and the UK Government's Microelectronics and Education programme, which included 'The Computer Programme' television series, books, a course in BASIC programming and a postal helpline.</p>\n<p>The full contents of the compilation are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Program 1: Welcome  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>This helps the user to set the volume control on their cassette player, essential for loading programs, and goes on to demonstrate the computers sound &amp; graphics capabilities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Program 2: Index  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lists the contents of the cassette and can be used to load the other programs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Program 3: Keyboard  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>This program teaches the user how to use a keyboard and introduces the Shift, Shift Lock &amp; Caps Lock keys. There are five tests and a score is given at the end of each.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Program 4: Sketch  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The player is presented a blank screen in the centre of which is a flashing dot. Pictures can be drawn by moving the dot around the screen using the arrows. This game introduces the player to the BBC's user-definable keys which are used to change the colour of the line being drawn.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Program 5: A calculator.</li>\n<li>Program 6: Alphasort  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is designed to show how a computer can save time &amp; money by performing tedious tasks. The user enters ten words and the computer sorts them into order.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Program 7: Poem  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>A specially commissioned poem with graphics by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Roger+McGough\">Roger McGough</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Program 8: Telephone  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is a simple searchable database of people and their telephone numbers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Program 9: Bat 'n 'Ball  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is a single-player game based on squash. A ball bounces off the back wall of the play area, and the player must manoeuvre a bat in order to keep the ball in play. The length of the play area decreases as the game progresses, this decreases the ball's travel time thus making the game faster and faster.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Program 10: Music  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each key on the keyboard plays a musical note when pressed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Program 11: A clock.</li>\n<li>Program 12: Photo  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here the program demonstrates its graphic capabilities by drawing a picture of a face, famous in 1981, from a series of straight lines.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Program 13: Patterns  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Displays on screen a kaleidoscope that changes when keys are pressed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Program 14: Kingdom  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is a resource management game also known as <em>The Yellow River Kingdom Game</em> and is a conversion of the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Hamurabi\">Hamurabi</a>.   </p>\n<p>The player takes the role of ruler of a small kingdom and in each round / turn must decide how many acres of land to buy or sell, how many bushels of grain to feed the population with, and how much grain to plant. Each decision affects the state of the kingdom as do randomly occurring events such as disasters, weather, etc.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Program 15: Biorhythms  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on the assumption that biorhythms run in fixed cycles that start at birth, this program has the user enter their date of birth so that it can predict their biorhythms on any subsequent date.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Program 16: Message  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>This gives information about other parts of the BBC Computer Literacy Project.</p>",

Alpha Centauri is being attacked by enormous wasps. They swarm over the planet while dropping devastating bombs onto it. The player has to try and kill as many as he can before his inevitable death. The game plays like other shoot em 'ups of the early eighties. The player moves their spacecraft left and right along the bottom of the screen while shooting at the rows of wasps above them. The wasps start in stationary positions at the top but as time goes they take turns and move down towards the player and drop bombs. When all the wasps has been killed off they are replaced with a new and harder wave and the game goes on until the player has lost all their three lives. Points are given for each killed enemy. Stationary enemies are worth ten points while the flying ones are worth a hundred.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Transistors Revenge</em> is a game that not only runs on the BBC Micro, it also takes place in it. The computer's CPU is under attack and it is up to the player to defend it. Other components such as resistors, transistors, capacitors, diodes and fuses have become jealous of the processor's elevated position in the computer. The gameplay can be described as similar to a two dimensional variant of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tempest\">Tempest</a>. The player has a top down view of the the circuit board, with the CPU in the middle and data lines going outwards from it. The enemies will follow these lines till they reach the CPU and the player's task is to stop them by shooting out electrical pulses down the data lines. If any of the enemies reach the CPU it will explode and the player will lose a life. At times different tools such as hammers and pliers appear briefly and shooting these will give some bonus points. In addition to the ordinary fire the player also has access to a powerful zap attack that kills everything on the screen. It can't be used freely though as it will need some time to recover after being used.</p>",

It is also most similar to that game, with the basic gameplay remaining the same. The game consists of 24 levels and the objective of each is to defuse a number of time bombs. Before this can be done however the player has to collect all diamonds and golden crowns and kill all monsters. Failing to do this within a certain time will result in the bombs exploding and the player loses a life. There are a number of puzzles that has to be solved and everything has to be done in a certain order or else the player may block himself in. Therefore it's necessary to plan ahead and pick the right route. As usually the player has to watch out for falling boulders as well as monsters, spirits, skulls and fungus. In addition to boulders this game also features balloons that are equally lethal but floats upwards. There are also certain doors that the player can remove only by collecting absorbalene pills.</p>\n<p>An editor is included with the game. It allows the player to modify characters and levels.</p>",

        "description": "<p>No relation to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/37262/sorcery/\">the more well-known arcade adventure</a>, <em>Sorcery</em> for the BBC is an arcade platformer in the same vein as <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/574/donkey-kong/\">Donkey Kong</a></em>. You, in the shape of a hooded swordsman, must climb four floors of platforms to reach an evil magician who has taken your wife captive. While there are only four stairs to scale, it is a difficult task because of the ghosts, fire-breathing birds, arrows and flying magical balls. You must alternate between using your sword or jumping across them, or fooling the ghosts by going to a lower platform, then up again.</p>\n<p>One peculiarity about <em>Sorcery</em> is that if you are hit, you don't immediately lose your life. Instead, you are transformed into a frog, sitting at the bottom of the screen, and your wife is given the opportunity to climb down to the bottom to free you from the spell.</p>",

The player controls his defender ship left and right and has to prevent aliens from landing by shooting at them. Some protection is offered by four bastions which can take some shots before being destroyed. This version of the game offers three different difficulties with the harder ones offering some additional gameplay features. The easier one, A Mild Encounter, plays like traditional Space Invaders. In the Uncomfortable Situation difficulty the UFO, when it survives without being shot, produces a force shield that guides the aliens and hastens their speed. The hard mode is called A Terrifying Experience and here the alien projectiles have a homing capability and follow the player. There are three different kinds of aliens and they are scored depending on how far from the player they are. The player has three lives and an extra is earned after 5000 and 15000 points.</p>",

The player controls an emergency space capsule which has be to be used to rescue six astronauts stranded on an alien planet. The player starts in a mothership at the top of the screen from which he has to descend down to the surface where the astronauts are waiting. But to succeed he has to navigate his way through a field of meteors and land on one of two platforms at the surface. The player can control the capsule left and right and use thrust to slow down the speed. In addition to the meteors there is also an alien pursuit ship that launches missiles at the player. Once an astronaut has entered the capsule it's time to go back up. Unlike the original arcade game it's the same field of meteors that the player has to move through. The player can now use a gun to shoot at the meteors. When all six astronauts have been rescued the player gets a bonus and moves on to the next level.</p>",

What the player has to do is fly over the volcano, pick up the men one at a time and return them to the platform. This is not an easy task since a large amount of boulder are hurled from the crater and these have to be either shot or avoided. Touching a boulder or crashing into the ground will lead to the helicopter being destroyed and the player loses one life. As if this isn't enough the player has to work quickly since molten lava is pouring from the mouth of the volcano down towards the stranded men. If a man dies he will turn into a ghost which will go after the player. Ghosts have to be avoided since they are indestructible. The player has three helicopters and gets an extra one after 5,000 points scored.</p>",

It initially had the same name, but was renamed to avoid legal difficulties before its release by Superior. The player controls a creature and needs to paint levels divided into rectangles of various sizes. They are painted by moving over the bordering edges, colouring them. When a rectangle is traced entirely, it is filled with a colour. Meanwhile enemies that roam the edges need to be avoided. There is also a limited amount of jumps used to get out of tricky situations. The character has a number of lives and the game keeps tracks of the score.</p>",

For every stage the player has to defeat a number of creatures ranging from killer bees in early levels to red devils and poison orbs in later ones. What makes this more complicated is that the screen is full of pods that when shot at hatches a lizard that immediately goes after the creature closest to it, no matter if that is the player or one of the enemies. Killer bees can be killed by a direct hit from the player while the other creatures can only be killed by the lizards. The player should avoid hitting them since they will then chase him more intently. Lizards can not be killed but when shot at they will turn back into their original pod form. Shots fired will bounce around the screen until hitting something. This include the player so the player not only has to watch out for enemies and their fire but his own bullets too.</p>",

The top half is used to enter text commands to interact with the cube. Each face has a letter and by entering it that face is turned 90 degrees clockwise while entering it with shift held down turns it 90 degrees anti-clockwise. To scramble the cube the player enters X followed by the number of moves to shuffle. It's also possible to have the computer solve the cube by typing S. There's also a feature for the player to draw a custom cube by entering the colour wanted for each square.</p>",

It all happens by a sea where five princesses are located on five islands while the wizard stands on a cliff on the left side of the screen. Now the wizard's job is to protect the princesses from demons that appear in the sky and descends towards the sea. To shoot down the demons the wizard uses his wand. The controls are simple with two buttons used to rotate the wand while another is used for shooting. The magic is limited though and once used up there is no way to take down the attackers. After all demons have been killed the player earns bonus points depending on how many of the princesses remain standing. A new and tougher wave of demons will then appear.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ogles</em> is a pattern matching action puzzle game. Down the bottom of the screen are a number of columns and above these LEGO blocks (here called ogles) in various colours move back and forth. When starting out the right most column is filled with blocks and the player's task is to recreate this stack in the corresponding column on the left side of the screen. This is done by controlling a dog called Flash and picking up the right blocks and then dropping these in the right column. If a block is dropped in the wrong column it will automatically be dumped into a bin. Once the stack has fully been recreated the game moves on to the next level which features one extra stack to recreate. </p>\n<p>There are two difficulty levels: one for younger persons and one for older persons. The difference lie in that the second level is played against a clock and features a scoring system. Each correctly placed block is worth ten points while a block dumped into the bin leads to twenty points being decreased. When completing a level ten time the number left on the clock is given in extra points.</p>",

In the middle of the screen lies a number of pods and it's the player's objective to protect these from thieves that try to nick them. To stop a thief the player simply rams them by moving his ship over them. Double points are awarded if the thieves are killed after they have picked up pods and are leaving the screen. In addition to the thieves there are other things to watch out for. There are monsters that kills the player upon contact and there are UFOs that drop mines that also can kill the player. The UFOs themselves can however be taken out in the same way as the thieves. Once all thieves have been killed the game moves on to the next level which features more enemies. The player has three lives and when they are gone or all pods have been stolen the game is over.</p>",

What's different this time however is that the battle takes place inside the alien. After all attempts with conventional weapons have failed a micro organism is entering the alien's bloodstream in an attempt to kill it from within. </p>\n<p>The player takes control of the microbe (which looks more like some sort of insect) and shoots at the various cells, antibodies, aminos and spores inside the alien. The microbe can be moved left and right but also up and down. Each level has its own enemies with its own appearance and movement pattern. In addition to blasting away at the enemies the player also has to watch out for the projectiles that they drop. The player has three lives and when they are used up the game is over.</p>",

The bank consists of a number of floors connected with ladders and the money bags are scattered all around it. There is a problem though, as four burglars have made it into the bank and are now trying to catch the player so that they can get away with the cash. The thieves also plant bombs at random occasions and when they do the player only has ten seconds to reach it and disarm it before it blows up. If it does or if the player is touched by one of the intruders a life will be lost. In the bank there are two hammers that can be used to knock out the burglars and they'll be stunned for a random amount of time. They can however only be used on the floor that they are picked up and cannot be carried at the same time as a money bag. A level is completed when all bags have been transferred to the vault and a short sequence is shown before the bank reopens the next day with more skilled burglars.</p>",

If any of these aliens make contact with the ship, a life will be lost. Four bases are there to protect your ship, but these bases can be destroyed piece by piece. From time to time, a UFO will make its way across the screen; and shooting it will award you with bonus points. The game ends when all lives have been lost.</p>",

The game is played in a grid-like maze which is viewed from a top down perspective. The tank can be moved forward and turn left and right but only at junctions between buildings. The player has three lives but loses one when colliding with an alien or getting shot. A life is also lost when driving over the flag or letting the aliens get away with all the stars.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Bismarck: Death of a Battleship</em> is a wargame based on the Operation Rhein\u00fcbung which took place in the North Atlantic Ocean in May 1941. The game can be played by one or two players. In the single player game the player commands the Allied fleet while the computer controls the German. In the two player game the second player controls the German forces. The objective for the Allies is to sink the German ships Bismarck and Prinz Eugen before they can escape to Brest on the French coast while at the same time bring Allied convoys to safety. The objective of the German player is to sink as many enemy ships as possible and reach Brest with the ships. </p>\n<p>The game is turn based with each turn representing four hours. A turn may contain four phases: movement phase, update phase, sighting phase and battle phase. The first two happen on every turn. In the movement phase the player issue instructions to units by entering the coordinates they should move to. In the update phase the computer changes the status and positions of all units. In the sighting phase the player can enter battle orders if units of both sides are in the same sector. The battle phase will then be entered and the player can give orders to units to engage, ignore, withdraw or to shadow. </p>\n<p>There is also an alternative scenario that takes place in September 1941. It's based on a fictitious history line where Bismarck and Prinz Eugen have made it safely to Brest. The AI player will here attempt to bring the ships back to Germany by moving them through the Atlantic and the player's task is to stop and sink them. In the two player mode the second player controls the German ships. The alternative scenario is played on the same map but some of the units available are different.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>L: A Mathemagical Adventure</em> is an educational text adventure game that contains mathematical and logical puzzles. The game begins with the player character finding himself outside an old palace. A man dressed as an abbot appears and enters the palace. If the player follows him he will ask for help in finding a girl called Runia who has been captured by the palace's Grey Dogos.</p>\n<p>From there on the player navigates the palace in search for the missing girl by entering the typical text adventure commands: north, south, up, down etc to move between rooms and verb/noun combinations to interact with the environment. At times Drogo robot guards will appear and to get pass them the player has to enter the correct number, which is the square root of the number that is written on their chests. Other puzzles involve turning on spotlights in the correct colours by pulling accompanying switches, filing a key to fit four different key holes and planting nine trees so that there are ten rows with three trees in each row.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Sinbad</em> is an action game that is very loosely based on the stories about Sinbad the Sailor. It consists of two stages each with completely different gameplay.</p>\n<p>The first one is viewed from the side and the task here is to convert Sinbad's enemies to a peaceful way of life. A magic carpet with a rope ladder attached to it as well as a number of enemies are moving all around the screen. Sinbad converts the enemies by touching them but to be able to reach them he has to jump up and climb the ladder. However after they have been converted making contact with them again will lead to Sinbad falling off the ladder which makes it increasingly harder to reach the remaining enemies.</p>\n<p>When all enemies have been converted the game moves on to the second stage where Sinbad sits on the magic carpet and flies through space. This stage is played from a behind the back view of Sinbad and the task is to fly past the numerous asteroids that appear without getting hit. It's also necessary to avoid flying to high or into the atmosphere since that will lead to energy being drained. If too much energy is lost the game will end. The time that the player has to stay alive for in the second stage is the same as the time needed to complete the first stage.</p>",

Taking a shot is done in two steps. In the first one the player sets the direction by moving a cross hair around the table while in the second the spin is set by moving a cross hair over the ball. The player can also increase and decrease the power and cue angle. When done pressing return takes the shot. When setting up a game it's possible to choose the level of the AI and the number of frames to be played.</p>\n<p>In addition to the main eight ball mode there are three other game variations available. The practice session is a free mode without any rules where the player can rack balls and are able to pick up any ball at any time. The high speed attempt mode is a timed game where the player has to pot all balls on the table as quickly as possible to get a high score. Finally, in the high break attempt mode the player has to pot as many balls in a row as possible.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Islandia</em> is a strategy game for two to four players. Each player is in charge of a trading company and the aim of the game is to generate wealth by gaining control of islands. All players start out with their own home port at a large island called Islandia. Surrounding it are twelve other islands. Each have a port and produces food, iron and wood at different quantities. When conquering an island a player's income increases with an amount equal to the wealth of the island. </p>\n<p>The game is turn based and the number of turns a game should last is decided at the start. Each turn consists of one economic phase and two movement phases. In the economic phase the players can buy ships, armies and fortifications. There are four ship types: steamships, battleships, explorers and troopships. In the movement phases players move around the ships that they have bought. When bumping into an island explorers can give information on the commodities it produces as well as the wealth and strength of its native population. Attacking other ships can be done only by battleships and steamships and happens when they bump into an enemy. If a ship gets crippled it will be unable to attack and have its movement allowance halved but it can get repaired at a friendly port. Troopships are used to transport armies between islands which is necessary to conquer new islands.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>JCB Digger</em> is a game where the player is in control of a JCB 3CX Excavator Loader. It is played from a top down perspective and scrolls in four directions with the player being able to drive the vehicle freely around the islands where it is set. On the islands there are meanies, blob-like creatures that the player has to put to sleep. There are two ways to do so. The first way involve digging holes with the backhoe and as the meanies walk into the hole the player quickly has to fill them again with the shovel. The other way to get rid of one is to use the shovel to push it into a salt water sea. If the player is not careful the meanies might capture the JCB and drive away with it which leads to a life being lost.</p>\n<p>Putting eight meanies to sleep leads to a new set appearing. The new ones are of a different colour and are able to pass over landscape that the previous colour could not. In addition to capturing the meanies the player can earn points by shovelling away the landscape. There are three different types of landscape that can be shovelled: undergrowth, marsh and stony ground. When all of the landscape has been cleared from the island the player gets to move on to the another island. There are two islands and the starting one is randomly selected.</p>",

The title's dripping acid comes from a large acid bath located in the centre of the screen and if the player is hit by a drop or the projectiles of the enemies a life will be lost. The player will also die if all acid drops out. There are three different enemies; moths, pods and spinners. Initially there are only moths but if they are hit by acid they will mutate into pods which in turn will become spinners when hit. Spinners require two hits to kill.</p>\n<p>The objective of a level is to escape through a gate that is located on the right side of the screen. The gate opens with time which will speed up when an enemy is hit. When the gate is fully opened the game moves on to a second stage where the player has to move through a side scrolling tunnel without crashing. If a crash occurs the player still moves on to the next level but without a point bonus. There are nine levels in total.</p>",

At the same time he has to watch out for the chasing bad guys called umphs who will kill him upon contact. The umphs can be killed by either throwing a crystal ball which bounces around the tunnels until it hits something or by making apples fall down onto them. Only one crystal ball can be used at a time and thereafter the player has to wait for another one to appear.</p>\n<p>Umphs that get stuck turns into diggers which can digs its own tunnels through the earth. There are also letter monsters who appear after every 5000 points and each has a letter spelling the word extra. When all five has been killed an extra life is given. Once all umphs have left their base in the centre some food will appear. If it is picked up all enemies will halt in their tracks and instead the maras will appear from the letter monster. The maras eat apples that block their path and when killed they turn into apples. When the letter monster or all the maras have been killed the regular enemies come to live again. A level is completed by either killing all the umphs or by eating all the cherries.</p>",

Like in the former the player flies a spacecraft over a terrain full of enemy installations but like in the latter the player can change direction and fly both left and right. The aim of each level is to clear the ground and this can be done by firing laser bolts straight forward or by dropping bombs. Fuel is limited and has to be refilled by dropping bombs on fuel dumps. If clearing the ground takes too long, the aliens will mutate and come after the player. Other things to look out for are rockets, pips and quads. The quads appear on level 2 and on level 3 they start throwing out pips. A limited supply of shields can be used for protection.</p>",

Some monsters will appear and have to be avoided but can be killed by being ran into at high speed. Points can be earned by landing on blocks that the player falls through and by eating cherries.

As the aliens appear from the sides the player has to shoot them down before they start tearing down the prison. If they manage to reach a prisoner they attempt to take it away and if they succeed the player loses one life. Once all the attackers have been killed the game moves on to the next level. For the third level a bug creature will appear. It is smart enough to follow the player and drop bombs and only a hit on its outer extremities will kill it. The game ends when the player has lost all three lives.</p>",

It is also possible to drop land mines and these can then be detonated when enemies pass them by. The player has an energy level that decreases with time. When it runs low the movement slows down and mines cannot be used. To increase the energy the player can eat dots that some enemies leave behind in the maze. Most enemies follow the corridors of the maze but there is also a yellow smiley that can move through walls.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Microbugs</em> is an educational game about computing. A computer has been infected by the titular bugs and it's the player's task to enter the machine and clean out the bugs and repair damaged chips. Initially the player explores the computer by foot and can enter some of the chips. After the first few chips have been repaired the player gets access to a saucer which can be used to fly over the main circuit board. There are eight chips that can be entered and each has its own gameplay:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Main Logic Chip:</strong> A platform game containing six screens where in each the player has to release and activate a robot. This is done by shooting an electronic beam at the cage it is trapped in and then touch it to activate it before finding a way to the exit. Movable blocks can be pushed around and used to reach higher level and there are also elevators to use.</li>\n<li><strong>Artist Programming Chip:</strong> The player is shown an image that has to be recreated through a simple programming language. It simply involves entering the right numbers for shape and colour, x and y coordinates and the size of the object. The player can then test run the script until it is right.</li>\n<li><strong>Binary Character Definer Chip:</strong> The player is shown a grid and has to for each line enter the combined binary value of the squares that are shaded. For example if the three right most squares are shaded a value of 7 (4+2+1) has to be entered.</li>\n<li><strong>Boolean Programming Chip:</strong> The player has to open a number of doors by turning on the wires that go to their control boxes. The screen will show a number of electronic gates (AND, EOR and NAND) which the player interacts with by turning on the correct wires that lead into them.</li>\n<li><strong>Disk Control Chip:</strong> The player has to trap one of the bugs by connecting broken wires. It works similar to a sliding puzzle game where each row or column of the grid can be moved either horizontally or vertically.</li>\n<li><strong>Typesetting (Newspaper) Chip:</strong> The player has to put together news pages by combing boxes in different shapes and sizes with pieces of text. The boxes has to be placed on the page like in a jigsaw puzzle and then the pieces of text that match the sizes of the boxes have to be combined.</li>\n<li><strong>Modem Communications Chip:</strong> The final bug has to be trapped by guiding two robots through a maze. The maze is seen from both a first person and top down view and the aim is to move the robots so that the bug gets chased into one of three traps.</li>\n</ul>",

Part 1 is purely explorative with the player moving from screen to screen by entering directions of movement. Each screen has text describing the surroundings as well as some graphics. Part 2 is called The Test of Fellowship and adds various dangers with multiple ways for the caterpillar to get killed (e.g. getting eaten by a predator or drowning in a pond). Interacting with the game is done with the following commands: climb, dig, still, wriggle, eat, sniff, listen, hide, bristle, scream as well as directional commands (N, S, E, W).</p>",

In order to fit the game into the limited memory of the BBC Micro, the docking sequence had to be sacrificed.</p>\n<p>The player controls a ship at the bottom of the screen, with different squadrons of aliens on the upper half. The objective is to clear the sector of aliens and dock with the mothership. The ship can activate a one use time warp that slows the aliens down for a short while while maintaining its own speed and firepower. The ship's lasers have a temperature gauge, if the lasers overheat they need to be cooled down before they can fire, also at the bottom of the screen there is a fuel meter that measures the fuel consumption of the craft.</p>\n<p>There are eight increasingly difficult sectors in total, each sector has different squadrons of aliens. In the original game once a sector is cleared, an asteroid belt is encountered. The asteroids had to be avoided while shooting fireballs that replenish fuel. With the missing docking sequence that replenished the fuel, all asteroids are now fireballs instead and running out of fuel results in a loss of life rather than game over.</p>",

The player controls Captain Kirk, who finds himself alone on the bridge of the Starship Enterprise. Klingons have attacked and heavily damaged the vessel. The crew has abandoned ship, whilst first officer Spock has beamed over to the Klingon vessel to negotiate a truce, but was imprisoned instead. Kirk now must find a way to repair his ship and rescue Spock, a task which will require infiltrating the enemy vessel as well as visiting a strange alien planet.</p>\n<p>The game is controlled via a simple verb-noun text parser. The current room's description is always at the top of the screen, and local objects as well as possible exits are always displayed as well.</p>",

The player defines descent speed, plane speed, and building height.  The goal is to destroy all buildings to create a safe landing strip before crashing into a building.</li>\n<li><em>Boot Hill</em>: Two cowboys face off to shoot the other.  The cowboys can move up, down, and can shoot horizontally or 45 degrees up or down.  Cacti block shots, but can be destroyed.  Each player scores points when they shoot the enemy, and the player with the most points at 200 seconds is the winner.</li>\n<li><em>Mole!</em>: The goal is to prevent the black moles from eating all the peanuts, while avoiding the white mole that chases the player.  The player defeats a mole by standing beside it and hitting it with a hammer.  There are seven levels of difficulty.  If all peanuts are eaten, it's game over.</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dragon Rider</em> is a 1-player arcade game for the BBC Micro.  </p>\n<p>Deep within their clifftop lair, the player anxiously awaits the onslaught of the alien wyrms.  Beside the player rests their ancient and noble dragon steed.  Suddenly the alarm rings out.</p>\n<p>The player chooses from 1\u20135 dragons per game.  The dragon is armed with a laser lance that uses limited energy, has unlimited range, but can only destroy one wyrm at a time.  The second weapon is the dragon's fiery breath, which can kill a number of worms at a time, but has a limited range and uses a large amount of energy.  The goal is to prevent the wyrms from reaching the bottom of the screen, where they destroy anything they hit.  If the player is hit by the wyrm, the player takes damage, and too much damage the dragon loses a life.  The dragon replenishes their energy by feeding on the magenta firestones positioned on the valley floor.  The dragon skin color reflects its current energy level.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Eagle</em> is a 1-player space-themed arcade game for the BBC Micro.</p>\n<p>The player is now a member of the elite corps known as the Intergalactic Geologists.  The moons of the planet Thrug have been said to contain large amounts of rare trace elements, but the treacherous asteroid belts and lethal underground passages have made it impossible to send a remote probe to survey.  The player must pilot an Eagle Automatic Survey Ship through the moons.  </p>\n<p>The player's ship can move left, right, and accelerate upwards, while gravity continues to accelerate the ship downwards.  Iridium pods replenish a small amount of the ship's energy by passing over them.  Hitting any obstacles during descent will cost the player's energy, and it's game over if energy reaches 0.  Shields can be deployed for a short period of time to reduce damage at the cost of energy.</p>",

Responding to this threat, he transformed himself into a more powerful dragon, and quickly slayed the enemy.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this strain caused his mind to snap when he returned to human form, using his power to burn the townspeople's homes and crops.  The Great Wizard thus designed a prison filled with 16 pieces of a magic spell designed to allow Imogen to release himself once his sanity had returned.  Imogen was secured, and now his quest for freedom has begun.</p>\n<p>Imogen has the ability to turn himself into a monkey, a cat, or return to his human form.  As a wizard, Imogen can walk left and right, and jump a short distance, and pick up, use, and manipulate items.  As a monkey, Imogen can jump on the spot and climb ropes.  As a cat, Imogen can jump a greater distance than the monkey or human form.   </p>\n<p>Games can be saved in progress, and a password feature allows the player to move to certain parts of the dungeon.  Certain objects can be picked up and used at different locations if they are positioned in the wizard's hands.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Starfleet Encounter</em> is a 2\u20138 player space-themed strategy game for the BBC Micro.</p>\n<p>Each player takes the role of supreme leader of a race of space-faring people.  The galaxy is divided into eight star systems, each mapped to a 26 x 16 grid containing five planets.  Each race has a single mothership that is responsible for all new spaceship construction.  The mothership can be damaged and repaired but, if destroyed, that race is eliminated.  Each turn is timed, and players can make as many moves as possible during the allotted period.</p>\n<p>Each player can create up to eight separate fleets of freighters, scouts, and cruisers.  Cruisers are expensive powerful battle ships, freighters allow mining of resources from planets, and scouts allow prospecting of distant areas. Planets can be mined for fossil fuels, radioactive isotopes, and rare metals, which are brought back to the mothership to allow for construction of new ships.  As ships move through space they can encounter meteor storms damaging the vessels, or black holes which throw the fleet randomly through the galaxy.</p>\n<p>When two or three fleets of opposing races occupy the same sector combat can occur.  The aggressor vessel can try to retreat at any time, but may occur more damage by doing so.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Demon Decorator</em> is a 1-player arcade game for the BBC Micro.</p>\n<p>Chased by a demon octopus, the player controls a paint roller trying to color in all lines of a 6 x 7 grid.  The roller moves along lines, and when a level begins only the edges of the screen have paint.  The player must start at an active section, and can draw up to three line segments before running out of paint.  If this happens, the lines painted are lost.  If the player completes a small rectangle they receive points, and the edges of the rectangle become active.  </p>\n<p>A level is complete when all rectangles are filled.  The octopus chases the player around each level, costing a life if it catches up.  Every level the octopus moves faster.  The player starts with three smart bombs which temporarily stun the octopus.  More can be picked up on the maze.  When a level is completed, the player is awarded one life and one smart bomb.</p>",

The player controls a small character who moves laterally at the bottom of the screen, can move upwards a short distance, firing directly forwards.  The Vogons approach from the top of the screen, and will move down a line and change direction if they are shot or hit an object.  </p>\n<p>The goal each level is to destroy all the Vogons.  If the player shoots an asteroid it begins to fall towards the player, but can be shot again to be destroyed.  Chargers fall directly towards the player, while Crushers bounce about the bottom of the screen.  Crawlers move laterally across the screen and leave warp vectors, which will move any Vogon in contact to the bottom of the screen. The player starts with three lives.</p>",

The number of Klingon vessels, star bases, and days to complete the mission are randomized at the beginning of each session.  </p>\n<p>The galaxy consists of a 8 x 8 quadrant map, and each quadrant is divided into 8 x 8 sectors. Quadrants can have stars, which are deadly to navigate through, and star bases which allow refill of energy and torpedoes.  </p>\n<p>The ship is armed with torpedoes and phasers. The player has a limited number of torpedoes, but these instantly destroy a Klingon vessel. Phasers use the ship's energy, which is also used to supply shields and power hyperspace jumps between quadrants.  Long range sensors allow locating Klingons in nearby quadrants.  Shield control allows management of ship systems.</p>",

The aliens move as a group until they reach the edge of the screen, move down one space, and reverse direction.  Spaceships occasionally fly across the top of the screen.</p>\n<p>Three large shields offer protection from incoming fire.  Aliens' shots often break into many smaller pieces as they close in on the player.  If the player is hit they lose a life, and if the aliens reach the bottom of the screen it's game over.</p>",

The player loses missiles if the missile silo in the center of the screen is hit.  When all cities are destroyed, it's game over.</p>",

This has quite upset Boris, so he delves into the underground to reacquire his belongings.  Boris moves in all directions, and can fire in the cardinal directions.  On each level, monsters move towards the player, and the fiery walls of the underground approach from the top and bottom.  Boris must shoot all the monsters, who take multiple hits to destroy, to make his stolen possession appear.  The player must grab this before the walls close in.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Jack and the Beanstalk</em> is a 1-player arcade game for the BBC Micro.  The player controls Jack as he tries to steal bags of gold from the giant in the clouds.  Gameplay is divided into two levels: the ground level with Jack's house, and a sky level representing the giant's castle. </p>\n<p>There's a beanstalk that grows in the center of the screen beside Jack's house when the weather is rainy. When the sun comes out, caterpillars run along the bottom of the screen and shorten the plant.  The player can collect caterpillars and butterflies without damage.  If the player jumps and touches the axe it instantly cuts down the plant.  The player can collect golden eggs in this section, and must avoid touching the smoke from Jack's chimney.  </p>\n<p>Jack can climb the complete beanstalk to reach the giant's castle.  Here, the giant and deadly snails patrol.  The giant moves about randomly until the player picks up gold.  Then the giant follows the player and will even chase him to the ground level.  Jack must quickly reach the bottom of the beanstalk and cut down the tree before the Giant reaches the bottom.  Gold can then be stored at Jack's house while he waits for the plant to regrow. The player can pick up a shovel in the castle to dig holes, which kill snails and slow down giants. The player has limited time to collect as many bags of gold as possible.</p>",

The helicopter can move in all directions, and can drop bombs if moving slowly, but will fire horizontally when moving faster.  Numerous buildings dot the landscape, and these are filled with hostages.  Tanks prowl along the ground, and these fire a short distance in the air.  If their bombs hit a building it breaks and the hostages stream out.  If the player lands near hostages they will get on the helicopter, and the player can return them to the starting point to safety.  Care must be taken not to bomb or land on hostages.  The helicopter can hold nine hostages at a time.  As the player travels further from their base, they begin to encounter more dangerous enemy craft, including enemy helicopters and spacecraft.</p>",

The ostrich walks if on a platform, but will take to the air when it flaps its wings.  </p>\n<p>The goal is to hit enemies from a higher vantage point to destroy the knight and its mount.  Once the enemy has been hit, an egg falls to one of the platforms below. The player must destroy the eggs before they hatch into a new knight. </p>\n<p>Other dangers include lava trolls who attempt to pull knights into the fire, and a vicious pterodactyl.

The player must navigate their frog across a busy road and a dangerous river to reach the five holes in the riverbank at the top of the screen.  The player moves in the cardinal directions as cars, logs, turtles, and alligators move horizontally across the screen.  </p>\n<p>Turtles will intermittently submerge, posing a danger to the frog.  The frog must hop on an alligator's back, avoiding his teeth or tails.  Flies sometimes appear in holes, which can be eaten for bonus points.  Dangerous alligators sometimes appear in these holes.  </p>\n<p>The player starts with three lives and, after safely placing five frogs in holes, the player encounters a faster-moving level with more road traffic and fewer safe spaces to cross the river.</p>",

The player moves in the cardinal directions, and can pick up and drop rocks.  Dropped rocks will fall to the bottom of the screen, and if they hit a monster, the monster is destroyed.  </p>\n<p>Mutants and robots move about the screen and emit a yellow light.  Being caught in this beam reduces the player's strength.  If the player is touched by a monster or loses all their strength they lose a life.  If the player is caught in the beam while not carrying a rock, the enemy transforms into a specter or cruncher.  The specter chases the player while the cruncher eats rocks.  The player starts with three lives.</p>",

Game play occurs until the player or house has run out of money.</p>",

The player is armed with their spaceship and trusty photon gun, and can move laterally and shoot vertically to blast incoming vessels.  When the player clears every ship on the screen they advance to a new challenge.  Aliens have a variety of movement patterns and firing rates.  Every five levels the player encounters an asteroid field that must be avoided.  The player has limited energy that is drained by firing and, if this reaches 0, the ship is destroyed.  Every fifth level the player further encounters their mothership, which if they safely dock with will recharge their energy.  The player starts with a total of three lives.</p>",

During that time it is possible that minor repair work may need to be carried out on certain parts of the ship.</p>\n<p><em>Discovery</em> is equipped with single-astronaut EVA (Extra Vehicular Activity) pods to carry out deep space repairs.  This simulator tests the ability to pilot an EVA pod through eight progressive levels of difficulty before the Flight Training Crew will give clearance for the Saturn mission.</p>\n<p>Played from a 1st person perspective, the EVA pod has 6 degrees of freedom control consisting 6 separate jets consisting of pitch, yaw, roll, forward, lateral, and vertical movement.  These have 9 levels of power, and must be shut off when not wanting to be used.  The player also controls 2 manipulator arms that can be moved up, down, opened, and closed. The instrument screen provides information on EVA pod forward, lateral, and vertical speeds, as well as rate of change.  The instrument panel also displays remaining fuel and horizontal and vertical angles to and from <em>Discovery</em> to allow for safe return to the ship.  All successful missions must end with a safe ship docking.</p>\n<p>There are 8 levels of mission difficulty, and the player receives a score based upon their performance.  This score must be sufficiently high to receive a promotion to the next level.</p>",

The player follows the lines of the web and, at each intersection, can choose to turn clockwise or counterclockwise.  Spiders continuously appear, and these must be avoided or shot, and the player's shots can bounce around corners before dissipating.  </p>\n<p>The goal is to move into all seven edges of the web holding it in place, and leaving a bomb in these locations.  The player can then escape off the right edge of the screen as the web is destroyed.  As levels progress, faster-moving bugs and flying wasps begins to appear, further endangering the player.</p>",

The plane moves in all directions, and has a nose and tail gun used to shoot down defending German planes. As the player approaches the water, spotlights appear that allow the player to judge the correct distance and height to release their bomb, which will hopefully bounce into the dam and destroy it.  The player has three planes in total, and each successful dam destroyed leads to a higher challenge, adding more defending planes and anti-aircraft guns.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Tutankhamun's Revenge</em> is a 1-player arcade platformer for the BBC Micro.</p>\n<p>In 1922, centuries after Tutankhamun's tomb was sealed and forgotten by the ancient Egyptians, its steps were uncovered for the first time.  Within the tomb, the excavators found the message, \"Death will come to those who disturb the sleep of the Pharaohs\".  Almost immediately, some people associated with the excavation died unexpectedly.  The player must explore the many rooms of the Tomb of Tutankhamun and uncover all its treasures.</p>\n<p>The player moves laterally and can jump.  If the player falls too far or are touched by an enemy, they lose a life.  Numerous vertical- and laterally-moving platforms add extra difficulty.  The player attempts to gather keys which open doors to other chambers.  The player starts with five lives.</p>",

Each hole is shown from a top-down perspective, and the player is supplied the distance to the hole.  The player chooses from four woods and nine irons.  When choosing a wood the player opts to hook or slice, while with an iron power from 7\u201399 percent is chosen.  The game automatically aims towards the hole with some variation.  Once on the green the game switches to a sideview where the player must input putting power from 1\u201315, with the correct strength needed to sink the ball. Score is carried over 18 holes.</p>",

Each turn the player can move their laser to a different row, or place a mirror with a deflection factor of 1\u20138.  When a laser hits a deflection point it changes direction, and the laser can hit up to 25 mirrors before running out of power.  </p>\n<p>When all positions have been filled with mirrors, it's game over.  Mirrors can not be set up in front of a laser or beside a brain. There are three difficulties of board layout.</p>",

The ship has made many fantastic discoveries, from intelligent gas-based lifeforms to a strange race of radioactive dwarves.  As the ship approaches the outer limits of the solar system, the crew realizes they're running out of fuel to make it back to Earth.  The ship must make an emergency landing on Mars.</p>\n<p>Played from the cockpit viewpoint, the player must carefully navigate the ship.  The player has 10 levels of engine burn, from off to maximum deceleration.  As the ship speeds up it heats up, and if the shields hit greater than 5000 \u00b0C, the ship will burn up. The ship must land at a velocity of less than 10 m/s to land safely.  The player has limited fuel to manage the descent.  The player must also manage X and Y velocity to safely land, keeping the ship aligned with the landing zone.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Thunderball</em> is a 2-player arcade game for the BBC Micro.</p>\n<p>Game play is divided into three components. The purpose of the first two sections is to obtain ammunition pods which carry through to section three.</p>\n<p>In the first section, players try to demolish two sections of wall by bouncing a ball into it.  Each player controls a paddle that moves laterally.  The paddles are located at the top and bottom of the screen while the wall is located in the center.   Once the walls are demolished, the ball bounces vertically until in contacts one of the three acorns that move laterally at the center of the wall.</p>\n<p>In the second section, the bat becomes a horizontally-moving laser base which fires towards the center of the screen.  The outer wall now moves in the opposite direction of the central conveyor. The goal is to clear a path to the central ammo conveyor where ammo pods can be claimed by the player.   Then all pods are claimed from the conveyor belt both players enter section three.</p>\n<p>In section three each player starts off with a bouncing ball in the center of their own cyclotron.  The goal is to entirely fill the player's fuel tanks, or completely deplete their opponent's tank.  In the cyclotron the player can transfer fuel and ammo from the secondary to the primary tanks.  Fuel can be gained by firing at the target located on the piston.  Ammo is credited to the secondary tank by colliding with the player's own ammo pods.  Ammo can be used to blast the other player and deplete their fuel stocks.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>International Megasports / The Genesis Project</em> is a package containing a 1\u20134 player Olympiad sports game and a 1-player 3D space shooter for the BBC Micro.</p>\n<p>In <em>International Megasports</em>, the player competes in seven sporting events: High jump, long jump, 100m spring, 110m hurdles, archery, and skeet shooting.  During each event the player is given three attempts to meet the qualifying score for the competition.  The player can set records by hitting one of the three world record scores.  All running events are controlled by rapidly tapping between two keys.  The third key is used for actions like jumping or shooting.  In skeet shooting, the player can fire from the left or right barrel from their shotgun as a target moves rapidly up and down.  In archery, the player must deal with wind effects and set the angle of their shot to try to hit targets that move across the screen. In the high jump, the player must time their leap to not hit the post.</p>\n<p>In <em>The Genesis Project</em>, the year is 2143 AD.  The Star Federation has managed to maintain an extremely fragile cease fire between the planets within the six zones of the Gamme-Serti System.  Now, planet Targon-3 has claimed a rare mineral Trilithium found on an asteroid.and, to reinforce its claim, has constructed six Cobolithium Detonation Devices in each of the zones within the system.  The player has been given command of the advanced star cruiser, the Genesis Probe.  The mission is to travel through all the zones and neutralize the devices.</p>\n<p>Played from a 1st-person perspective, the player uses their twin Q-Class phasers to destroy incoming enemy vessels. Asteroids can be destroyed to harvest dilithium, which can be reprocessed into an explosive to destroy the enemy bombs.  The player can access the intergalactic map and ship status, and hyperspace to different combat zones.</p>",

Each turn the player is given a weather report and the cost of cotton candy production. The player must decide how much candy to try to sell, the cost per unit, and the advertising budget. The player tries to maximize profit each turn.</p>\n<p><em>Star Trek</em> is a strategy game where the player must destroy a specific number of Klingon vessels within a set number of days. The universe is divided into 8 x 8 quadrants, each of which are divided into 8 x 8 sectors.  Long-range sensors view the characteristics of nearby quadrants, while short range sectors show all items in the current quadrant.  Stars provided navigation hazards, and star bases allow replenishing of energy and the ship's limited torpedoes.  The ship has limited energy which can be used to supply shields or phasers when under attack by Klingon vessels.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Atlantis</em> is a 1-player side-scrolling arcade game for the BBC Micro.</p>\n<p>A legend recorded by the Greek philosopher Plato tells of a great island west of the pillars of Hercules, adorned with every beauty.  Circa 9400 B.C., an attack was made on Europe by the people of Atlantis.  But these invaders were driven off by the Europeans.  Later the island's inhabitants became wicked, and Atlantis was, as a consequence, swallowed up by the ocean.  </p>\n<p>The year is now 2100 A.D. and, once again, Europe is under threat from the Atlantians, aided by high technology weapons and defense systems.  The player's mission is to infiltrate the defenses of the undersea city of Atlantis and destroy everything they see.</p>\n<p>The player controls a submarine that fires directly forwards and drops bombs.  The submarine can move in all directions in the left half of the screen while enemy dangers approach from the right.  The game is divided into multiple stages where new dangers appear.  These include missiles launching from the ground, caverns full of jellyfish, ships dropping mines, barricades that raise from the floor, attacking eels, and other dangers.  The player gains points from destroying the Atlantian infrastructure on the seafloor.  The player starts with three lives and, if they hit a danger, they restart an individual stage.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Tower of Alos</em> is a 1-player roleplaying game for the BBC Micro.</p>\n<p>The valley was once ruled by a fair king called Alos.  He built three strongholds in his land.  One he gave to a young dragon called Temadra, another to his brother, and the last was left to his soldiers.  Alos then built himself a large tower, 13 levels high.  However, Alos became enraptured by black magic, which caused terrible damage to his land, ushering in an invasion of evil beings which crushed Alos' army, and threw the land into terror.  </p>\n<p>The player moves their character on a large map consisting of forests, the marsh, the Temple of Bragi, four towers, village, and the hoard.  The player can buy healing potions at the village (up to nine at a time) and gold can be stored at the hoard.  The brother's tower is a safe area where the player can regain hit points and gain experience levels.  When entering any of the hostile towers the player fights multiple rounds of 10 monsters at a time.  In the swamp, the player can enter burrows to find monsters or engage in random combat.</p>\n<p>The player gains experience points and treasure from fighting monsters.  When encountering enemies in the forest, the player can choose to attack or retreat.  In combat, the player is surrounded by monsters and chooses which direction to attack.  The player and enemies automatically take turns engaging. The more gold the player carries, the slower they will attack in a fight.</p>\n<p>To complete the game, the player must reach level 7, clear Temadra's Den, The Garrison, The Temple of Bragi, and the Tower of Alos, as well as collecting four magic items and a boat, then returning to the safe castle.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Gondor</em> is a 1-player role-playing game for the BBC Micro.</p>\n<p>Long ago, there was a powerful kingdom called Gondor.  One day, evil forces arrived in the form of a Dark Lord from Mordor.  The four heirlooms of the kingdom\u2014the ring, helm, sword, and shield\u2014were scattered far and wide, and the king's daughter was taken captive. There was one brave knight, Arthur, who set out on a quest to return the four items and rescue to princess.  If successful, he will receive the hand of the princess and become heir to the throne. </p>\n<p>The player explores a 4x4 map of the world, where each section contains a large map that the player can explore.  The character has five statistics: speed, vision, power, defense, and hit points. Vision determines how far a player can see on the screen.  The player moves by selecting a direction and how far to move. Attacking is also by selecting a direction.  Enemies appear on the map and don't move.  The player can move up to them and attack them, and receives damage if too close. Chests and random items appear on the screen.  A wandering wizard can grant positive or negative statistic changes. The player can cast magic spells which can also modify statistics.</p>\n<p>After collecting all four heirlooms, the player enters the second half of the game, where the player must get a crown from the city in the Enchanted Sector, and the princess must be rescued from the castle in Mordor. These are displayed as 3D mazes that the player explores.  Keys to unlock the treasure in one area can be found in the other.</p>",

All activity occurs in real time, and the non-active vessels continue to move.  Individual ships have limited energy, which is used by all action commands.

Energy can be harvested from the destroyed vessel, and brought back to the starbase.  If the returning vessel is damaged on return the energy can be lost.

        "description": "<p><em>Missile Attack</em> is a 1-player arcade game for the BBC Micro.</p>\n<p>For several years, delicate talks with an aggressive enemy have been underway.   Finally, these negotiations broke down, and full-scale thermonuclear war has ensued.  The player is the fearless commander of one of the country's many advanced ABM defense systems, tasked with defending the six main centers of culture.</p>\n<p>The player controls three missile defense turrets at the bottom of the screen.  Each turret has 10 missiles per round, and the shot location is determined by moving the targeting cursor.  The goal is to destroy incoming enemy missiles before they destroy the six cities at the bottom of the screen.  Missile turrets that are hit are removed from the remainder of the round, but are rebuilt on the next level.  Destroyed cities are removed for the rest of the game.  It's game over when all six cities are destroyed.  The player receives a bonus for remaining missiles and cities at the end of each round</p>\n<p>Enemy ships also appear: Semi-Intelligent Drones which weave their way down in a sinusoidal pattern and destroy a large area when they hit, and Unintelligent Support Vessels, which fly in a horizontal path and take no evasive action.</p>",

These multiform creatures plunge down towards the player in suicidal attack waves while dropping lethal Grycon bombs.  The player's ship moves horizontally at the bottom of the screen, and fires vertically with laser cannons.  </p>\n<p>Enemy ships move randomly as they fall towards the bottom of the screen, returning firing towards the player.  When a ship reaches the bottom of the screen it immediately jumps back to the top of the screen, and then descends more quickly.  When all enemy ships are destroyed the player moves to a higher challenge.  The player receives a time bonus on completing a level, and starts with three lives.</p>",

The people consulted with the druids and the mystics, who divined that the Warlord's soul and body had been separated, and that the soul must first be found and destroyed before the warlord could be defeated.  The people of the valley chose Tumblestone, the greatest warrior the valley had ever produced, to be their savior. </p>\n<p>The player controls Tumblestone as he explores the many locations around and inside the Warlord's castle.  The player deals with knights, dragons, giants, mazes, and other dangers to try to complete their quest.  All commands are via VERB NOUN entries.  The program is divided into two parts, finding the Warlord's soul, and then defeating the Warlord himself.  There is a save/restore feature.</p>",

The player's job is to try to kill the snow-bees that live in the freezer before they kill Pengi.  The snow-bees can be destroyed by kicking ice blocks into a snow-bee.  They can also be killed by kicking the electric fence that surrounds the freezer to stun any snow-bees that are nearby, and then kicking the stunned snow-bee.  The snow-bees can break down ice blocks, and if they touch Pengi, the player loses a life. When all snow-bees in a stage are killed, the player moves to a more challenging stage. Each level has three special diamond ice blocks that the player receives a bonus if they are lined up.</p>",

Enemy Demolators race horizontally across the screen and pass over top of human cargo.  Initially every seventh cargo they pass over is destroyed, and each level has an additional Demolator up to eight per level, and then this reduces to four, but they then destroy every sixth human cargo. Minors appear stationary on the screen, and later morph into mines than can not be removed. Protectors move about the screen and fire towards the player.  Finally, the Trackor homes in on the player's position, and fires towards the player.  The player clears a stage when all Demolators are destroyed, but destroyed humans persist between stages.</p>",

The mouse can jump or fall between levels at gaps between the shelves. On the shelves are saucers and cups, and the mouse knocks the items one shelf lower if it touches them.  The player has 99 time units to try to knock all items off the lowest shelf, breaking everything.  After breaking everything, the player must find the cheese hidden on the level. On each level is a different animal that threatens the mouse.  First, birds which fly along shelves, then frogs which jump between levels. Next comes cats and then bats.  If the player beats all 4 stages, then they repeat with the enemies moving 1.5x faster.  The player starts with 3 lives.</p>",

At the beginning of a level, the player is given the number of grubs and honey cells they're required to fill to complete the level.  The player fills sections of nest and honeycomb.  </p>\n<p>The player controls a probe, that can select from different eggs at the bottom of the screen.  These eggs can be empty, contain dangerous weevils, or include bees that can be placed in the hive.  If a weevil appears, the player must search the periphery of the screen for a letter, and press it, before the weevil damages the hive. Bees can include drones, soldiers, grubs, queens, and workers, which have a different influence on the hive.  Runaway larva block the path of the probe and prevent the placement of more bees.   If the bottom row fills with larva the player can not place more bees, and the game is over.  There are three skill levels.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Funfair</em> is a 1-player arcade game for the BBC Micro.</p>\n<p>The player controls a gun that moves horizontally at the side of the screen, while trying to hit a series of horizontally-moving targets.  The goal on each level is to clear the screen of ducks, rabbits, and teddy bears. The player has a limited number of bullets each level, so must shoot carefully.</p>\n<p>Occasionally ducks will release from their pegs and fly down.  If they reach the bottom of the screen they eat five bullets.  If a duck is hit in the body it is destroyed, but if shot in the wing it descends faster.  Extra bullets can be gained by shooting the numbers that scroll past or shooting the bullets that appear in the special box to the left of the screen.  To prevent more ducks from joining the rows the player must shoot the bell at the right of the screen by hitting the slider below it. </p>\n<p>If a level is cleared, then the player enters a bonus screen where the player must shoot through moving screens.  Each level has faster-moving enemies.</p>",

Players take turns firing a ray into the grid and observing the exit point.  When a player believes they have determined all atom positions, they can mark them on the screen.  Once all players have marked their atoms, their true position is displayed and points are awarded.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gambit</strong>: 1\u20134 player game on a 15 x 15 board.  The goal is to move both characters to the center holding area from the far corner.  Each turn, the player can position one barricade on the board that blocks opponent characters, but allows theirs to pass.  The player rolls two dice, and their character can move in the cardinal directions, and must move the distance of one of the dice.  The dice moves can be split between two characters or just one character.  The first player to move both characters to safety is the winner.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

Brogfelt found sanctuary within the Dungeons of Terror, and broke the diamond into four parts, hiding them amongst the monsters of the dungeon.  The King, distraught, has offered half his land to anyone who can retrieve the four crystals.  The player has approached the King who has offered three prisoners to serve as their companion as they enter the dungeon themselves.</p>\n<p>The player receives three randomly generated characters defined by strength, magic ability, carrying weight, and treasure.  There are nine levels of game difficulty, and the player is given the location of the four crystals at the beginning of the adventure.  All commands are via text entry, and the player can move north, south, east, west, up, and down.  Treasure items can be picked up to increase final score.  Potions offer benefits to characters.

Vast ships, thousands of meters in length, are being constructed many miles above the Earth's surface. These ships serve another purpose however.  As well as functioning as research vehicles, others are used to transport dangerous criminals to distant prisons built on planets many light-years from Earth. </p>\n<p>The player is a prisoner on the <em>Goliath</em>.  Over two miles long, the ship has long since left the Earth's solar system on its long journey to Gamma Minor, an icy, alien world on the very edge of space. The cell in which the player has been held the last three months is small, cramped, and uncomfortable.  Even at 20 times the speed of light, the journey will take many more months. One morning, however, the player awakes to find the ship at rest and no other sign of human activity. The <em>Goliath</em> has been abandoned.  The player must escape from their prison cell and find the reason for the apparent abandonment.</p>",

The craft can fire thrusters, and rotate clockwise or counterclockwise, and has limited fuel.  There are three difficulty levels which determine the number of obstacles to avoid.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pete the Plastered Postman</strong>: Pete must deliver parcels to the red rectangle at the top of the screen while avoiding the dog that chases him. After a successful deliver, he must return to the red pillar box at the bottom of the screen to pick up another parcel.  Because Pete likes to oblige the whisky bottle, the player's movements are hampered, and the character often moves in the opposite direction or usually just sways in place. The player gains 100 points for each parcel delivered, and loses one point for every bite.  Time limit is 10 minutes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

If the lion closes its mouth while Ernie is in position, then Ernie loses his head.

In the first three stages, the player flies through flat plains, a mountain tunnel, and then a defended valley.  Triangles and enemy creatures appear on the horizon.  White and red ones can be shot for increased energy, but the player loses energy if they fail to shoot a red enemy.  At the end of the third stage, the remaining energy can be used to save hostages.  The player moves their ship left and right from a top down perspective in the fourth stage, and must avoid red triangles that approach from the bottom of the screen.  When a hostage appears, the player can use their transport beam to rescue them.  </p>\n<p>After completing a hostage rescue mission, the player attempts the challenge again with more dangerous mutants.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Renegade Robots</em> is a 1-player arcade game for the BBC Micro.</p>\n<p>The planet is currently under threat of invasion.  To counter this threat, scientists have invented a totally new weapon that is being guarded in a manufacturing plant staffed entirely by sophisticated robots.  However, a series of explosions have caused the robots to violently spiral out of control.  </p>\n<p>The player controls a small character who moves in the cardinal directions in a room filled with crates.  These crates can be pushed to trap and crush rampaging robots.  A crate when pushed will move in that direction until it hits another crate or the edge of the screen, and then will be destroyed.  Green robots chase the player through the maze, while purple robots will also push and destroy crates.  At the start of each stage, the preview timer counts down indicating the time until robots start to appear.  Only four robots appear on the screen at a time, but as they are destroyed more can take their place as displayed on the bottom of the screen.  If the bonus timer reaches zero or all robots are destroyed, then the player moves on to the next stage.   </p>\n<p>Each level has an additional robot to contend with.  Three special key cubes are present on each level.  The player scores bonus points if these are used to destroy a robot, and these key cubes can not be destroyed.  The player also can also score a large bonus if all 3 cubes are aligned, and an extra life if they are aligned with the flashing cube in the center.  The player starts with 3 lives.</p>",

The goal is to retire after making a million dollars.  The player purifies their astod by eliminating liquor.  The player must also reduce and eliminate the waste product muckle, which can damage the plant.</p>\n<p>Liquor is delivered to the plant by road tanker into the store tank.  There, it is pumped into the reactor, where it is converted to astod and muckle with unprocessed liquor.  Customers will only buy astod of certain purity. This mixture is then pumped to the still to be purified, and the astod is pumped to the stock tank, and the muckle is filtered off.  Remaining product gets sent back to the store tank.  If any tank overflows it backs up into the previous tank, or even onto the floor.</p>\n<p>To control this process, the player modifies reactor volume and temperature as well as still bottom temperature and top flow.  The player can also fill astod tanks, empty liquor tanks, or shut the whole plant down for the day if there is risk of major malfunction.  If any of these processes become out of balance then alarms will be sent to the player.  Alarms can indicate pump failure, overflowing tanks, high temperatures, or rubbish being made.</p>\n<p>At the end of each day, the player has two minutes to process management options, including: cleaning equipment and changing processes, mending equipment, making some equipment bigger, checking market forecasts, financial reviews, or consultancy to help with other major issues.</p>",

Four large bases provide protection from enemy fire, but also block the player's shots. These get damaged when shot. Enemies move as a group laterally across the screen until they reach the edge, move down one row, and reverse direction. Enemies return fire at the player, and the player must destroy all enemies before they reach the bottom of the screen.  UFOs move across the top of the screen which can be destroyed for bonus points.  There are eight levels of game difficulty, and the player starts with three lives.</p>",

It possessed magic that gave the king who wore it and his heirs great wisdom and power.  The Kingdom was peaceful and prosperous, except four evil Barons who were jealous of the King's power. When the old King died, the three Barons split the jewels amongst themselves, and the fourth took the crown itself.  The player has pledged allegiance to the King, and must overcome the Barons to return the crown.  Each of the crowns are now guarded by a ferocious dragon, which the player must outsmart to gain their prize.</p>\n<p>The player must find money to buy items to complete their quest.  All commands are via VERB NOUN entry.  The player receives 250 points for each part of the crown retrieved.</p>",

The player tries to shoot and destroy a large alien swarm that moves back and forth at the top of the screen.  To complicate this, enemy diving shielders sweep in from the edge of the screen and fire at the player.  These ships always run straight towards the player.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Demolish</strong>: The player controls a laser gun that moves horizontally and fires vertically from the bottom of the screen.  Trapped by a large red wall, the player must blast away the wall while avoiding falling bricks, radioactive particles, and mutated lifeforms.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Task Force</strong>: Each player controls five battleships separated by a large island at the beginning of the game.  Each turn, all five battleships can move, and each player fires from a single ship each turn.  Battleship firing is controlled by selecting an angle and firepower.  If a ship is hit, it's sunk.  Every few turns, both players fly a kamikaze plane from the corner of the screen.  The two players move their planes simultaneously, and whichever player manages to hit a ship first sinks that vessel.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

The player can move and kick blocks in the cardinal directions to defeat them.  Snobees can also be killed by kicking the electric fence that surrounds the level to stun any nearby Snobees, and then kicking them. The Snobees can break down ice blocks and, if they touch the penguin, the player loses a life. When all Snobees in a stage are killed, the player moves to a more challenging stage. Each level has three special diamond ice blocks that the player receives a bonus if they are lined up.</p>",

If a bird is carrying a block when hit, the block will stay on screen until the next bird comes.  An evil creature moves laterally across the screen from side to side, and Wilfred must turn into a frog to avoid being hit.  Wilfred can not fire while in frog mode.

If the opponent is hit, their current tail is removed from the playing field.  It's game over when the player has been destroyed three times.</p>",

The goal is to protect the six valuable supply containers in the center of the screen from enemy raids.  Enemy tanks can dock with the supply tanks, and try to pull them off the screen.  The player can also recover and move tanks that remain on the screen.  Enemy tanks initially have no ammunition, but can return fire if they steal supplies.  The player gains points for enemy tanks destroyed, and has an infinite number of tanks.  It's game over when all supplies are lost. In two-player games, the players cooperate to protect the supplies.</p>",

The opponent vehicle will always change lanes towards the player, and can move one lane per opening. The player can change one or two lanes per opening, and can accelerate or decelerate.  Because shorter inside lanes take less time to traverse, the time between two vehicles passing remains variable.  The player starts with three lives, and gains 10 points per pellet.</p>",
