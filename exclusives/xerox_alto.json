The gameplay wraps around at the edges of the screen meaning the player's bullets that exit the right of the screen will reenter on the left creating an additional hazard for the players themselves.

        "description": "<p><em>Missile Command</em> is an unofficial port of the arcade game for the Xerox Alto. The player controls three missile batteries at the bottom of the screen and must fire missiles to intercept incoming projectiles and enemy aircraft. Failing to do so will cause destruction on the ground where multiple city blocks can be blown up. The individual missiles silos can all run out of missiles so there's some tactics in deciding which one should fire. When the player's missiles explode their explosion grows and lingers for a while allowing the player to knock out multiple targets with a single blast. The game can be played solo or with two players in turns (comparing high scores).</p>",
