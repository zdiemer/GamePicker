Traditionally these include rain, hail, lightning and tornadoes; in this version these are joined by one new defensive weather type, snow, which when properly aimed can coat your building with a soft and protective layer that insulates against hail damage.</p>\n<p>The weather emanates from a cloud that randomly ambles now here, now there across the top of the screen between turns. With wind speed also variable, players need to input a number informing the angle at which the weather should be discharged from the cloud, hopefully so as to land on their opponent's house. When one house is wholly demolished, the game is over.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>KMahJongg</em> is a Mahjongg-Solitaire implementation. The player has to clear a board filled with 144 stones by removing pairs with the same symbol. You are only allowed to remove a pair if both stones are \"free\", which means they do not have stones connected on both left and right side or a stone above them.</p>\n<p>There are six different graphical tile set available, including the traditional set. Beside the default \"turtle\" layout, there are over 70 board layouts to chose from. The game comes with a board editor, which makes it easy to create own board layout. The game has a hint system, indicating you pairs to find. Using hints prevent the scores to be added to the high-score table. The game can be configured to create solvable board situations (many randomly created Mahjongg boards cannot be cleared with any sequence of removed pairs). Required time, removed pairs and the amount of currently possible removals are always shown on the bottom of the window. games are load- and savable, the high-score list is persistent and you can start a board with a game number, which allows to re-create a certain board situation (which also means you can exchange boards with other people by giving them this random seed).</p>\n<p><em>KMahJongg</em> is part in the KDE game module which is usually included in the any installation of the KDE desktop (but the game is also playable on any other Linux desktop system and can be installed on it's own).</p>",

Stones are places on a flat rectangular board and have to be removed by pairs of the same symbol. Each symbol applies four times on the board. Pairs can be removed if the connection between them can be made with a line that only can be drawn horizontally or vertically with maximal two corners.</p>\n<p>The board size can be configured, from 84 stones (14x6) up to 480 stones (30x16). The default size are 144 stones like in most other <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Mahjongg\">Mahjongg</a> games. Beside the board size, the difficulty can be set in three steps from easy to hard. The game can be configured to only produce solvable boards (many boards created randomly are not solvable with any sequence of pairs removed). An extension called \"Chinese style\" allows the removal of stone groups, like a flower can match all other flowers and not only it's identical flower symbol. If you are stuck, you can get hints by the program, but high-scores are locked if you are doing so.</p>\n<p>An extension to the original game, the game is using gravity by default, that means stones are falling in removed spots from top to bottom (like in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tetris\">Tetris</a>). Gravity can be turned off.</p>\n<p>The game shares its six graphical tile sets as well as the background graphics with its cousin <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/74818/kmahjongg/\">KMahJongg</a>. </p>\n<p><em>KMahJongg</em> is part in the game module which is usually included in the installation of the KDE desktop (but the game is also playable on any other Linux desktop system and can be installed on its own).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>KSquares</em> is an implementation of the pen and paper game <em>Dots and Boxes</em>. On a grid each player connect two points with a line each turn. The goal is to connect four lines to create a square. Filling a square allows the player to add another line to the grid instantly, making it possible to fill many squares in one turn. The game ends if all grid points are connected, and therefore all squares are filled. The player with most filled rectangles wins.</p>\n<p>The <em>KSquare</em> game can be played with different board sizes from a very tiny 2x1 fields up to a very large board of 50x30 fields. Up to four players can compete locally, any missing players may be filled with an player controlled by the computer. The playing level of those AI opponents can be altered in three degrees from \"Easy\" to \"Hard\". The game is featuring a \"Quick Start\" mode, in which there are many lines already connected, which results in much faster action by skipping the repetitive starting phase. A high score table is present and can be persisted.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>KBounce</em> is an arcade game with a puzzle element. The single-screen levels are made of blocks, with walls around the inner field. The goal is to fill 75% of the inner field with blocks. Creating blocks can be done by starting either horizontal or vertical lines by clicking on a block in the field. From the selected block and chosen direction, two new walls are growing until they reach the next solid wall. But there is a problem: in the level there are balls, moving and bouncing of each solid stone they encounter. If they hit a growing wall, you loose a life and the created wall part vanishes. If they however touch the head of a growing wall, the wall continues to grow and the ball bounces of like it touched a wall. As the new wall is growing in two directions from the selected spot (e.g. up and down for a vertical line), only the part of the growing wall that was hit is consumed. This allows partial construction of lines and building of separators in the level. If a line finally reaches a wall and there is a closed area created with no ball inside, that area is filled with new blocks.</p>\n<p>Each level has an increasing amount of balls flying around. Starting with two balls in level one, there are eleven balls in level ten. Also, the amount of lives is no session counter, but set to the amount of balls in that level. This means in higher levels there are always more lives available and those can be used strategically to build partial constructions. There is also a time limit, which is increasing with each level solved. You earn bonus points for remaining lives and time at the end of a level. A high-score table can be reached and saved. The player can chose from six different graphical tile sets and the game difficulty can be set in three steps from \"Easy\" to \"Hard\".</p>",

The player controls a bat at the bottom of the screen which can be moved left and right. In each level a formation of bricks has to be destroyed, by letting a ball bounce from your bat. Controlling the flight of the ball is like in most <em>Breakout</em> games: as closer the ball hits the bat at the border, the higher the angle the ball reflects. A life is lost if the ball passes the bottom border.</p>\n<p>The game features many additional features: on destroying bricks, some random bonus items may drop, which can be collected by the bat. There are items rewarding extra points, extra lives, a wider bat or a ball with destroys all bricks around the stone it's hitting, there are also items with negative effect like a smaller bat or even instantly loosing a life. You can get multiple balls or items altering the stones in the level. The levels are constructed of different brick types, including stones initially not visible until hit, or bricks that explode on contact, destroying all stones around them.</p>\n<p>The scoring system rewards points for each brick and each item collected. Passing a level grants you a bonus, but loosing a live decreases the score pointer by a huge amount. A high-score table can be reached.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Granatier</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Bomberman\">Bomberman</a> clone. Up to five players compete in an arena, trying to be the last man standing. On the game start, the arena is filled with stones, either destructible or indestructible. The player can drop bombs, which destroys any stone or player in four directions (up, down, left, right). Destroyed stones may drop items which enhance the size of your bomb explosions, grants you another bombs to drop at the same time, or makes the player move faster. There are also items which negatively affecting the player, like inverting the control or preventing you to drop bombs for a certain amount of time.</p>\n<p>The game features 38 different arenas, which are partly containing special stones: on ice the player cannot stop and moves further until the next solid ground, arrows move bombs in a certain direction, or the bomb mortar, which throws a bomb planted on it in a random direction. Unlike the original game, not all mazes are surrounded by solid blocks, and the player instantly dies if running over the border of the level. The amount of rounds can be configured as well as the time for each round. Also, the initial speed of the avatars and the amount of bombs available can be configured to make the game start faster.</p>\n<p><em>Granatier</em> supports maps created for the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Clanbomber\">Clanbomber</a> and can import those. The mazes are stored in a XML format which allows the creation of own levels, which is described in the manual. The game only features keyboard control, but although fully configurable, it may make a five player game difficult. There are no computer controlled bots to add to the game.</p>",

In a single-screen maze the player has to collect all dots to finish a level. Four marauding ghosts are trying to prevent this. There are four power-pills in the edges of the maze, and after eaten one of those, the player can chase and kill the ghosts for a specific amount of time.</p>\n<p>The game features the original maze and 20 levels, which are all played in the same maze, but both the speed of the ghosts and player are increased with the ghosts slightly getting more faster than you. The AI of the opponents is quite simple: if the ghosts can directly see the player (no walls in-between), they are directly coming for the player. If they cannot see the player, they are moving randomly. There are five different graphical themes, altering the graphics of the maze and the moving sprites. Playing the \"Invisible\" theme is a challenge, as all walls are invisible, and the player has to navigate with the dots or his knowledge of the maze layout. There are three different difficulty settings and the player can start on any level.</p>\n<p>After 1/3 and 2/3 of the dots removed in the level a bonus item appears awarding 200 points. Chasing ghosts is the most effective way to gain points, as the first ghost is worth 200 points, the second 400 up to 800 for the fourth ghost captured during the seconds a single power-pill is active. Each 10.000 points an extra-life is gained. A high-score table can be reached.</p>",

The game ends if no player can set a stone any more. The winner is that player with more stones on the board.</p>\n<p>The game can be played with two human players, but also an AI can take the role of one or both players.

        "description": "<p><em>KDiamond</em> is a tile-matching game, in which the player has to build rows or columns of at least three identical colors. This is done by exchanging to adjacent stones (horizontal or vertically, not diagonal). Overall there are six colors on the board. The board size can be configured by the game difficulty. In the \"Very hard\" setting the board is of the size 8x8, while in the \"Very easy\" mode the board has a size of 12x12. If stones are removed, all stones from above the position are falling down and the missing stones are replaced with random stones at the top. With clever planning (or simply luck) chain reactions of removed tiles are produced by the falling blocks.</p>\n<p>The game can be played with or without time limit. If playing with time limit removing stones also grants some bonus time, so the end is not fixed, but can be extended by removing many tiles. <em>KDiamond</em> has different graphical tile sets and a high-score table. Hints can be shown on request and in the toolbar the amount of possible moves in the current board position is shown.</p>",

It makes the game more like a <em>Snake</em> variant: you control the head of your snake and the tail if not solid, but of a specific length. Collecting bonus crystals increases the size of the tail. Random obstacles are constantly appearing on the screen and a collision must be avoided.</p>\n<p>In both modes, the game features five different difficulty levels, which change the speed both players are moving.

The player is chased by robots trying to kill him. The goal is to survive until all robots are dead. In this turn-based program the player can move his avatar in all eight directions over the board. In each round, the robots make a step in the direction of the player. If they touch him, the game is over. But the robots are also deadly to themselves: if they touch each other, they turn into a pile of garbage and this pile is also deadly for other robots. So to kill the robots, the player has to move that the robots touch each other or running into garbage piles. If there is no way out, the player can teleport to a randomly location on the board. Teleporting is consuming energy, which can be refilled by destroying robots or completion of a level.</p>\n<p><em>Killbots</em> implements additional game elements taken from the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Gnome+Robots\">Gnome Robots</a>, like fast-bots, which can move two fields in a round and save teleports, in which the destination cannot be directly beside a robot. Another addition is the vaporizer, which lets you destroy robots. Also junk piles may be pushed. There are five game modes, which feature different rule sets, the additional features and have different board sizes and also differ in the energy consumption. There is one mode with the same rule set and board sizes like in the original game, a mode in which the energy cannot be refilled, a mode with the vaporizer to use. Another mode mimics the rule set of the Apple game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/37061/daleks/\">Daleks</a>. And there is a beginner mode, in which the board is randomly filled with garbage. There are four different graphical tile sets including one with the graphics of the text console display of the original game.</p>\n<p>A high-score table can be reached.</p>",

You have a board filled with colored stones and the goal is to clear the board completely. You can remove stones when at least two stones of the same color are beside each other. On a removal, all stones adjacent in vertical and horizontal directions are also removed. The stones above the removed spot are falling down filling the holes (like in <em>Tetris</em>, but no new stones appear).</p>\n<p>If a complete column is cleared, the column is removed making the board more narrow, so stones from the left over columns can be removed. Completely clearing the board required good planning and a bit luck. The amount of leftover pieces if no more removals are possible is counting as a score and is recorded in a high-score table, separated by the difficulty level. There are four difficulty levels. While in the \"Very easy\" setting only three colors are on the board, in the highest difficulty level \"Very hard\" there are six colors. Games can be saved, and the random seed can be set for a level so the exactly same boards can be reproduced.</p>",

By putting together the atoms with the corresponding connectors, the molecule can be finished. The player can move each atom, and it will move in the chosen direction until a wall or another atom is hit so that it is often required to move additional atoms to places just to use them as \"stoppers\".</p>\n<p>The game is featuring three different level packs: the original levels from <em>KAtomic</em> with 83 levels in increasing difficulty. An extension pack with another 25 levels and finally all 30 levels from the original <em>Atomix</em> game. Games can be saved and loaded. Moves can be taken back (Undo and Redo).

        "description": "<p><em>KJumpingCube</em> is a puzzle/strategy game played on a squared board. A board is filled with cubes and the goal is to recolor all of them to win the game. Each cube has a certain amount of stones laying on it giving it a numerical value. Starting the game, the board is filled with neutral colored cubes of value 1. Clicking on a neutral field transforms this cube to the players color and gives it value 2. Each turn, one own or neutral cube can be selected. Choosing an own stone increases it's number. If a cube has a higher value than neighbors in horizontal or vertical way, the cube unleashes one point to all neighbors (keeping one on it's own), recoloring to the players color and adding one to their value. This can lead to huge cascades as for each cube an stone is added another check is done and it may spread too.</p>\n<p>The game can be played on board sized 3x3 up to 15x15, either with two human players or with computer players with five different strength levels and two alternative strategies. The game can provide hints about good spots to select cubes. Moves may be taken back with an undo function and games can be saved and stored.</p>",

On a square board there are several \"interlinks\", some are straight lines, others bended in 90 degree or having a branch off. On the board are an amount of \"servers\" and a single link to the internet. The tiles cannot be moved, but by rotating them correctly connections to other links can be established. To solve a level all servers must be connected to the one \"Internet\" link.</p>\n<p>There are four different difficulty levels which have different board sizes and amount of servers to connect: in the \"Easy\" level there are six servers on a 5x5 grid, and in the highest difficulty level \"Very hard\" there are 23 servers on a 9x9 board. There can also be custom board of size up to 11x11 usable. The score is calculated by the time used to solve a level and the amount of rotations required. There are high-score tables for each of the difficulty levels and two graphical themes to chose from.</p>",

This version of the game is presented in 3D wire-frame, and you can thrust forward, backwards, left, right or up. A heading indicator will show you the location to the landing pad, while the fuel gauge shows you how much fuel is remaining for your thrusters.</p>\n<p>This game was originally released for Unix/X, and was subsequently ported/compiled for several Linux distributions.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>XTetris</em> is a clone of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tetris\">Tetris</a> for the X Window System. Like <em>Tetris</em>, pieces of four connected blocks fall from top of the play area and must be organized as they fall. The goal is to construct horizontal lines of blocks with no gaps. When this happens, all blocks in the line(s) are erased and more space is available to continue play. When the play area is filled to the top with blocks, the game is over.</p>\n<p>This specific version is a fairly faithful single-player adaptation of <em>Tetris</em>, with the addition of a piece placement guide/preview below the bottom of the board. It can be run in Black and White and Colour modes, depending on the capabilities of the X Window system it is used in.</p>\n<p>From the version history, <em>XTetris</em> has been modified and built by the efforts of several individuals. It was originally created as a X11 port of a non-graphical tetris game for the Xw (HP) widget set. Versions 2.0 and later were ported to the standard Xaw (Athena) widget set and are the most commonly-available versions. These versions report themselves as <em>XTetris 2</em> in the application window.</p>",

As per the original, there are also power pellets in the maze, which will allow you to eat the ghosts for a limited period of time.</p>\n<p>Where this version differs is the maze layout, which is randomly generated on the start of each game. The size of the maze can also be altered using command-line arguments. Power pellet placement can be anywhere, and the number of ghosts can vary based on maze size. On the default size, 8 ghosts are present. Finally, the game does not have any scoring or lives mechanics; if Pac-man is caught by a ghost, the maze automatically resets. If Pac-man clears the maze, a new maze is generated.</p>",

The level is considered completed when this occurs.

This mode uses boxes that can only be pushed in a specified direction, as well as pushers that automatically move boxes, one-way arrows and a few other mechanics. Unlike traditional Sokoban, multiple boxes can be pushed together. The objective is to reach the exit, not to place boxes in designated locations.</p>\n<p>Xsok levels are unique to <em>xsok</em>. They may combine any combination of the above mechanics, as well as several new elements. In general, all traditional Sokoban boxes must be placed on their designated spots then reach the exit. Some of the additional mechanics in this mode include teleporters, 'no block' or 'no player' squares, and a strength mechanic which controls which types of boxes you can push.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>XPat2</em> is a collection of patience (solitaire) games for the X Window System on Linux and Unix. The rules can vary by specific game, though usually involve organizing the cards into a series of \"foundation\" piles by rank, removing the cards according to specific collection rules, or organize in some other way. Each game has specific rules about how the cards can and cannot be moved in order to eventually organize/remove them all.</p>\n<p>The complete list of included games is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Baker's Dozen</li>\n<li>Blue Moon</li>\n<li>Calculation</li>\n<li>Canfield</li>\n<li>Free Cell</li>\n<li>Gypsy</li>\n<li>Idiot's Delight</li>\n<li>Klondike</li>\n<li>Michael's Fantasy (invented for this game)</li>\n<li>Midnight Oil</li>\n<li>Modified Canfield</li>\n<li>Monte Carlo</li>\n<li>Oonsoo (adapted from Hanafuda cards)</li>\n<li>Royal Cotillion</li>\n<li>Seahaven Towers</li>\n<li>Spider</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rather unusual for a computer solitaire game, the left mouse button will directly move the selected card to the most likely valid destination. To move a specific card to a specific destination, the middle mouse button must be used instead.</p>\n<p>This game is based on source from a previous game known as XPat, which was, in turn, based on a Sun Microsystems version of Spider solitaire known simply as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/152063/spider/\">Spider</a>.</p>",

Like the original, the goal is to locate all mines in a grid, by carefully testing squares. After a square is tested, it will report the number of mines in the adjacent squares. Empty squares tested will automatically expand until bounded by squares near mines. Based on the displayed numbers, the user needs to infer the correct location of mines and flag them, before testing additional squares.</p>\n<p>Like the original, this can be played in beginner, intermediate, or advanced sizes. It also allows the user to customize a difficulty by setting both the grid dimensions and the number of mines.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>X Solitaire</em> is a basic implementation of Klondike Solitaire for the X Window System, using the Motif toolkit. Like most implementations of Klondike, the goal is to sort all cards into four foundation piles by suit, from kings down to aces, where aces are low. Cards can be dragged around individually or in sequences, and can be placed on a card of opposite-colour suit of one rank higher than the selected card. For example, a black 7 can be placed on an red 8 (hearts or diamonds). Cards are initially dealt into seven columns, with an increasing number of cards in each column, and only the top card initially turned face-up. As cards are moved off the face-down cards, they can be turned up and used in play. Additionally, the remainder of the deck is available for use and can be cycled through one card at a time, then moved into play if they match the card placement rules.</p>\n<p>This particular implementation is very basic, with no card art and no detection of the win state. When the game is won, it is up to the user to restart the game through the menu. The game does include some options, such as enabling/disabling score and timer support, as well as switching between draw one and draw three modes when pulling cards from the deck.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>XShisen</em> is a Mahjong solitaire game, usually known as Shisen-Sho. The objective is to remove all tiles from the board by selecting matching pairs of tiles. The tiles can be removed if a line can be drawn between the tiles with no more than three orthogonal segments that does not overlap any other tiles. Practically, this usually means that the tiles are on the same side of the game board, or are adjacent, though this simplification is less applicable as more tiles are removed.</p>\n<p>This implementation supports three different board sizes:* Regular (18x8)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Large (24x12)</li>\n<li>Huge (36x16)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It also supports playing with or without \"gravity\". When gravity is enabled, pieces will fall towards the bottom of the screen as they are removed.</p>",

The objective is to be the first to reach a distance of 700 kilometers, which can be optionally extended to 1000 kilometers by the first player to reach it. Each turn consists of pulling a single card from the deck, followed by either playing or discarding a card. Distance is accrued by playing cards corresponding to the distance to travel. Other cards consist of hazards/conditions (e.g. flat tire), counters to the hazards (e.g. spare tire), and rare protections against hazards (e.g. puncture proof). The game starts with the \u2018Stop\u2019 condition active, and a \u2018Go\u2019 card must be played before you may move.</p>\n<p>This particular version of the game is played solo against the computer.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>xsol</em> is a solitaire/patience for the X Window System similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Klondike\">Klondike</a>. The goal is to sort all cards into four foundation piles by suit, from kings down to aces, where aces are low. Cards can be dragged around individually or in sequences, and can be placed on a card of opposite-colour suit of one rank higher than the selected card. For example, a black 7 can be placed on an red 8 (hearts or diamonds). Note, however, that there is no visual indication of dragging, and the cards are only moved once the mouse button is released.</p>\n<p>Cards are initially dealt into seven columns, with an increasing number of cards in each column, and only the top card initially turned face-up. In this particular variant, any face-down cards are hidden directly under the face-up cards and cannot be seen until cards above are moved off them. Once this happens, they can then be used in play. Additionally, the remainder of the deck is available for use and can be cycled through one card at a time, then moved into play if they match the card placement rules. This version only permits the deck to be flipped through once. After the deck is exhausted, and no more moves are available, the game is over.</p>",

It also explains about PIN codes, state levy, dividends, digital prescription, salary, income tax, VAT, etc. In addition, the game has a lot of tasks and other fun activities, like rally, paintball, designing clothes, publishing a magazine, pets, etc.</p>\n<p>The game runs on Unity and the development cost about \u20ac286,000; it was funded by the Estonian government to teach citizens in a playful manner. Character speed regulation and high scores are sent from the client to server without checks, this allows speedhacking and editing of scores; however rarely admins have corrected leaderboards.</p>\n<p>The game was played internationally for a moment in 2019, when YouTuber \"aksually\" made a video showcasing and criticizing the game.</p>",
