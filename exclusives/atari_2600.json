        "description": "<p><em>Basic Math</em> is a math game for children.</p>\n<p>Each game gives the player a set of ten basic math problems (i.e. simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) to solve. The player is presented with two numbers and a function, then inputs the answer by cycling through numbers with the joystick. A timer option is available to ramp up the difficulty. The game has eight primary game settings - basically two settings for each mathematical function. Games 1-4 allow the player to select one of the numbers the player will be working with, while 5-8 give random questions. </p>\n<p>Hint: For division problems that have a remainder make sure to put a space between the whole number and the remainder, which goes to the right.</p>",

The archaeologists' only hope of survival (apart from some very fast running) is an ancient device known as the 'make-break', which can be used to either create or destroy pieces of wall.</p>\n<p>In this increasingly frantic one or two-player arcade game, you'll need wits as well as dexterity. You'll have to think on the fly, plan strategically and race through the maze as fast as you can. Fail to keep up the pace and you're zombie fodder. Good luck!</p>",

E.T. can collect Reese's Pieces scattered around in order to regain energy which is constantly depleted with time. </p>\n<p>The phone pieces are in some of the pits, and E.T. must jump in to get them; sometimes there's also a dead flower in the pit which provides extra points if brought back to life. Once E.T. has done his business in the pit, to get out he must levitate his way out, though he must watch out not to fall into the pit again after leaving. </p>\n<p>Evil scientists and agents wander around the area, trying to capture E.T. and steal the parts he's carrying.</p>",

Luckily, though, the noble Atlanteans have heard of Alpha Ro's plight and have sent a vast Cosmic Ark thousands of light-years across the galaxy to try and save as many species as possible. As the captain of the Ark, the player will have to contend with deadly meteor storms and planetary defense systems to succeed the mission.</p>\n<p><em>Cosmic Ark</em> features two play screens: On the first, the player will have to blast meteors with four-way cannons. Blast enough and the player can go on to the second screen. The Ark descends low over one of Alpha Ro's planets. The player will then have to guide a shuttle craft down and beam aboard two creatures, while avoiding any laser defense system that may be in operation. The player will have to get the creatures back on board quickly, because another meteor shower could happen at any moment. Then it's off to the next planet!</p>",

These creatures can generate lethal electric charges, and are now after you! Using your laser gun, you need to defend yourself from the onslaught of Electrosauri. The deadly creatures can come from above, the left, or the right so be sure to keep an eye on all corners of the screen! There are numerous game variations included which dictate the number of attacking creatures that can appear at a time,  their firing characteristics, and the overall difficulty level.</p>\n<p>Each time you eliminate a large Electrosauri, you'll gain 115 points, whereas smaller ones hold a value of 165 points. The fast-moving marsupods emerging from caves on both the left and right will grant you 200 points.</p>",

Wandering throughout the arena is a seeker which is capable of firing laser bolts. To be victorious you need to destroy your opponents shield by having the seeker fire laser bolts at it. You are armed only with a light saber which is used to control the direction of the laser bolts you fire, as well as block incoming fire from your opponent. The first player to break through the other players shield wins a point, and the first player to 3 points wins the match!

Robot Tank is a first person perspective arcade style action game. There are twelve squadrons of tanks to destroy, each containing twelve tanks. Each time you destroy a complete squadron, you earn an extra reserve tank before moving on to the next, more difficult squadron. The game takes place twenty four hours a day; gameplay will alternate from early morning to mid afternoon to late at night. In addition to the constantly changing time of day, the weather can also change unexpectedly. Snow, rain, and fog will appear occasionally making it tougher to spot your targets. Luckily your tank is equipped with radar to help locate the enemy when visibility is poor. As your tank takes damage you will lose some capabilites, such as speed, the radar, or your canons. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed; the game ends when all of your reserve tanks are gone.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Krull is a multi part action game based on the movie of the same name. A beast and his army have traveled through space until finally landing on the distant planet of Krull and ravaging the entire planet. But there is a prophecy which tells of a king and queen who will someday take back the planet. These future rulers are Princess Lyssa and Prince Colwyn. But before their marrage, Princess Lyssa is captured by the beast! </p>\n<p>You play the part of Prince Colwyn on a mission to rescue Lyssa and destroy the beast. The game is divided up into several parts.</p>\n<p>The first part takes place during the foiled wedding. A large number of slayers arrive at the castle, and you need to defeat as many as you can to earn points. But eventually Princess Lyssa is captured.</p>\n<p>In the next section you need to ride your horse towards the Widow's web; on the way you can collect Glaives which may be used to fight the beast. Once you reach the web, you need to make your way to the cocoon at the top of the web in order to find the correct path to the Black Fortress. The crystal spider along with strands of the web make maneuvering your way around this screen a challenge. Once you know the correct path, you ride on to the Black Fortress. </p>\n<p>Here you need to use the Glaives you've collected to free the Princess from a prison, and then destroy the beast!  After successfully completing all tasks, the game will repeat at a more difficult skill level.</p>",

Joe, you need to defend the recruits at a training camp from the evil Cobra, who is attacking the camp in the form of a giant snake. You control a shield and a gun; as the recruits run along the bottom of the screen towards safety, you need to use the shield to block the deadly venom and laser beams coming from the snake. When you get a chance, you can use the gun to shoot the snake. Hit the snake with eight direct hits and it will be destroyed and you can move on to the next level. If the snake manages to kill four of your recruits, the game is over. In the two player version of the game, both players can play cooperatively and try to destroy the snake together, or one player can control the snake and one protect the recruits. In the three player version, two players protect the recruits while the third player controls the snake.</p>",

The goal is to earn as many points as possible by having the player's attack saucer shoot down the varied enemies which fly by. Tanks, jet planes, prop planes, helicopters, and weather balloons will all pass by on the screen and try to destroy the player's saucer. There are even some trees and houses on the ground that can be shot for extra points. The player needs to make sure they avoid colliding with the various enemies and their fire or one of the player's three saucers will be lost. Extra saucers are awarded for each 1000 points earned.

Your goal is to defend your home planet from the various mutant warriors which are attacking. You control an anti-mutant cannon on the bottom of the screen and need to shoot as many of the mutants at the top as you can. At the very top of the screen, a Mother Creature will be creating mutant eggs that fall into the formation. The eggs will slowly hatch into various creatures which fly down and try to bomb or crash into your cannon. If you destroy the Mother Creature as well as all of the mutants on the screen, you will move on to the next, more difficult level. Several game options are included which allow you to enable or disable a shield, guided fire, a time warp to temporarily slow down the game, and penetrating fire allowing you to take out several mutants with one shot.</p>",

The player controls a juggler who needs to keep multiple fireballs within the play field. The juggler can hold on to two fireballs at a time, so be careful because if he tries to catch a third it will fall off the screen. The goal is to destroy the bricks at the top of the screen by hitting them with the fireballs. When all the bricks are destroyed, the player moves on to the next round and is given one additional fireball to keep in play. Five different game variations are included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Firetrap:</strong> Two additional fireballs are trapped within brick walls. Once a hole forms in the walls, the player will also need to keep these additional fireballs in play.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Marching Blocks:</strong> In this game, each time the player catches a fireball, the rows of blocks will drop down one level. From time to time, a mystery fireball may also appear.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Knock-A-Block:</strong> This is the most basic game variation. There is a solid wall of blocks at the top of the screen that the player needs to destroy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Migrating Blocks:</strong> In this game, the rows of blocks move. Every few seconds each row of blocks will rotate either to the left or to the right.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cascade:</strong> There are five additional fireballs trapped within the block formation. When the player destroys enough blocks to release an extra fireball, it too will need to be kept in play.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

After each concert, your goal is to guide the five band members to the escape vehicle so they can get to the next concert on time. You start with $50,000 from the concert and need to guide one band member at a time; the screen scrolls vertically, and you need to get past the crowds and various obstacles before time runs out. Trying to slow you down are numerous fans, reporters, promoters, and photographers. Running into each of these will cause you to lose some of the money you start with, and also precious time! Stage barriers and fences will also cause you to lose time, but you won't lose any money if you hit one of these. To help you out, roadies and your manager are also in the crowds. They will give you temporary invulnerability allowing you to run straight through any obstacles. The game ends when a band member doesn't make it to the escape vehicle before the timer runs out. As the game advances, there will be bigger and bigger crowds to avoid, and they will be more aggressive about getting in your way!</p>",

When the game begins, a mixed up character will appear on the screen and you need to change the head, body, and legs until they are all from a single character. If a complete character is correctly formed, the character will perform a dance and you will hear their musical theme; if an incomplete character is formed, the musical theme heard will be partially from each of the characters you did create. Several levels of difficulty are included which dictate the time limit and which character needs to be created. In the easier levels, the character you must create will be indicated by text at the bottom of the screen. In the more difficult levels, you must create a character based on the theme song that plays.</p>",

In the two-player game, the first player to complete 25 laps wins! Included are several different race tracks, two difficulty levels, and additional game variations called ice race, tag, and crash 'n score. In ice race, the track is icy causing your car to slide often and making it difficult to steer. In tag, one player is \"it\" and needs to tag the other player. For each second you race without being tagged, a point is earned. Lastly, in crash 'n score the goal is to crash into targets which appear on the race track. The first player to crash into the target earns a point, and then a new target will appear elsewhere on the track.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Video Olympics</em> is an action game containing numerous variations of the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/6734/pong-variants/\">Pong</a>. Two players (or one player against the computer) control paddles on the screen and attempt to prevent a bouncing ball from getting past them. In the most basic game variations, each player has a single paddle and there are no obstacles on the screen. The other game variations add paddles and obstacles, and some are loosely inspired by various sports and change the playfield around, but the goal remains the same: hit the ball past your opponents paddle into the goal to earn points. A few of these variations are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Foozpong</strong>: Each player controls multiple paddles which are arranged somewhat like a foozball table.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Soccer pong</strong>: Each player controls two paddles (representing one goalie and one player) and the goal is much narrower.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hockey pong</strong>: The playfield is set up to resemble hockey; the goal isn't at the very edge of the screen, so the ball may bounce behind and around the goal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Quadrapong</strong>: The goals are located along the top, right, bottom, and left sides of the screen. This game is played by four players, two per team with one person defending each of the four goals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Handball pong</strong>: There is no goal, and two players take turns hitting the ball against a solid wall to earn points. One point is earned each time your opponent is unable to return the ball.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Volleyball pong</strong>: The screen is set up like a volleyball court with a \"net\" in the middle. Both players are along the bottom of the screen and need to bounce the ball past their opponent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Basketball pong</strong>: Each player controls a paddle on the bottom of the screen, and attempts to hit the ball into their opponents basket at the top.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

You control a microscopic submarine navigating the bloodstream of someone who has been infected by a virus. Your goal is to destroy the virus! Each time you shoot a cell infected with the virus, it will split up into smaller pieces. Eventually the pieces will be small enough that they can be destroyed. When everything has been destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult level. The game features three levels of difficulty, and you can choose one of two shooting styles for your submarine (single torpedoes, or rapid fire).</p>",

Swimming back and forth constantly is a deadly shark. If the shark encounters any of the diamonds, it will eat them; likewise you can also be eaten by the shark, causing you to lose a life. You have no defense against the shark, however you are immune if you are in the shark cage and the doors are closed. Somewhere in the maze the Loch Ness monster remains hidden.

You need to catch all of the luggage that is tossed out, or all of your clothes will be scattered around the airport. As the levels progress, more and more luggage will need to be caught, and the games speed increases. There are two difficulty levels available; the easier mode gives you two men to catch luggage with, and the harder mode gives you only one man. Several other game variations are also available: if the terrorist suitcase option is enabled, explosive suitcases will occasionally appear. If you don't catch these, the game immediately ends regardless of how many lives you have left. If the suitcase control option is enabled during a two player game, you are able to control the direction your opponent's suitcases travel.</p>",

In an intergalactic war, an enemy ship called Dromeda is attacking your home planets and you need to defend them! The planets are located at either the top or the bottom of the screen, and are defended by a shield. Dromeda is in the middle of the screen, and will be launching explosive devices at the planets. You control a spaceship which is the last hope to save the planets. Unfortunately, your ships lasers are unable to reach Dromeda, so you you must shoot the explosives as they come in. If you miss any explosives, they will destroy part of the shield. If a large enough hole forms, an explosive could get through and destroy an entire planet. The game ends when all of your planets have been destroyed.</p>",

Each time you are hit by a coconut, you lose one of these items. You may also regain an item by scoring enough points. The game ends when you have nothing left to protect yourself and a coconut hits you. Of course, the longer you can last in the game, the faster it becomes!</p>",

If you miss any eggs, they will break and yolk starts collecting at the bottom of the screen. Miss too many, and the game will be over. At the end of each round you will be given an opportunity to earn bonus points; you now get to throw all of the eggs you caught back at the bird! As the levels progress, the games speed will increase. There are two difficulty levels available, in the easier variation you get a larger hat to catch the eggs with.</p>",

You control a fly swatter at the bottom of the screen; your goal in this game is to protect your hamburgers (located on the left and right bottom of the screen) from the attacking flies. When a fly is close enough, it will stick out its tongue to eat the food. If you can swat the fly right when it has its tongue out, it will be knocked out and fall into your fly trap. When all of the flies have been knocked into the trap, you will then need to face a large super fly before the level is complete (be careful, it can eat your food fast!) After knocking out the super fly, you move on to the next round. The game ends when all of your hamburgers have been completely eaten.</p>",

After the second player is hidden, the first player needs to locate him or her in the shortest time possible. After the second player has been located, the roles will then be reversed. The game takes place in an old house with three rooms available as well as the front yard to hide in; each of these four locations contains five different places to hide. The game can be played with fixed or variable hiding locations; in the fixed game, the hiding locations will always be found in the same place, and the variable game will move the hiding places around each time a room is entered. Two difficulty levels are available; in the tougher setting, the entrance to the hiding places is narrower making it tougher to find.</p>",

You control a photon cannon at the bottom of the screen, and your goal is to protect six energy stations located to your left and right. Waves of rockets and other ships will fly by on the screen, and occasionally one will drop in an attempt to destroy one of the stations (as a warning on most levels, the enemy will turn white just before it drops). You need to make sure you shoot it before your energy station is destroyed! When all six energy stations are gone, the game is over. A two player variation is also included; one player will control the photon cannon, and the second player controls a cursor and can select when and where an enemy will drop. The players alternate between offense and defense in this version.</p>",

Your goal is to guide the raft as far down the river as possible while avoiding the many obstacles. You will come across dangerous rocks, trees, beavers (which chop down trees making more obstacles!), and even a moose, all of which can sink your raft. For each segment of river you travel 125 points are earned, and additional bonus points may be earned by collecting gold nuggets which you will encounter in the river from time to time. You begin the game with three rafts (bonus rafts can be earned), and the game ends when all of the rafts have been sunk. Several difficulty levels are available which control the speed of the current, as well as the speed of the beaver and moose.</p>",

Your goal is to rescue as many survivors as possible from the many floors of the building. On each floor, your fire fighter begins at the bottom of the screen and needs to reach the top where the survivors have taken cover. Blocking your path are numerous (and dangerous) fires. Your fire fighter is equipped with a hose and an unlimited water supply to help you put out the fires. You need to be quick, however, for if you take too long the survivors will die! When you rescue as many survivors as you can and make it back out of the room, the floor is complete and a helicopter will transport you to the next floor. Although it isn't necessary to put out all of the fires on a floor, you will earn bonus points if you do. The higher you get in the building, the tougher the game becomes.

The gopher will be tunneling in the ground at the bottom of the screen; you are at the top and need to fill in the gopher's tunnels with your shovel. The gopher is fast, however, and if you don't fill in the tunnels quick enough, it will make it to the surface and run off with one of your carrots! If the gopher manages to take all of your carrots, the game will be over. From time to time, there will be a duck that flies overhead. As the duck passes by, it will drop a seed; if you catch the seed and plant it, a new carrot will grow to replace one of the ones that was stolen. Several difficulty levels are included, which control the speed and intelligence of the gopher, and whether or not the duck will appear.</p>",

Regardless, Bachelor Party was one of those very few games that was regarded at that time as an Adult Video Game (or at least claimed to be one).</p>\n<p>Bachelor Party is a simple straight-forward pong game but with a wild twist: the objective of the game is help ol'bachelor (read=ball) here get lucky with the ladies by \"hitting\" him with a dose of Spanish Fly (read=paddle, and that's a lot of doses!), hopefully with your help, he'll \"score\" frequently. When each lady is \"hit\", the lady disappears until all 8-16 ladies are \"subdued\" and on to the next level. Looks like someone's gonna be busy tonight.</p>\n<p>The bachelor has 4 lives to start and in order to survive (the night) he has to keep getting a regular dose of Spanish Fly (since without it...you know...) to keep the ladies (and him) happy.</p>\n<p>The game consists of 2 player modes and 4 level modes: Games number 1 and 3 are one-player versions and 2 and 4 are two-player versions. In games 1 and 2 there are two rows of 4 women in each row. Games 3 and 4 are more difficult in that there are two rows of 8 women in each row, and they slowly advance during play (looks like the Spanish Fly is working!).</p>\n<p>One last funny thing is that the bachelor appears to have three arms...<em>ahem</em></p>",

You control a diver at the bottom of the screen, and there is a giant octopus and killer shark you need to deal with. Each time an octopus tentacle touches the bottom of the screen, or the shark catches you some of your treasure will be lost. To deal with these creatures, your diver has a harpoon. You need to make sure that you shoot the shark before it can make it's way to the bottom of the screen and catch you (the shark will appear again at the top of the screen each time it is shot.) The octopus' tentacles will be reaching downward; each time a tentacle is shot it will retreat back to the top so you need to keep shooting the tentacles before one can reach the bottom. Of course, your diver has a limited air supply. Your companion is in a boat on the surface, and will occasionally drop an air line down. You need to catch this to replenish your air before it runs out (if you run out of air, some treasure will be lost). The game ends when you have lost all of your treasure.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Phaser Patrol</em> you are the pilot of an interstellar spaceship on a mission to defend the Human Federation from the deadly Dracon armada. Gameplay is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Star+Raiders\">Star Raiders</a>. You begin with a view of the sector map and need to warp to a sector where the Dracon are located. Once you've reached your destination, the game switches to a first-person point of view where you need to destroy all enemy fighters located in the sector. Once the sector is cleared, you can return to the sector map and warp to a new location. The mission is successful when all sectors containing enemy fighters have been cleared. Your ship has a limited amount of energy; energy is depleted by warping to new sectors, or by taking damage from enemy fighters. If your energy runs out the game is over, however you can recharge your ship by visiting one of the friendly starbases that are located throughout the galaxy (visiting a starbase will also repair any equipment that has been damaged, such as the photon torpedoes or sector scanner). The game is timed, and the faster you can complete your mission the better your ranking at the end will be!</p>",

There are six different puzzles included, which are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Touch Me:</strong> The computer will play a sequence of tones. Each button on the controller represents a different tone, and by pressing the correct button you need to recreate the same sequence.</li>\n<li><strong>Count Me:</strong> The computer will display a sequence of numbers. Using the controller, you need to press the numbered buttons in the same order the computer displayed them.</li>\n<li><strong>Picture Me:</strong> The computer will display a series of symbols. It will then scramble the order they are displayed in, and you need to reorder the symbols back into their original configuration.</li>\n<li><strong>Find Me:</strong> The computer will display a series of objects on the screen, and you need to select the object which is dissimilar from the others. Your score is based on how fast you can successfully do this.</li>\n<li><strong>Add Me:</strong> The computer will display a list of numbers. You need to enter in the sum of the numbers before the timer runs out.</li>\n<li><strong>Play Me:</strong> This game allows you to play your own songs in free form mode; each button on the controller represents a musical note. Both controllers can be used for a duet, and several example songs are included in the instruction manual.</li>\n</ul>",

The evil wizards have decided to attempt to conquer the earth, and have sent numerous waves of creatures to stop all of the good sorcerers. Your goal is to destroy the various creatures! On the beginning screen of the game, there is a flying platform: you need to jump and catch this platform which will allow you to fly anywhere on the screen. Next you will need to fight screen after screen of dangerous creatures by firing an energy charge at them. After you have successfully destroyed the creatures on the current screen, a treasure will be left behind which can be collected for bonus points and then you can move on to the next screen. From time to time, you may also encounter a cloud with deadly lightning bolts that you must avoid! The longer you survive, the faster the enemies become. Two levels of difficulty as well as a practice mode are available.</p>",

Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by collecting treasures and destroying the various enemies you'll encounter. Your mini-sub is equipped with a tractor beam which can be used to collect treasures found along the bottom of the ocean; when you successfully retrieve a treasure, you will then need to carry it safely up to the research vessel on the surface. Your mini-sub is also equipped with lasers which can be used to destroy the many dangers you'll encounter, including giant squids, man-eating sharks, mines, bombs, enemy ships, and more. The game ends when all of your mini-subs have been destroyed, and there are multiple skill levels available.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Open, Sesame!</em> is an action platform game. You control Ali Baba, and your goal is to reach the cave of treasures. The treasury entrance is at the top of the screen, and you begin each level at the bottom and need to climb your way up. To do so, you will need to find a good location where you can throw a rope up to the next platform and climb up (there will be a dot on the platform where you can safely throw a rope, two on each floor). Before the treasury can be entered, you need to attach ropes to each of the possible locations. To hinder your progress, there are guards wandering each of the floors. If you're caught, you'll lose a life! To help out, a magic ball will appear on screen from time to time; if caught, this can be used to temporarily freeze a guard. When you successfully enter the treasury, you then move on to the next level of gameplay. </p>\n<p>The game itself is the same as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/54654/i-want-my-mommy/\">I Want My Mommy</a> except with some graphical alterations.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> is an adventure game which is loosely based on the movie of the same name. In the game you control Indiana Jones on his quest to find the Lost Ark of the Covenant. The ark is hidden somewhere in the valley of poison. Your mission begins in the Egyptian city of Cairo; next you must find your way to the Temple of the Ancients where there is a secret map room. In the map room you will find a hieroglyphic indicating an object you must have to unlock the secrets of the map room; when unlocked, you will be able to find where in the Mesa Field the entrance to the Well of Souls is located. If you can find your way safely across the Mesa tops into the Well of Souls, you will locate the ark and win the game! The game uses two joysticks for control; one joystick moves Indy around the screen and uses a selected object, the second joystick allows you to select and/or drop objects from your inventory. On the many different locations of your journey you will come across different objects (some hidden) which can be collected to help you out. You may find weapons (like a whip or gun) for defense, or objects (such as a key or money) which can be used to unlock new areas or receive help. You begin the game with three lives, and the game ends when all lives are lost. There are plenty of enemies to hinder your progress, and of course numerous snakes!</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Quick Step</em>, a kangaroo and a squirrel are competing against each other to earn points by jumping on trampolines. The screen is made up of an array of trampolines which scroll downward. As trampolines appear at the top of the screen, they will be grey in color; as soon as they turn pink, the trampolines are in play. Each time a critter jumps on a trampoline, the color will change to their own color (green for the kangaroo, or blue for the squirrel). Jumping on a pink trampoline gives 3 points; a trampoline of your own color gives 6 points when it falls off the bottom of the screen (so although no points are earned by jumping on your opponent's color, you want to try to get as many trampolines of your color as possible in order to earn points when they reach the bottom).\nIf you fall off of the bottom of the screen, a life is lost; the game ends when one player has no more lives left and whomever has more points wins. A few bonuses can also be found; if you see a white trampoline, that is a magic hat; collect it and then jump onto the same space as your opponent to temporarily stun him. Each player also begins the game with 6 tricky traps; pressing the button lays a trap causing the trampoline to disappear so no one can land there.\nEach level in the game gets progressively faster; at the end of a level, there will be a single column of fast moving trampolines to jump up, so be careful!</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Solar Storm</em> is an arcade style action game where you control a spaceship to defend your home planet. Deadly Deltoid ships will be flying in trying to destroy your planet; in addition to this danger, a far off sun has exploded sending debris towards you. Your job is to shoot everything that is heading your way before it reaches your planet (the bottom of the screen). Each time an enemy ship or some debris makes it past you, your planets shield absorbs the energy and heats up; if it overheats, it will be destroyed and the game ends. If your laser ship crashes into any incoming danger, you lose a life (the game also ends if all lives are lost). Every 500 points there is a bonus screen where you have a chance to earn more lives. The longer you last, the faster the game will become.</p>",

When a Fury is hit by a brick it is destroyed, but if you accidentally hit a Fury with a stone then it will multiply! The Furies will also be firing at you, and you'll lose a life if hit.

You can move the ladder to the appropriate floor of the building to climb up and rescue the trapped worker. Depending on which floors have caught fire, the worker will move to the lowest floor he can which isn't burning; you'll need to estimate which floor he'll be on when you position the ladder. Once the worker is safe, you move on to the next (more challenging) level. The fire in the building may spread quickly! If necessary, you can use a fire hose to put out the fire. Of course, you have a limited supply of water so make sure you don't run out! As the levels progress, the building becomes shorter and the fire spreads faster which means you don't have as much time in which to rescue the trapped victims.</p>",

You can choose to play pool (first player to 25 points wins), billiards (first player to 50 points wins), trickshot (attempt to earn points by sinking all of the balls on the table in a single shot), or trickshot practice game variations. During the game you use the joystick to control a cursor which aims the cue ball. By holding down the button you control the amount of power in a shot (the longer you hold down the button, the more power the cue ball is hit with). You may also apply some \"English\" (spin) by moving the joystick while hitting the cue ball. At the end of the game a trophy will appear on screen to indicate who the winner is!</p>",

Failsafe detonators inside the cryptic computer have malfunctioned, and your job is to pilot a spaceship to destroy them before they explode. The narrow passage you'll need to fly through is well guarded: deadly force fields appear and disappear, rocket launchers attack, and deadly byte bats will get in your way. Your ship has a limited shield; each time you are hit by one of these enemies, the shield loses energy. When the shield's energy is completely gone, the game ends. Also be on the lookout for energy pods which can replenish the shield (these don't appear often, so be sure not to miss one)! To deal with some of the enemies and obstacles your ship is equipped with a laser. Naturally, your mission is timed: you will need to make your way to the next detonator before time expires and it explodes! Points are earned by disabling the detonators, destroying enemies and successfully making it past the force fields.</p>",

When you reach the last level of the cavern, you can collect the treasure crystal and be transported to the next (more challenging) set of caves and try for another crystal. In addition to the deadly aerobots, be sure not to crash into cave walls; these will drain your energy rapidly, especially if you hit one of the skulls.

        "description": "<p><em>Dragonstomper</em> is notable for being the first role-playing game (RPG) released for a home console.</p>\n<p>Long ago, a Druid magician created an amulet of great power that could subdue a dragon. Heading to the dragon's lair, the Druid accidentally dropped the amulet and it fell deep into its lair. Over time, the amulet imbued the dragon with cunning and power so that it began to spread treachery and evil about the peaceful Kingdom. The player's quest begins with the king summoning the player to defeat the dragon once and for all. Taking up the call to arms, the player begins by gathering their strength and fighting creatures in the enchanted countryside to build up enough power to become a Dragonstomper. When finally ready, the player moves on to an oppressed village near the dragon's lair in order to recruit soldiers, buy magical scrolls, and acquire medicines and elixirs needed to face the dragon in its lair. With all of his skills, training, equipment, and soldiers, the Dragonstomper descends into the dragon's lair for a final combat to bring peace to the Kingdom.</p>\n<p>The combat in the game is turn-based; enemies might appear randomly and attack the playable character. Mercenaries can join the party and engage in combat, controlled by the AI. Many locations have traps which should be detected and avoided. Certain situations in the game can be approached in various ways, leading to different solutions to the problems.</p>",

You control the space ship Star Voyager from a first person perspective; your objective is to make your way through seven star portals to save the Capital Starport, destroying enemy ships along the way. On each level there will be multiple enemies to destroy; typically they appear first in the distance, then close in slowly while firing torpedoes at you. Using the Star Voyager's weapons (either lasers or photon torpedoes) you need to destroy the enemies before they destroy you. Once a star portal appears, you need to navigate your way through to reach the next level (don't crash into the portal walls, you'll be destroyed!). In addition to the main viewport, the bottom of the screen also contains a status bar which shows the number of enemies destroyed, your energy level, and a scanner to help locate enemies.</p>\n<p>Two player game variations are also included; in these one player controls Star Voyager, and the other player can choose to either control Star Voyager's weapons or the enemy ships.</p>",

You control a gun at the bottom of the screen while various types of targets move left and right above. Given a limited amount of ammo, you need to earn as many points as possible by shooting the targets (which include trains, snails, frogs, kangaroos, monkeys, and more). Naturally more points are awarded for targets that are further away or tougher to hit. At the top of the screen is a cuckoo clock which counts down; when time runs out, a cuckoo will eat some of your remaining ammo! To avoid this, the clock can be shot which resets the timer. Every 20,000 points bonus ammo is awarded. When all of your ammo is gone, the game is over and the score calculated.</p>",

You move the target reticle by moving the joystick and fire weapons by pressing the red button. You can see the ships coming in the distance but if they get too close they will fire on you, causing you to lose energy. If you see a force field, you will see a square to the right. Shoot the square to disable the field. If your ship hits the field, you lose energy. You gain energy when you destroy a ship or disable a force field. Use the map on the top of your screen to determine which path to take, left or right. If you choose the wrong path or run out of energy, the game is over.</p>",

Another feature lets you decide to make the missiles faster or slower than the car, or in some variants the missile would be stopped when it hit any walls. The difficulty switch determines whether you can shoot a missile while one of your own is still on the screen. Otherwise, your missile has to hit the enemy or be retrieved by your vehicle before you can launch another one.</p>\n<p>You steer your car with a joystick. Each time you hit your enemy with a missile, you get a point. The first player to get 25 points is the winner.</p>",

Because <em>Tunnel Runner</em> was designed with a built-in expanded memory chip (RAM Plus!), it's 12KB of memory gives it the ability to present the maze in three dimensions. Therefore, the playfield is a colorful, three-dimensional maze, so you never see yourself... just the walls on either side of you that form the corridors you travel along. As you move along the passage-ways, additional tunnels appear on either side, which you can turn into by pressing left and right.</p>\n<p>Your primary goal is to locate and collect the hidden key, located in a different spot within each maze. Through the assistance of a MAP, you can maneuver within the maze. While attempting to locate the key to exit the level, you must also avoid the hungry Zot\u2019s. You will discover these enemy creatures throughout the maze. Successfully recovering the key without being intercepted by the Zot's opens the portal to the next level. As you pass each level, you will discover that the complexity and difficulty increases, while your MAP gradually reveals less and less information\u2026 ultimately, your map will be of little use, requiring you to survive solely by instincts and quick thinking!</p>",

        "description": "<p>You are a bank robber, driving around a maze of streets (representing the city) in a 1930's style car. Your purpose is clear: perform \"bank heists\" by driving across white-pillared symbols that represent banks. As you \"rob\" each of the banks, they disappear, and a police car appears in its place, beginning hot pursuit after a few moments. You must avoid the cops to stay alive. Fortunately you are not completely defenseless, as you have a stock of dynamite, which you can strategically drop to destroy the cop cars.</p>\n<p>Besides the escape tunnel that will take you from one side of the screen to another (as in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a>), there is an additional tunnel that represents the road out of town. By taking it, you will find yourself in the next city. Each city is increasingly difficult, and the cop cars are faster and smarter.</p>\n<p>There are 9 banks in each town, and you receive an increase in gasoline each time you rob one. Therefore, the goal of the game is to drive from town to town, navigating the mazes of streets, and robbing as many of the banks in each town as you are able to. This keeps your gas supply high, and the money rolling in! If you run out of gas, the game is over.</p>",

As a pitcher, you use the joystick to throw the ball and to control its speed and curve. After the ball is hit, you control all your men (they all move together since they follow the orders of a single joystick) in the field to catch the ball. As a batter, you can control the position of the baseball bat with the joystick. If you consider that your runners would make it to the next base, you can press the controller button so they stop at their current base. </p>\n<p>The rest of the rules are basically like real baseball. Each team has nine innings in a game. You are out after three strikes, you get to first base after four balls (balls that do not fly over Home) or if the pitcher hits you with a ball. In the field, you can put out a batter by catching his ball, then another runner by reaching his next base before him or simply by touching him between bases, thus completing a double play. The only way to accomplish a home run is by hitting the ball over second base without having it caught by the field players. You score a point for each runner that reaches Home base after each of the first three.</p>",

You must get Big Bird under the correct chute to catch the egg.</p>\n<p>Game one is one player only. Games two through ten are one or two player. All games have two rounds.</p>\n<p>Game one is a practice round. There are two chickens, straight chutes and when you move Big Bird left or right, he pops right under the chute.</p>\n<p>Games two and three have three then four chutes and the game gets faster in the second round. Game two's chutes are straight, game three's zig-zag. Big Bird still pops under a chute.</p>\n<p>Games four, five and six have three rounds. There will be eleven white eggs dropped and one golden egg. Games four starts with two zig-zagging chutes in the first round and four in the second. Game five has two crisscrossing chutes in the first round, four in the second. Game six has four crisscrossing chutes in both rounds. Big Bird  no longer pops under the chute but must be positioned correctly.</p>\n<p>Games seven has eleven white eggs and one golden egg dropping per round with unlimited rounds. There are five broken eggs on the bottom left and you do rounds until you miss so many eggs you are out of broken eggs. when you catch the golden egg, in addition to points, you get an extra broken egg.</p>\n<p>Game eight is the same as game seven except you can't see an egg in the chute, only when it pops out the bottom.</p>\n<p>Games nine and ten are the same as game seven but the chutes shrink up in the direction of the hens. This means you must memorize when the chute comes out for which chicken. In game nine, the chutes are all the same for each round. In game ten, the patterns change per round.</p>\n<p>Each white egg caught is worth one point, each golden egg, five.</p>\n<p>For ages three to seven.</p>",

Press the button on the controller for that can the use the arrow keys to move it to the trash. Once you get the trash, move the grouch back to the top. You get one point per race.

You have to catch these in you basket. Once you have caught one of each of the other symbols, then the heart (representing love) comes down. You MUST catch the heart to end the round and go to the next round. If you miss the heart, you lose a life.</p>\n<p>Just under the Music Machine is Mr. Pims. He tries to mess you up by dropping down his assistants, the Pudgeons. If you catch a Pudgeon, you lose a life.</p>\n<p>The symbols and what they represent are:  </p>\n<p>Heart=Love  </p>\n<p>Snail=Patience  </p>\n<p>Lamb=Gentleness  </p>\n<p>Mustard Seed=Faith  </p>\n<p>Music Note=Joy  </p>\n<p>Harp=Peace  </p>\n<p>Gift=Kindness  </p>\n<p>Angel=Goodness  </p>\n<p>Stop Sign=Self-control</p>\n<p>The points vary per level.

You have only one year to get your money and invest it. Each second, a day goes by. My, how time flies.</p>\n<p>Once a season, you are sent to the investment/tax shelter screen, where you must collect an icon representing an investment and then grab your portfolio (briefcase). Investments have a 50/50 chance of making or losing money. Also on this screen is a character whose color changes.</p>\n<p>What color he is determines who he is:  </p>\n<p>Black=Eggie, the IRS agent. If he catches you, he will audit you. In these audits, you always lose. You are then taxed at 50% of your income and sent back to the income screen.There are no appeals to tax court.  </p>\n<p>Pink=Waggie, the CPA. If he catches you (or you go to him), he will charge you $1,000.00 but whatever tax sheltered investment you have, he will put you in a better one.  </p>\n<p>Green=Toodles, the registered investment adviser. If you two meet, he will put you in the best tax sheltered investment available, thus making you the most profit.</p>\n<p>After each season, you are taxed to an amount determined by your tax shelter. The object is to have $1,000,000.00 at the end of the year after taxes.</p>",

They then begin haphazardly making their nest.</p>\n<p>Using your probe ship, you must destroy the termites and their nest blocks. You simply fire at the termites to destroy them but their nest blocks must be energized before you can destroy them. To energize a nest block, you must hit a block while a termite is still carrying it. This will energize all the blocks on the screen.</p>\n<p>If you shoot a termite that is not carrying a block or if one is carrying a block but you only hit the termite, all the blocks will not be energized and not be damageable. If you run into a block, energized or not, or are touched by a termite, you lose a life.</p>\n<p>Every so often, a refuel ship travels down and then back up the left or right side of the screen. You must dock with it (touch it) before it gets back to the top or the game ends, no matter how many lives you have left.</p>\n<p>To fire, press the fire button. To move, move the joystick while the button is not pressed. If you hold down the button, you can rotate left or right then you will stay at that angle until you rotate again.</p>\n<p>The points are:  </p>\n<p>Shooting a termite that is NOT carrying a block=1 point  </p>\n<p>Shooting a termite that is carrying a block but only hitting the termite=2 points  </p>\n<p>Shooting a termite that is carrying a block and hitting the block=3 points  </p>\n<p>Shooting an energized block=1 point</p>",

You current glass of water will then be refilled then it is off to the next fire.</p>\n<p>Of course, it is not that easy. You must jump over rocks and logs, duck under stones, arrows and tomahawks, and avoid hitting trees or touching the sides of the gauntlet. You can ease the thirst of the old men you come across for points but it will cost you water. The game is over when you run out of your third glass of water. To jump, just press the fire button. To duck, pull back then press the fire button.</p>\n<p><strong>Scoring:</strong>  </p>\n<p>Jump over a rock or a log=50 points  </p>\n<p>Duck under an arrow, stone or tomahawk=100 points  </p>\n<p>Give an old man a drink of water=250 points  </p>\n<p>Duck under the Secret Talisman=500 points  </p>\n<p>Extinguish the ceremonial flame=500 points</p>\n<p><strong>Difficulty switches</strong>  </p>\n<p>Left switch:  </p>\n<p>A=joystick less responsive, more challenging  </p>\n<p>B=joystick more responsive, less challenging  </p>\n<p>Right switch:  </p>\n<p>A=jumping and ducking more difficult  </p>\n<p>B=jumping and ducking less difficult</p>",

As such, the rules for acey deucey will vary from ship to ship and person to person.

        "description": "<p>Now it's time for...PIIIIIIGS IN SPAAAAACE!!!</p>\n<p>This game is really three smaller games. You select what to play to choosing which character you want.<br>\nFor Captain Link Hogthrob, it is Chickenvaders. A Pigs in Space take in Atari's Atari 2600 version of <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-2600/space-invaders-\">Space Invaders</a>.\nWhile exploring the planet Cluck, our intrepid hero was set upon by space chickens. Captain Link must destroy them before they make their way all the way to the planet. He does this by firing link sausages up at the chickens. But the chickens are not helpless. They are dropping space chicken eggs. If one hits Link, he will be turned into...a chicken! You also lose a life. From time to time, Gonzo flies across the screen top in his saucer. You can hit him for points also.</p>\n<p><strong>Scoring</strong>  </p>\n<p>Hitting a chicken on...  </p>\n<p>Row one=10 points  </p>\n<p>Row two=20 points  </p>\n<p>Row three=50 points  </p>\n<p>Row four=70 points  </p>\n<p>Row five=100 points  </p>\n<p>Hitting Gonzo=300 points  </p>\n<p>Destroying all the chickens=1000 point bonus</p>\n<p>If you select First Mate Piggy, you play Pastaroids. Somehow, Piggy has been ejected from the Swinetrek into a pastaroid storm. You must guide Piggy from the bottom of the screen to the top and board the Swinetrek before it leaves. If you touch a flying meatball or spaghetti strand, you will lose ground, and thus time. You can press fire to give a meat ball a karate chop for points but don't dawdle.</p>\n<p><strong>Scoring</strong>  </p>\n<p>Karate-chopping a meat ball=100 points  </p>\n<p>Boarding the Swinetrek=1000 points</p>\n<p>If you select Dr. Strangepork, you play Escape from Planet of the Gonzoids. The Swinetrek has gotten trapped in an abandoned pizza mine still being guarded by robotic Gonzoids, created by Gonzo. The Gonzoids are standing on ledges, throwing pizzas across the mine, You have a weapon called the Boomeray. When you fire, it goes up then curves to the side, hopefully landing on a Gonzoid. The direction it curves depends on which way you move before you fire. If you are hit by a pizza, hit the mine walls or are hit by your dropping Boomeray shot, you lose a life.</p>\n<p><strong>Scoring</strong>  </p>\n<p>You get one point for every mile you get through the mine.  </p>\n<p>Hitting a Gonzoid=100 points  </p>\n<p>Escaping the mine=1000 points</p>\n<p>The difficulty switches do nothing. The only game selections are one player or two player, alternating.</p>",

It is up to you to destroy the stations by setting their self destructs.</p>\n<p>You move from room to room, fighting any enemies you encounter. When you beat an enemy, you get an energy pod or oxygen bottle. Fighting aliens depletes you energy and/or oxygen so kill quickly. Each weapon inflicts different damage, and depletes a different amount of energy. As a rule, the stronger a weapon is, the more energy it requires. You also use oxygen at the rate of one bottle per minute while exploring. Along the way, you will sometimes find sonic keys, and energy sword, sonic blaster or particle beam. Sonic keys are needed for certain doors you encounter in later stations.</p>\n<p>Once you set the self destruct code, a clock starts and you must make it to the teleporter before the time runs out. The game ends when you destroy all eight stations, run out of oxygen or do not get off a station before it self destructs. If you run out of energy, the game does not end but you will not be able to use any weapon so you can't kill monsters so you can't replenish oxygen. Hence, the game won't go long if you run out of energy. </p>\n<p>Defeating enemies rewards the player with points. These can range from 50 points awarded for a bear trap, to 750 points earned by slaying a mighty dragon.</p>",

The game controls are identical. The alterations are that the graphics and colors were changed. Also, the options were reduced to one or two player and whether, in one player, the human player is up first at bat or not.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, everything else is the same. You still can throw fastballs, curve balls, sinkers, etc. and you can still bunt, hit fly balls, etc. Scoring remains the same with a tie after nine innings going into extra innings. The difficulty switches do not have any use.</p>",

You must destroy all three power generators to escape. One generator is hidden until the other two are destroyed.</p>\n<p>IT is protected by three shields above you; which are A, B, and C, from top to bottom. There is a forth shield, D, below you. Touching any shield is instant game over. IT also has guided fireballs that chase your ship for a short distance. Getting hit by these too many times will kill you. If you can avoid getting hit long enough, your repair crew might can undo some of the damage (see Game variations below)</p>\n<p>You use the joystick to move the ship, left, right, up or down. Press the fire button to launch a torpedo. If you keep the fire button down, you can guide the torpedo left or right or accelerate it. Be advised, though, that your ship isn't moving while you are guiding the torpedo and could get damaged or destroyed.</p>\n<p>As you damage IT's generators, shields A, B, and C will get invulnerable sections. These move across the shields, making it harder to get shots through the longer you play. If you do not hit the left or right generators for 15 seconds, IT will lower shield C, reducing your maneuvering room. You will also lose points (see Scoring below).</p>\n<p>After you destroy the left and right generators, the center generator will be visible. When you destroy that, you win the game. However, as you hit the center generator, shield D will raise so you must work fast as possible.</p>\n<p>You start with six ships at the bottom of the screen. Each time a fireball hits you, you lose a ship. Lose them all and the game is over.</p>\n<p><strong>Game variations</strong>  </p>\n<p>After you press the fire button to select your joystick, you then choose your difficulty by moving the joystick up or down.</p>\n<p>The difficulty settings are:  </p>\n<p>Easy (the square)=Fireball firing rate is slow, invulnerable shield segments are small, you have a repair crew.  </p>\n<p>Normal (the X)=Fireball firing rate is normal, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you have a repair crew.  </p>\n<p>Hard (the diamond)=Fireball firing rate is fast, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you do not have a repair crew. That means any lost ships from fireball strikes are never regained.</p>\n<p>The difficulty switches are not used.\nAfter you have the setting you want, move the joystick to the right to begin the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Scoring</strong>  </p>\n<p>Readiness=Every few seconds, you get 1 point for each ship at the bottom of the screen, up to a maximum of 6.  </p>\n<p>Damage=The number of hits to a generator multiplied by ten. For instance, the first hit is 10 points, the 7th hit is 70 points, the 12th hit is 120 points, etc.  </p>\n<p>Destroy the left or right generator=2000 points  </p>\n<p>Destroy the center generator=5000 points  </p>\n<p>Shield C lowers=lose 90 points, although your score will never be lower than zero.</p>",

The ship controls in a rather <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/asteroids_\">Asteroids</a>-like way, in that you push left or right to rotate and press fire to thrust. Once you stop thrusting, the ship does not immediately stop, although it will slow down on its own. To stop sooner, you have to face away from the direction you are traveling and thrust.</p>\n<p>First, you must pass a set number of hurdles. If there is a single hurdle, you must pass on the side indicated by the arrow. If there are two hurdles, you must pass in between them. If there are three, you can pass through them or go around. If you hit a hurdle, you must go back to the last successfully passed hurdle and do it again to continue.</p>\n<p>After the hurdles, you must pop ten space balloons by running in to them. They appear one at a time at random spots on the screen. After you pop all ten balloons, you must dock in the space dock to end the race.</p>\n<p>The difficulty switches are not used. You select your game variation by moving the joystick up or down.</p>\n<p><strong>Game variations</strong>  </p>\n<p>There are 28 variations. The odd numbered ones have fast maneuvering, the even numbered ones, slow.</p>\n<p>The number of hurdles also varies. The first two have 10 hurdles, the next two, 14, then 22 (twice), 27 (twice), 35 (twice), 39 (four times), 47 (twice), 51 (twice), 54 (twice), 63 (twice), 64 (twice), 72 (twice), and 82 (twice).</p>",

Unfortunately, a comet passed near Earth and left a space debris field that you will need to avoid.</p>\n<p>After the launch, you will see the Earth being circled but four colored dots. At the bottom will be the elapsed time, remaining fuel and four indicator bars. These bars are your orbit altitudes and their colors correspond to the colors of the orbiting dots: white for the shuttle, gold for the station, red for the orbiting factory, and green for the fuel depot.</p>\n<p>When you are lower in orbit than an item, you move faster. If you are higher than an item, you move slower. You must match orbit and location with something to dock. Once you are close to something, you switch to the maneuvering display. Now you can interact with an item or avoid it, as in the debris. If you hit something, whether debris or man-made orbiting item, you begin to leak fuel. This means you will use fuel even if you are not firing thrusters. You also have a 25% chance to damage the part in the cargo hold.</p>\n<p><strong>Game variations</strong>  </p>\n<p>The difficulty switches and select switch are not used. After you press fire on the joystick, move the stick up or down to select the difficulty level, from 0 to 3.

After the notes play, they fall to the ground and you must put them in their correct spots. The highest level has invisible notes, you must match by sound only.</p>\n<p>There are two modes, changed by the select switch.\nIn <strong>Game Mode</strong>, the computer plays and you must duplicate it. In <strong>Toy Mode</strong>, there are six notes on the ground and you can make any tune you like, the computer doesn't create a tune.</p>\n<p>With Handy Smurf, items will move along a conveyor belt and you must sort them into one of three bins. You press the button to close or open gaps to guide the object but don't press too soon or the gap returns to the way it was before after a short time.</p>\n<p>In <strong>Game Mode</strong>, the first five items are sorted by shape, the next five by size and the next five by color then the sequence repeats only faster. In <strong>Toy Mode</strong>, after each item is sorted, the sorting criteria (shape, size or color) changes randomly.</p>\n<p>With Greedy Smurf, Clumsy Smurf has a colored liquid in a glass. Using blue, red, yellow and white spigots, Greedy must put the same color liquid or mix liquids to get the same color in his glass. If he gets it right, he and Clumsy drink up. If he gets it wrong, the glass drains out.</p>\n<p>In <strong>Game Mode</strong>, the colors start easy and get progressively harder. In <strong>Toy Mode</strong>, the color selection in Clumsy's glass is random.</p>\n<p>There is no time limit or penalty if you get something wrong.</p>",

        "description": "<p>You are the last mining robot on the Minos mine. Monsters have destroyed all your comrades.</p>\n<p>As the last robot, you must traverse the mine's various levels, gathering spare parts to make more robots (extra lives). You must either avoid the monsters or blow them up with a bomb. After a few seconds, if the monster hasn't hit the bomb, it will explode harmlessly. You can only drop one bomb at a time. If a monster is killed, it will regenerate somewhere in the maze.</p>\n<p>To deposit your spare parts, you must get to the center top or bottom of any level. To move to another level, hold your joystick button down while moving through the tunnels on either side. You can also use these tunnels, without holding down the button, to quickly get from left or right side of the maze to avoid monsters.</p>\n<p>To win the game, get to level five and ram each of the three stationary monsters to kill them. You will need at least two spare robots as the ramming will destroy you and the monster.</p>\n<p>In two player games, player one is the robot, player two is a monster. If the robot runs into the monster being controlled, the monster is destroyed instead of the robot. However, by pushing the joystick button, player two can switch to another monster, allowing the robot to run into an uncontrolled (and therefore deadly) monster.</p>\n<p><strong>Difficulty switches</strong>  </p>\n<p>Left switch for the robot, right for the monsters.  </p>\n<p>Set to A to make half speed, B for normal speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Game variations</strong>  </p>\n<p>1P=one player  </p>\n<p>2P=two player  </p>\n<p>S=spare parts needed for spare robot  </p>\n<p>F=mine levels flood, slowing you down if you enter the water.  </p>\n<p>-T=cannot drop bombs in flooded areas  </p>\n<p>+T=can drop bombs in flooded areas  </p>\n<p>I-mines are invisible except when monsters are exploding by time bomb</p>\n<p>Game 1 1P; S=3; F-T  </p>\n<p>Game 2 2P; S=3; F-T  </p>\n<p>Game 3 1P; S=6; F-T  </p>\n<p>Game 4 2P; S=6; F-T  </p>\n<p>Game 5 1P; S=3  </p>\n<p>Game 6 2P; S=3  </p>\n<p>Game 7 1P; S=2; F-T  </p>\n<p>Game 8 2P; S=2; F-T  </p>\n<p>Game 9 1P; S=3; F+T  </p>\n<p>Game 10 1P; S=3; F+T  </p>\n<p>Game 11 1P; S=3; F+T; I  </p>\n<p>Game 12 2P; S=3; F+T; I</p>\n<p><strong>Scoring</strong>  </p>\n<p>Destroy a monster=20 points  </p>\n<p>Pick up robot part=70 points  </p>\n<p>Deposit robot part=lose 70 points  </p>\n<p>Every 1000 points scored up to 4000 raises your power level by one unit.</p>",

Sometimes the death ship takes a dive towards your base, firing as it goes. If it reaches your base, it will destroy your generator, losing you a life.</p>\n<p>As hordes of Megalyte ships descend, you can hold down the fire button.

If you are in danger of being shot or need to destroy a death ship, just release the button and then you can move the launcher left or right.</p>\n<p>There are 26 game variations.

There you must prevent him from completing his creation.</p>\n<p>Your only chance is to gather stones from the dungeon and bring them to the tower where you must build a barricade around the monster before he has accumulated enough energy to come alive.</p>\n<p>You start at the top floor of the castle and must make your way to the dungeon to get a stone to wall in the monster, all the while avoiding ghosts, giant tarantulas, trapdoors, spiders and a pool of acid. Once you have the stone, you must make your way back to the top, again avoiding these obstacles. When you get near the monster, you switch to a new screen where you must make your way past bats to place the stone. You must do this four times and each time gets harder, with more ghosts, more and bigger tarantulas, and a harder to cross acid pool.</p>\n<p>You have three lives and falling into the acid pool will lose you one. You are also timed (see Difficulty settings) and you are trying to get and not lose points.</p>\n<p><strong>Game variations</strong>  </p>\n<p>The only variation is one or two players</p>\n<p><strong>Difficulty switches</strong>  </p>\n<p>Left for player one, right for player two  </p>\n<p>Set to A for a five minute timer.

        "description": "<p>This is a game rather reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Q*Bert\">Q*bert</a>.</p>\n<p>In this game, you are a bubble named, with great originality, Bubble.\nThe object here is to bounce on each of the thirty-six squares and turn them all on. You start at the bottom left. On the bottom right starts the Bubble Eater. He will chase you around the play field and if he catches you, you lose one of your five lives. Pin starts at the top of a row and moves down. If you are hit by Pin, you pop and a life is lost.</p>\n<p>The good thing about Pin, other than that it doesn't actively chase you, is that if it lands on the Bubble Eater, it will pop it, too.

The player, controlling a female, must collect some money from the bank and then make their way to the houses for sex she pays these men for. Once the money is in hand, the player has to avoid the thief who is out to rob all that cash. The game will end if the thief succeeds.</p>\n<p>After the woman is finished having intercourse with a man, she has to try to avoid or outrun the police. If she is arrested three times, the game is over. To run, move while holding down the button. It's best the player doesn't make her run everywhere or the police will chase you, thinking she is up to something.</p>\n<p>The lady earns one point for each pelvic thrust she experiences from a male.</p>",

You then lower your erected penis to the woman who holds on to it with her mouth while you fly her to safety. You must do this all while avoiding the rocks thrown at you.

        "description": "<p>This is a version of Scrabble for the Atari 2600.</p>\n<p>The letters on the top row are shuffled and then you use them to make words on the bottom row. If the bottom row shows all spaces in pink or red, then the points for the word are doubled or tripled, respectively. If there is a light blue or blue line under a space, then the points for that letter are doubled or tripled, respectively. After you create a word, move down to the E button and press the red joystick button one time. This stops the timer so you can confirm the word is acceptable. If the word is acceptable, press the button again to collect points and go to the next round. If not, move to the P button to pass on the word and go to the next round. In a two player game, after you press the E button once, the other player then must press the button again to enter the word. Play continues until you have 14 rounds in a one player game or 7 each in a two player game.</p>\n<p><strong>Difficulty switches</strong>  </p>\n<p>Use the left switch to set the number of players; B for one player, A for two.</p>\n<p><strong>Game variations</strong>  </p>\n<p>There are five games, each with five skill levels.  </p>\n<p>The skill levels differ by the amount of time you have to make words.  </p>\n<p>Skill levels for one player games:  </p>\n<p>Skill level 1=unlimited time (no clock)  </p>\n<p>Skill level 2=132 seconds  </p>\n<p>Skill level 3=39 seconds  </p>\n<p>Skill level 4=26 seconds  </p>\n<p>Skill level 5=random times  </p>\n<p>For two player games, the times are half of what they are in one player.</p>\n<p>The games are:  </p>\n<p><em>Game 1 (Billboard)</em>: After each round, all the letters are reshuffled, so you get a whole new set of seven letters. Any letters that were not used go back into the mix.  </p>\n<p><em>Game 2 (Skill Builder)</em>: Only the letters you used to make the word are replaced. Any unused letters stay on the top spaces.  </p>\n<p><em>Game 3 (Times Up)</em>: You are given seven letters only. You must use these seven to make as many words as you can.  </p>\n<p><em>Game 4 (Encore)</em>: The letters on the top row all shift to the right, with the last letter disappearing and a new letter plopping into the first spot. You must grab you letters and place them quickly. Any letters the you don't use will reappear randomly again.  </p>\n<p><em>Game 5 (Over the Edge)</em>: Same as game 4 but letters that disappear never return.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This is an Atari 2600 version of a Star Trek game found on many college mainframes.</p>\n<p>Like those mainframe programs, it has no graphics, only text. You use the joystick, moving left or right, to select the command you want then press the red button. You then move the joystick left or right to select set the parameters of that command, if there are any. You start by pressing Reset or Select to choose how many enemies you must kill in how many stardates. </p>\n<p>The commands and any settings are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong><em>Galaxy Map</em></strong>=a 6x6 grid that starts out empty until you do a long range scan. Afterwards, the quadrants will show a 2 digit number. The left digit is the number of aliens in the area. The right digit will either be a 1 or a zero, depending on whether there is or is not a starbase in that area. Galaxy map costs you no energy or stardates.</p>\n<p><strong><em>LR Scan</em></strong>=Long range scan. This will tell you what is in your quadrant and all the quadrants next to yours. If there are any enemies in your quadrant when you do an LR scan, they will attack you. LR scan does not cost energy or stardates but it does take a turn.</p>\n<p><strong><em>SR Scan</em></strong>=Short range scan. This shows you the stars, aliens and starbases in your quadrant. You need to do this to destroy aliens and dock with starbases. Like LR Scan, if there are aliens in your quadrant, they will attack after you use SR Scan. Also, like LR Scan, SR Scan does not cost energy or stardates but it does take a turn.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Warp</em></strong>=Warp is how you move, either from quadrant to quadrant or from sector to sector within a quadrant. You move by setting 2 settings. The first is your direction. You select a direction based on the numbers below:  </p>\n<p><code>**8 1 2\n \\ | /\n7--\\*--3\n / | \\\n6 5 4**</code></p>\n<p>Next, you select how many quadrants and sectors to move. If you want to move within a quadrant, set the left number to zero so you don't warp out of that quadrant. Warp uses stardates, energy and a turn. If you warp into a quadrant that has only you and stars, the screen will be green. If you warp into a quadrant with aliens or aliens and a starbase, the screen will be red. If you warp into a quadrant with just the starbase, the screen will be gray. You cannot warp through stars. If you try, you lose the stardate and energy but don't go anywhere.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Photon Torpedo</em></strong>=If you hit an enemy with one of these, just one shot kills them. You select the direction with the same numbers as warp. there must be a clear line of sight between you and the enemy; no stars. You carry up to 9 torpedoes and they can be replenished. Photon torpedoes do not cost energy or time, just a turn.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Phasers</em></strong>=Unlike photon torpedoes, you do not need to be directly in line of the enemy or tell the game where to fire. You just set how strong you want the blast to be, via a three digit number, and the computer fires. The closer you are to the enemy, the harder you hit. Phasers use the amount of energy from you as you fired. You also use a turn.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Status</em></strong>=A status report. This will tell you how many stardates, aliens, energy units and photon torpedoes are left and whether you have taken damage and to what. If you have taken damage, you will see a negative number next to the damaged item. This is how many stardates it will take to repair the item on your own. You cannot leave the quadrant if your engines are damaged. Instead, you must try to warp the number of quadrants that would take that much time. You won't go anywhere but you will repair.</p>\n<p>If you dock at a starbase, you are instantly repaired of all damage, refueled and torpedoes are restocked. Starbases are placed randomly in the galaxy and never move or get destroyed. There are always two per galaxy. To dock, warp to the quadrant and sector where the base is, so you over the top of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill (Difficulty) switches</strong>  </p>\n<p>The right switch controls how easily you take damage. In the Expert (A) position, your chance of taking damage is twice as likely as in the Novice (B) position.  </p>\n<p>The left switch controls phaser strength. In the Novice (B) position, your phasers are twice as strong as the aliens'. In the Expert (A) position, your phasers are the same strength as the aliens'.</p>",

The player controls the titular X-Man, whose mind is focused on sex to the point of ignoring all danger. His objective is to make his way through a random maze, avoiding either crabs, scissors, or teeth, to get to the woman behind the door in the middle of the maze. The player has 90 seconds to get there.</p>\n<p>Once the intrepid hero reaches his \"goal\", the player enters a so-called \"Sexy Surprise\" mode, which is a simple sex simulation mini-game that lasts until the woman reaches orgasm. Clearly contradictory to most comparable real-life situations, the player has only 30 seconds to satisfy her; then it is off to the next maze.</p>\n<p>The player receives points equivalent to the amount of time remaining after X-man reaches the maze center. Points are also awarded for each increment of the sexual excitement meter.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This game was designed to help teach children addition, subtraction and counting. Eli needs to return to his spaceship. You move him up the ladder by solving addition or subtraction problems. A problem appears with four answer choices below. Move the joystick left or right to select your answer then press the button. After 20 questions, Eli reaches his ship. If you got 18 or more answers correct, Eli will jump for joy and there will be a flashing word WOW.</p>\n<p>The child always uses the right joystick. In two player settings, the left joystick is used by the parent to advance to the next problem, start the game and count apples. In one player, you advance automatically.</p>\n<p>The left difficulty switch is used to select one or two player. The right difficulty switch is used to select addition or subtraction. These must be selected at the main menu before you begin your game. The game select switch returns you to the main menu if you are in a game or changes the game number on the main menu. The TV Type switch switches in and out of the counting screen in a game or set the speed of the pacer (timer) on the main menu.</p>\n<p>There are three types of games, each with up to ten difficulty levels. In game type one, called <em>Practice</em>, there is no time limit. The child can take as long as needed to answer the problem. In game type two, called <em>Pacer</em>, there will be a plus or minus sign at the bottom that moves from left to right. If it reaches the right side barrier, the problem is marked as wrong then it is on to the next problem. You can set the pacer speed from the main menu with the TY Type switch. If your difficulty level allows for counting, when you switch to the counting apples screen, the timer stops and when you return, it resets. In game type three, called <em>Phantom</em>, in addition to having a time limit, the only answer selection that shows is the one that the arrow is under.</p>",

When you destroy a saucer or beacon, do not remain in the same place as the debris will collide with you.

Ordinarily, a computer controls the defense systems but it looks to have been sabotaged. Space pirates are in the area and the robot interceptors are working against us. Your orders are to fly your F-117 Starwarrior to Terra I, destroying anything that tries to harm you.</p>\n<p>You can move your ship up, down, left or right. You begin with a top-down view of the F-117, facing towards the bottom of the screen. Meteors and later space pirates come from the bottom moving up and you must shoot them. After you get through these, you switch to a side view of the ship and face left or right. Robot interceptors will come from the sides and must be destroyed then fish force fields (yes, fish force fields) will come from the top, moving down and you must shoot the fish-shaped devices to destroy them. They are Terra I's last defensive line so when you get through them, you win.</p>\n<p>In the two player games, player one controls the F-117's left and right movement and player two controls the up and down movement, therefore players must work together. Firing alternates between both players in two second intervals.</p>",

This has damaged the reactor, causing it to release radioactive particles. You must use the robot arm to retrieve these particles before the radiation builds too much and we have a meltdown.</p>\n<p>There are three sections per screen. They are colored, from top to bottom, red, blue and yellow. You start with one particle in each area and you must move the robot arm to intercept these particles, pushing the fire button to grasp them when they get to the robot arm.</p>\n<p>If you delay too long, however, the particles will split as they bounce around, causing the radiation level to build. If the radiation builds too much, you lose one robot arm. In later levels, you also must avoid hitting the circulating fans, as this will also destroy the robot arm. The game ends when you clear level nine and save the day or lose your last robot arm and the reactor enters meltdown.</p>",

Good luck.</p>\n<p>You move the joystick to aim at a gangster and push the button to fire. Your ammo is limited so don't fire randomly. Occasionally, Nitro Ed, on the roof, will hold up a grenade. You must shoot him to disarm him. You get money for each gangster shot. The values for level one are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mugsy=$20</li>\n<li>Scare Face=$30</li>\n<li>Lefty=$40</li>\n<li>Shifty=$50</li>\n<li>Disarming Nitro Ed=$100</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These amounts increase for each level by $10. You also get $10 for each bullet you have left after each level. There are six levels. The fourth level is a nighttime level. In this level, you must fire one bullet to light up the windows. If you do not fire for a couple seconds, they go dark again.  If you shoot an innocent, you will lose $1000 or your total amount if you have less than $1000.</p>\n<p>If a gangster rises all the way out of a window, after a couple of seconds, he will shoot you and you will lose one bullet proof vest (life). After you lose all your vests, the game is over and Nitro Ed will laugh at you. If Nitro Ed gets off his hand grenade, no matter how many vests you have, the game is over. And Nitro Ed will laugh at you. You start with four vests and can earn another at $5000.</p>",

To apply, insert cartridge into Atari 2600 and power on machine.</p>\n<p>You are shown what you are to build for 5 seconds. To get the bricks, go to either side of the screen and press in that direction. To lay a brick, press fire then down. When Spectradog comes on the screen, you must jump over him by pushing the joystick to the upper right or upper left or he will make you lose one life. As the building gets higher, the kid will steal the ladder. When the brat appears on the screen, you must get off the ladder or you will fall and lose one life. When the building gets to be several stories high, you must be leery of staying on the very top as lightning may strike and lose you a life. When you lose a life, you drop any bricks you were carrying.</p>\n<p>Once the building is complete, you go all the way up the ladder and push up to call the helicopter to take you to the next site. If the building is not correct, the helicopter will pick you up but then drop you near the edge of the screen, losing you a life. There are game selections for unlimited time but limited bricks and unlimited bricks but limited time.</p>",

In a two player game, each player controls a buggy and the computer controls the buggy boppers. In a four player game, two players control a buggy apiece and the other two control a buggy bopper apiece.</p>\n<p><strong>Tug of War</strong>: Simply pull the other team over the center line. In a two player game, each player control an entire team, each. In a four player game, each player controls one of the four players.</p>\n<p><strong>Wizard's Keep</strong>: Use the power of magic to destroy more targets for points than the opposing team. In a two player game, each player controls a pair of wizards. In a four player game, each player controls one wizard apiece. Note: Even though the screen in split, all wizards are shooting at the same targets so when a target is shot in one window, it will disappear in both.</p>\n<p><strong>Down on the Line</strong>: You must get a package from the left conveyor belt and pass it to the second worker who will then move it to the belt on the right that matches the package color. The game clock starts at 8:00 and the game ends when the clock reaches 5:00. In a two player game, each player controls a pair of workers. The package will pass from one worker to the other automatically. In a four player game, each player controls one worker apiece and must use the fire button to pass the package as well place it on the conveyor belt.</p>\n<p><strong>Handcar</strong>: A race to the finish line using railway handcars. In a two player game, each player controls one of the men on a handcar, the other works with him automatically. In a four player game, each player controls one of the men on both handcars.</p>",

        "description": "<p>For decades, the weapons satellites have orbited Earth harmlessly. Now, for unknown reasons, they have dropped from the sky to obliterate mankind. You are a test pilot with an experimental craft that can stop the satellites. It is up to you to protect your home town.</p>\n<p>You fly above your town's forcefield. Satellites will drop from the sky and show on the radar area at the screen top. You must fly to them and shoot them before they reach the town as they have the ability to penetrate the town's shields. Be aware of your fuel because if you run out of fuel, you lose a life. Also, be aware of the laser heat indicator just below the fuel gauge. If the laser gets too hot, it will not fire until it cools. The town's forcefield may not be able to stop the satellites, however, it will stop your craft so flying into it is detrimental to your health. In later levels, you must contend with meteors as well as satellites. You cannot shoot the meteors but they cannot penetrate the town's shields. You will be destroyed and lose a life, however, if you ram into one.</p>",

You must hop from the top to the river, landing on the turtle while avoiding snakes and choppers that will lose you a life and butterflies that will send you back to the start. Do not dally as you are timed and if time runs out, you lose a life. Once you get to the turtle, he will take you to The Land of Ledges. Here you must hop from ledge to ledge and change their color, ala <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Q*Bert\">Q*Bert</a>. Beware of the man at the top of the screen, as he will drop stones that will lose you a life. In later levels, he will change some ledges back to their original color, forcing you to retrace your steps. You are still timed so don't delay. After you finish The Land of Ledges, it is off to The Bunny Bushes. This is just a cinematic of you finding a mate and family. You can skip this if you press fire. Then the game starts back at the beginning only harder.</p>",

Now you must get to the island while collecting supplies , get through the dangerous jungle then explore the temple. All in a days work.</p>\n<p>This game is in three sections. They are called Shipwrecked, The Wilderness Island and The Secret Temple.</p>\n<p><strong>Shipwrecked</strong>: You begin on a raft in the water. You must make your way to the island at the top while avoiding sharks and other sea creatures. Along the way, you must collect food and water so you can survive the island. If a shark or other sea creature hits you, you will lose the raft and all supplies. If you are hit when not on a raft, you will lose your life. You can press fire to swim faster but this will cost you life points, which can get you killed.</p>\n<p><strong>The Wilderness Island</strong>: You make your way on the island while avoiding snakes, traps and other dangers. You must look for the temple, the key to the temple door and any other items you will need to get through the temple. Watch your food meter that it doesn't run out. Use the menu to eat food/drink water as needed. You can also switch to search mode, which allows you to place your walking stick on an item to learn what it is without getting hurt.</p>\n<p><strong>The Secret Temple</strong>: You make your way through the temple in first person perspective, trying to learn its secret. Sometimes you will need to find certain items to pass through magical barriers. Watch out for one-way walls and invisible transporters.</p>",

Then you must escape from the dungeons.</p>\n<p>The player begins in a maze. The narrow areas are corridors and the wider areas are rooms. The player must move from room to room, avoiding the wizard and his bat, gathering treasure, items and keys. Once in a room, standing around may prove to be fatal as each one of them has a dangerous monster. Some rooms have doors with either gold or a part of the sword behind them. When the player finds the sword piece, it will transport him to the next level of the dungeon.</p>\n<p>In the first two levels, the player will be able to see the entire maze. On the next two levels, the other parts of the mazes are revealed gradually, as they are explored. On all later levels, it's possible to see only what's directly around the player. The player loses life points whenever touched by a monster. In an encounter with the wizard, besides losing life points, an additional problem is to get through his skeletons. The player will start at the bottom of the screen and needs to make way to the top. In the final dungeon, all the rooms have only unlocked doors, however gold is need to bribe the monsters in order to search the doors for the exit.</p>\n<p>The items in the maze and their uses, are:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gold: Not a selectable item. Needed to bribe monsters in the last level</li>\n<li>Gems: After collecting nine gems, the player may use them to get one or more type of each other item.</li>\n<li>Lamp: Makes it possible to see the entire maze. Not needed for mazes one or two.</li>\n<li>Potion: Restores four to seven life points. The player can never have more than twenty-five total life points.</li>\n<li>Cross: Makes the wizard and the bat move as far from you as the can.</li>\n<li>Scroll: Allows the player to see the wizard and the bat, even if they are not in a visible portion of the maze. Not needed for mazes one and two.</li>\n<li>Ring: Makes the player invisible to the wizard, bat, and room monsters.</li>\n<li>Keys: Not a selectable item. Needed to open locked doors except on last dungeon. Keys do not leave the dungeon level where they are found. When the player gets the sword piece, any extra keys the player are carrying are lost and new ones must be found.</li>\n</ul>",

A Cosmic Kid starts at the bottom left of the screen and moves to the right then goes up one level moving left, all the while being chased by one or two Cosmic Creeps. You, using the space station, must fire and time your shots to hit a Creep, sending them back to the bottom. If your shot hits the Kid, a new Kid must start at the bottom and the planet's orbit decays a little more.</p>\n<p>If the planet's orbit decays completely or if a Cosmic Creep gets to the upper right of the screen, the game is over.

        "description": "<p>The year is 2037. Nations no longer fight monster wars, killing millions. Instead, two combatants enter an arena and fight for their countries' honor.</p>\n<p>This is a sequel to the 1977 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8851/combat/\">Combat</a> however, there are no planes, just tanks and missiles. Each player starts in a base in a corner, one in the upper left, the other in the lower right. You must seek out your opponent and shoot them three times to destroy their tank. If they are under trees or, in another game variation, behind walls, you must shoot the trees/walls out of the way first to reach them. Each player has three tanks. The winner is the last one standing.</p>\n<p>If you are still in your base, you can press the button to fire a homing missile that will seek out your opponent. When the homing missile hits, it counts as two shots. Missiles must reload between shots and the reloading time is several seconds. If a tank is not hit for several seconds, the 'crew' will affect repairs.</p>\n<p>There are game variations for trees, which you can drive but not shoot through, walls, which you can neither drive nor shoot through and versions where you can place the trees/walls where you would like them to be.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Wham! Bam! Watch out, ma'am!</p>\n<p>You are Demolition Herby and you're out to own the roads. You must drive around a square section to black it out; the object being to black out all sections. There are only three things in your way: the chase cars. When they drive over a line you have turned red, it turns white again. To make matters worse, they will try to ram you off the track. The good news is if you ram them from behind, you run them off the track for a few seconds. If you need a burst of speed, shift into overdrive by pressing your button however, there is a drawback, as I will explain. Something else to keep an eye on is your fuel. You burn fuel as your drive and burn faster when you use overdrive. Each time you black out an section, you gain points and fuel. If you black out two sections at once, you gain more fuel. You will lose a life if you run out of fuel or are knocked off the track. If you lose three lives, the game is over.</p>",

Kong is throwing bombs at you.</p>\n<p>This game is a clone of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Donkey+Kong\">Donkey Kong</a>, except instead of barrels, you must avoid bombs. You must make your way across the floors and up the ladders while jumping over bombs for points and holes in the floor. There is also a timer in the upper right. It starts at nine-hundred ninety and counts down ten points per second. If you are hit by a bomb or fall through a hole in the floor or the time reaches zero, you lose a life. Occasionally, Kong will release a magic bomb that gives more points when you jump it as well as moves you to the next floor up. Once you reach the top floor, the game starts again but faster.</p>",

The player controls a ship shown from a side view that can freely move around the fixed screen and can face both directions. Enemies called \"space oysters\" appear from the right and need to be shot to convert them into pearls that need to be collected before they leave the screen on the left side. Collecting is done by colliding with them, which transports them to a \"pearl zone\" on the left side of the screen marked by two vertical columns. The pearls are stored there, but can still be stolen by enemies when they pass.</p>\n<p>The game tracks the score and a meter is filled at the bottom of the screen showing progress. There are four lives and a new one is provided for every 4,000 points. For every row of eight pearls a bomb is provided. At the end of a level an Oystron boss appears. It can only be defeated by putting a bomb in its path so it cannot get away. As soon as the boss appears a warp phase is entered and the player's ship travels at a fast speed, avoiding enemy collisions. There are three difficulty levels.</p>",

You must sink ships with your torpedoes.</p>\n<p>You move your sub left or right with the joystick and launch a torpedo with the button. Try to shoot past the mines as they waste torpedoes and give no points. Try to hit ships, destroyers, enemy subs and PT boats. Try to avoid hitting the white ships as these will cause your torpedoes to rebound back down. You have fifty torpedoes and ninety-nine fuel. You lose a life when you run out of fuel. After three lives, the game is over.</p>",

Years of constant assault\nfrom the EXIDY coalition have left Earth almost totally defenseless.</p>\n<p>Intergalactic intelligence has discovered a new threat, several Exidy\nfreighters, protected by an armada of smaller vessels, have entered a\nfriendly sector of space and are advancing on Earth itself, loaded with\nenough weaponry to completely annihilate the planet.*</p>\n<p>You are Earth's only hope.</p>\n<p>Aim your cross hair onto an enemy ship and press the button to fire. Try to shoot as many enemies as you can. Once you destroy all the enemies in a sector, a warp gate appears. Shoot it to warp to the next sector. Whenever your ship gets a direct hit from enemy fire, your shield loses energy. To restore shield energy look out for, and shoot, energy diamonds.</p>",

When a mole pops out of his hole, press the corresponding button on the Kid's Controller to whack it. The faster you hit him, the more points you'll get. If the King Mole pops up, whack him for even higher points. Beware of the acorn. If it pops up, don't whack it as it will cost you points. You must score at least three hundred points by the time the mole count reaches zero. If you reach or exceed three hundred points in one round, any points beyond three hundred will be added to your score as a bonus. If you fail to score three hundred points in one round, the game is over.</p>",

If you are captured, you must press your button to escape then head south to the desert. After the desert, you enter the poison caves. There are no apes here but you will lose a life point every second you are within. These caves are a maze you must get through but be advised that not all exits lead to the human stronghold.

Unfortunately, even in a galaxy far far away not everything is as peaceful as it first seems, for Hotot has discovered an alien missile base hidden on his planet. Manned by strange blue aliens, these evil intruders are using your planet as a launching site for their deadly warhead which is posed to destroy the galaxy's power source. With the help of the birdlike Gorfons, you must destroy the warhead, and prevent the destruction of the galaxy! Good luck Hotot. You are the Saboteur.</em></p>\n<p>On the first screen, you are trying to prevent the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves from completing a missile. You will be helped by the Gorfrons. While the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves will build up the missile, the Gorfrons will steal pieces to lower it. Beware of the Master robot on the top catwalk as it will try to shoot you and the Gorfrons to prevent your interference. After you finish the Rocket Construction Site, it is off to Warhead Assembly.</p>\n<p>In Warhead Assembly, you must destroy the warhead parts on the conveyor belt. There is just one little problem; the conveyor belt is protected by a field. The good news is that the Master robot's energy is on the same frequency so what you do is shoot the Master robot and the shot will then head for the conveyor belt. Of course, the Master robot isn't just standing there, letting you bounce shots off him. He has released a security drone that bounces around the screen trying to hit you. Also, the Master robot will hurt you if you touch him. If you destroy the parts before time runs out, you will advance to a harder round. If not, you must destroy the warhead one-on-one.</p>\n<p>In the Warhead Showdown, you must destroy the warhead with a shot. Of course, the warhead isn't gonna stand for that as it has an impressive defense matrix that will try to hold you off. If you take too long to destroy the warhead, it will escape into space.

The ship will start throwing down nets or harpoons, depending on the settings, to kill the whales. You must aim at the nets, in any direction and shoot them. After several nets/harpoons have been sent, radioactive debris will flow from the right side on the screen. This is up too high to hurt the whales but it can hurt you. You must shoot it as well.

        "description": "<p><em>The year is 2947. Earth is being invaded by the evil K\u2019caj clan from the Yenrut galaxy. You are Galactic Commander Frank Drexor. The United States Space Guard has commissioned you with the task of defending the most important sector of the galaxy from the invaders. K\u2019caj technology is much more advanced than the technology of Earth. Some of the ships have tractor beams. Others are equipped with subspace energy disruptors. These disruptors create energy barriers that will actually cause the shots from your cannons to reflect back at you! If your mission is a failure, the K\u2019caj will gain control of this vital sector of space, allowing them to maneuver their troops and equipment much more efficiently and gain a larger foothold in the battle for the planet. This would certainly spell disaster for the citizens of Earth. Their fate is in your hands!</em> </p>\n<p>You have a gun on the top of the screen and one on the bottom, each of which travel left or right. To switch between weapons, just press the joystick up or down. You must be careful when you fire because if you shoot your own gun, you will lose a life. There is a yellow spaceship that starts on the row next to the middle row and moves across the screen. Each time it reaches the screen, it moves one row closer to one side. If it gets to your gun, you lose as life. Later in the game, barriers appear in the playing field. You must be careful when these are there as they will reflect your gun's shots back, losing you a life if they hit. In the center, at times, there is a UFO colored either red, blue or green. The red is worth one-hundred points, the blue grants and extra life and the green resets the difficulty to level one without removing the points. Play simply continues until you lose all your lives.</p>",

They look like the ridiculous aliens depicted in 1980\u2019s arcade games, but are extremely dangerous and their goal is to exterminate all humans! You command a fleet of spaceships and you must defeat all of the Invaders to save Earth! Good luck!</em></p>\n<p>This game is inspired by the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a> but with a twist. Yes, there are rows of invaders moving across the screen then moving down, firing as they go. Yes, your ship moves left and right at the bottom of the screen, firing up. Yes, an enemy ship will travel across the top of the screen. But there, the similarities end. For one thing, there are no shields to hide behind. Your ship does have a shield you activate by pulling back on the joystick but be warned, it drains all your energy so when you use it, after it is gone, you cannot move or fire for a second.</p>\n<p>Also, the aliens are not dropping just electric shots. They also drop any of sixteen Special Shots. Some of these will help you, most will hinder you.</p>\n<p>The Special Shots do the following:* Your ship's movements and shots become faster. Duration: ten seconds</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your ship's left/right movements are inverted. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.</li>\n<li>Your ship's movements and shots become slower. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.</li>\n<li>Enemies do not fire. Duration: ten seconds</li>\n<li>Inavders' electric shots descend at maximum speed. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.</li>\n<li>Invaders' electric shots track your ship. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.</li>\n<li>Invaders stop moving. Duration: five seconds</li>\n<li>Invaders move very fast. Duration: one second</li>\n<li>All shots, your and the invaders, become invisible. Duration: ten seconds</li>\n<li>If you shoot at an invader or the enemy ship and miss, a randomly generated invader could appear. And your \u201cShoot Abort\u201d option, wherein when you shoot again the last shot disappears, is temporary disabled. Duration: thirty seconds</li>\n<li>Your ship freezes. Duration: one second</li>\n<li>Invaders\u2019 electric shots follow a random path. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.</li>\n<li>Your shots follow a random path. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.</li>\n<li>Your shots don\u2019t stop when they hit an enemy but continue straight to the top of the screen, killing any enemies it hits. Duration: five seconds</li>\n<li>A randomly chosen invader blinks. If you don\u2019t blast it immediately, every few moments a new invader is randomly generated. Duration: thirty seconds</li>\n<li>A randomly chosen invader blinks. If you don\u2019t blast it before the bonus expires, your ship will explode. Duration: ten seconds. Meaning you have ten seconds to shoot that invader or lose a life</li>\n</ul>",

You must move to the track with the correct color bit and press the button when it is at you to clear it then it is on to the next track. If the needed bit gets past you off the right side of the screen, it will enter the buffer on the bottom left of the screen. If the buffer overflows, the hard drive will crash and game over. You score is displayed in hexadecimal. The first two numbers are the level followed by your score.</p>",

You must place the gems on the growing pile so that there are three or more of the same color in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally. When you get three or more of the same color in a row, they will disappear from the screen. If you get a combo of three or more levels, you get a high bonus. A combo is when gems disappear and cause more gems to line up and disappear. Occasionally, three gems that change colors and have colored horizontal bars across them will appear. These will create a row with whatever gems you place them on. At the end of the level, a flashing white gem with a horizontal white bar will drop down. This will remove whatever color gem it is placed on, regardless of where they are on the screen. If the gems pile up to the line at the top of the screen, the game is over.</p>",

You begin with your lander in the mothership at the top of the screen. You exit by pressing the button. You must guide your lander around asteroids to land on one of three platforms at the bottom. Be sure to press the button so you fire the retrorockets so you do not come in at too high a speed and destroy the lander. Also, take care not to hit the survivor you are going to try to rescue. Once you have your survivor, some of the asteroids change into flying saucers. You must then fly back up through these obstacles to dock with the mothership's docking area. Do not hit the left or right of it or you lose a life and the survivor you were carrying. Once all survivors are rescued, it is off to level two.</p>",

Your character runs towards the horizon, from which a pyramid arises as you go, while spears shoot from left or right. You must jump or duck the spears by pushing up or down on the joystick.</p>\n<p>After you clear the Gauntlet, you must run up the Stairs of the pyramid while the priests throw stones down at you. You must push left or right to avoid these stones hitting you.</p>\n<p>Using the left difficulty switch, you can select to play one level after another of the Gauntlet or play level one of Gauntlet followed by level one of Stairs then level two and so on. The right difficulty switch selects music or sounds.</p>",

You are Jane Marvin. Your finance and five of your friends are turning into alligators due to a failed medical experiment. You must get the alligator antidote to cure them.</p>\n<p>You, as a syringe, must move about the screen, gathering antidotes and serums. Serums supposedly increase the strength of the antidote so you need less to cure someone. You must then aim at the infected person at the top or bottom of the screen and press your button to inject them. The longer you take to get the antidote to them, the more they will mutate and the more antidote it will require to cure them. Everything is not so simple, however, as there are normal alligators in the swamp and you will lose you a life if they touch you. You can shoot to kill them and it will not cost you an antidote.</p>\n<p>Some variations have walls that move. These make it harder to see the alligators, antidotes and serums. Serums only appear in variations with walls. Some variations allow you to pass through the walls, others will make the walls solid and they can crush you if you get between two closing ones. Once you cure all six friends, it is off to the next level.</p>",

This year the cartridge, dubbed <em>Stella's Stocking</em>, contains five games.</p>\n<p><strong>Stay Frosty</strong>:  </p>\n<p>You are a snowman at the North Pole. One of the Christmas lights on Santa's barn, where he stores the reindeer dust that makes reindeer fly, has shorted and started a fire. You have to put out the fires but be careful because if your temperature goes up, you'll start to melt and get all wishy-washy.</p>\n<p><strong>Elf Dash</strong>:  </p>\n<p>You are Holly the Elf. Santa is on his way, the warehouse is locked up and the year-end blowout starts in ten minutes. Suddenly, Ben the Elf bursts in and says Mrs. Claus demands that the decorations be changed for the party. He hands you a list. Great! These things are scattered about the warehouse. You need to guide Holly about to gather the needed things in time or its stable cleaning for Holly.</p>\n<p><strong>Cold War</strong>:  </p>\n<p>This, quite simply, is a snowball fight between snowmen. Grab you snowball, take aim and knock his block off.</p>\n<p><strong>Grandma's Revenge</strong>:  </p>\n<p>Grandma got run over by a reindeer so now that she's recovered, she's out for revenge. Guide Grandma about the screen in her car to run over the reindeer.</p>\n<p><strong>Tossing Cookies</strong>:  </p>\n<p>It's Christmas Eve and the reindeer have flown off. As if that wasn't bad enough, it is a stormy night. You, as Santa, must guide your sleigh about, gathering the magical cookies that make the reindeer fly, while avoiding lightning. You then use these cookies to lure the reindeer back to the North Pole.</p>",

The Jarvians will send wave after wave to try to break through the colony's defense shield and/or destroy the defense cannons. The defense laser fires non-stop so you just need to use the joystick to place the cross hair over an enemy to kill them. If the enemies get to be too much, press fire to activate the Mega Blaster and destroy all the enemies on the screen.. Be advised that you only have three shots for the Mega Blaster. If the colony or cannons are destroyed, the game is over.</p>\n<p>The Jarvian ships are:* The Fighter: This is the most common and several attack at once, firing at the shield and colony and, sometimes, your cannon.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Advisor: This will cause the Fighters to target faster so remove it as soon as you can.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Bomber: This one will not target the shield but will try to bomb your cannon.

The wolf will always attack the decoys before resuming his hunt for the actual treasure hunter.</p>\n<p>Can the treasure hunter collect the treasure or will the wolf huff and puff and snuff out his candle?</p>",

The player has to navigate a maze of walls in a limited amount of time while also avoiding oncoming jellyfish.</p>\n<p>Once the player reaches the top of the board, a new and more difficult round starts. Scoring is achieved by staying on top of the wave as long as possible. Extra lives are awarded for every 1000 points.</p>",

It offers relative protection with the building walls. The second phase has the enemy tanks crossing two bridges over a river, but there's practically no cover.

Enemy bullets can be canceled by hitting them with one's own bullet. The player loses one life if they collide with one of the tanks or the enemy bullets.

The player controls an \"adventurer\" (called Kong in some versions of the game) and has to reach the treasures the evil octopus hid away.</p>\n<p>Each level consists of a series of platforms that are interconnected by ladders. The only action the player can take besides moving around is pressing fire to make the hero jump. This is necessary to get across the gaps between some of the platforms. At the same time, the player has to avoid the smaller octopi as well as clouds of poison gas which move around the screen randomly. Once the player reaches one of the treasure chests at the top of the screen they won the level and a new round starts. <em>Pac-Kong</em> can also be played by two players in an alternating fashion.</p>\n<p>There are various versions of the game which have different sprites for the antagonist, its weapons and the protagonist but are otherwise identical.</p>",

On each turn the player places a disc on the board by selecting a location where the opponents discs will become trapped between two of his discs. The trapped discs are flipped over to the players color. The game ends when the board is filled or time runs out, and the player with the greatest number of his color discs on the board wins. Two players can play against each other, or one player against the computer.</p>",

When it reaches the top, it restarts at the bottom. The object is to press your button when the rising line on the left is within the small line on the left. This will cause a new line to rise. If you press the button when the rising line is not in the left small line or let the rising line reach the top, the new line will lower. To clear the level, get the new line all the way to the top.

Well, no matter, one way or another you'll get your tree!</p>\n<p>You must make your way two screens to the right to get to your tree. Animals will come at you from either side of the screen. You must either jump over the animal or press your button and push the joystick in the desired direction to chop them with your axe. Snakes cannot be chopped, only jumped over. </p>\n<p>Also to contend with is a bird in the air that is dropping stones. If you are hit by a stone, you will be unable to move for two seconds, which could prove fatal. Once you reach the tree, you must chop it down while still avoiding the animals. It takes four chops per side to fell the tree. If you need to, you can climb the tree to avoid animals. Once the tree is chopped, the game restarts at a faster level. You have only one life so if an animal touches you, it is game over.</p>",

You are in charge of the command posts at the edges of the city and need to defend it from the invaders. The various Gorgon craft will keep flying by on the screen in varying numbers and in different flight patterns. At first they fly high in the sky but then progressively lower. If an enemy makes it low enough before you destroy it, it will use it's weapons and destroy one of the buildings in Atlantis. As you progress in the game, the enemy craft will keep increasing in speed. The game ends when all remaining buildings in the city have been destroyed.</p>\n<p>Sounds familiar? It should. <em>Atlantis II</em> is an altered version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10248/atlantis/\">Atlantis</a> When <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/56/imagic/\">Imagic</a> ran the Defend Atlantis contest, they wanted to find the top four highest-scoring players and invite them to Bermuda for a grand finale shoot-out for cash prizes. The top two-hundred fifty contestants would get snorkeling sets and the top one-thousand contestants would get t-shirts. Unfortunately, more than four people maxed out the score on <em>Atlantis</em> so, to break this tie, all of these maxed-out scorers were sent snorkeling sets and t-shirts as well as a modified <em>Atlantis</em> game called <em>Atlantis II</em>. The modified game is faster, scores lower per hit and the score font is different.</p>",

Instead, you have a screen with nine horizontal levels. There are dots, candies, if you will, on each level. You must eat all the candies to get a teeth brushing and advance to the next, harder, level. Also on the levels are happy faces. They are happy to knock your teeth out, which they will do if you touch them. This will lose you a life. When all lives are lost, the game is over.</p>\n<p>Three times per level, a vitamin pill will appear in the center of the screen. If you eat this, the faces will turn red, allowing you to eat them for a short time. The faces will flash red and white, briefly, before returning to normal, as a warning. To move from level to level, there are moving openings on the levels or you can move to the far left or far right of the screen.</p>",

After a time, the plate begins to wobble. When this happens, move under the plate and press your button, repeatedly, to get the plate up to speed again. If a plate falls, if you can get to it before it hits the ground, it will be placed back on the stick. Your score is based on how long you keep plates spinning. After four plates fall and crash, the game is over.</p>",

Help Teddy climb the mountain to reach his mommy.</p>\n<p>In <em>I Want My Mommy</em>, the player must guide little Teddy up two mountains. The first has an apple on top and the second has his mommy waiting to give him a hug. To progress up the mountain the player must stand on a raised block and press the button to raise a magical stardust ladder which can be climbed to reach a higher level. If needed, the player can also climb down. To reach the top level, the player must have all ladders raised or they will be blocked.</p>\n<p>On levels two through five, there is a dream demon waiting to knock Teddy down the mountain. Teddy cannot jump, however; all the player can do is avoid the dream demons or catch mommy's special kiss as it floats along. This will allow the player to knock out one demon. The kiss eventually wears off, however. If the player is knocked off the mountain, they start back at the bottom of the first screen, with the apple at the top.</p>\n<p>The score counter starts at zero and counts up. The faster the player gets Teddy to mommy, the lower your score. The goal is to have as low a score as possible.</p>",

Players can shoot bits of seaweed as they appear or let them build up for more points. The more bits of seaweed shot with one torpedo, the more each bit of seaweed is worth. Players have to decide whether they want to keep their sector clear or if they want to risk everything for more points.</p>\n<p>Players must also avoid creatures called Wrothopods that swim down to feed and mature seaweed tentacles that reach up from the depths. A homing health canister is dropped each time players shoot 100 bits of seaweed. Corroded homing health canisters can sometimes be found trapped within the bits of seaweed. When a corroded homing health canister is released, players have a couple of seconds to recover it before its sensors activate and it tries to ram them.</p>\n<p>The game has a pause feature and a setting for left-handed players who like to rotate the joystick clockwise (putting the fire button in the top right corner).</p>",

Once in Las Vegas, they turn around and head back to Tucson.  Along the way, they encounter the same cactus over and over again while the sun sets and a moon rises.</p>\n<p>The bus cannot go faster than 42 miles per hour and will occasionally drive into the sand and stall unless the driver constantly adjusts the steering. An odometer shows the distance traveled and a helpful road sign indicates arrival at your destination. Upon completing the journey to Las Vegas and back, the player is presented with the final score.</p>\n<p>A joystick controller is used to move the bus forward and to steer from left to right. The action button honks the horn, which has no effect on gameplay.</p>",

Unfortunately, there are asteroids and aliens which threaten the player's life...</p>\n<p><em>Missile War</em> is a shooter and the only goal is surviving long enough in order to achieve a high-score. The player can move the space ship freely horizontally and vertically and shoot at the straight moving obstacles which enter the screen from the right side. Points are earned when obstacles are shot down and lost when they exit the left side of the screen. There are three obstacle types: asteroids, asteroids which divide into two smaller asteroids when shot and fast space ships. It is important to shoot down the enemy ships: if they are able to exit the screen, the player loses a life instead of just points. Because there are no enemy projectiles, the only other way to die is touching an obstacle. The background is plain-coloured.</p>",

The first stage has the stuntman climbing ropes in order to get to a helicopter while also dodging flying birds. The second stage has the stuntman climbing ropes again but now arms him with a sword and requires him to defeat the flying devilfaces before he can make his escape. The third stage has the stuntman climbing ropes again dodging enemies, but he must also grab a hold of all of the balloons on the stage before he make his getaway. The stages then repeat in this order two more times with the later stages increasing the challenge by adding more enemies. After completing the nine stages, the game repeats at the next highest speed level. There are six speed levels in total and the desired speed level may be chosen from the beginning also.</p>",

Bobby has to jump over various obstacles laying in his path such as rocks, ponds, fountains, and broken bridges and also has to be careful not to collide with several animals that can get in his way such as hawks, chickens, butterflies, and bats. The game consists of seven screens of these obstacles with the eighth screen being obstacle free as it just involves simply walking Bobby forward into his house. Bobby starts with five lives on his journey home. He also starts with 3,000 points and will gain a 1,000 more for each screen he clears or for each time he loses a life. The score will constantly decrease so its ideal for the player to reach Bobby's house as fast as possible so they can rack up a high score.</p>",

Now mankind is stuck in the stone age and it just so happens they start getting attacked by Amazon condors. Also of concern are other enemies of mankind that traveled back in time with them, the Nirobean Spiders and the vulcanian bats. Being the only one who has a futuristic weapon (a galactic disintegrator)  that survived this timewarp, it's up to the player to repel these menacing creatures and hope the few surviving scientists are able to find a way back into the future.</p>\n<p>Players control the galactic disintegrator mounted on the Earth's slidable firebase. The firebase's size depends on the difficulty setting selected, with the larger size being the harder difficulty as it's easier for the opponents to hit it. Players fire the disintegrator and earn points for each enemy they destroy. The smaller enemies always earn three points for each one destroyed while the larger enemies' points will increase for each wave the player shoots through. There are nine different waves with the last wave earning the player 99 points for each large enemy destroyed.</p>\n<p>The player starts with six firebases and can earn extra bases for each 1,000 points scored,</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Assembloids 2600</em> is a fast paced reaction puzzler based on the 2010 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Quartet\">Quartet</a>. The playfield consists of 5 windows, arranged in a plus shape. Parts of creatures in different colours appear in the central one, and then have to be moved to one of the four other windows using the joystick. If a window already has the space of that part occupied the player will lose a life. A life is also lost if the player takes too long to move the part. When a full creature is assembled the player is awarded points. The more uniformly coloured the creature is the higher the point gain. If the player manages to clear all the windows and extra life is awarded.</p>\n<p>The game gets faster as it goes on, losing a life will slow it down a bit, but upon doing well again it goes back to getting faster pretty quick. There are a number of difficulty settings available, which have an impact on how fast the game gets and how quickly the speed picks up.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The End of the World</em> is a single-screen shooter. A big alien station, which occupies the top part of the screen, attacks a planet. The player controls a laser base which tries to repel the attacks.</p>\n<p>Said laser base is bound to the bottom of the screen and can be moved horizontally as well as shoot lasers (one at the time) towards the enemy. The alien station itself is outside the laser's reach, and so are the two robots it releases during each round. Those move around the screen and shoot three kinds of projectiles downwards: destroyer probes (should be shot for 100 points), spiders (must be shot because if one reaches the ground, one of the five lives is lost) and laser rays (must be avoided because they are deadly by touch). After 5000 points are reached, a new round with higher difficulty starts: the robots are faster and the playing field is reduced left and right.</p>\n<p>The goal is to reach the highest score possible before the inevitable defeat. The two-player mode is alternating and features no player interaction besides comparing the scores.</p>",

The player controls a plane bomber near the top of the screen and needs to destroy buildings below by dropping bombs on them. Each successful hit is rewarded with points. Successive hits are rewarded through combos.</p>\n<p>The plane only moves in one direction, but the player can determine the speed by moving left or right. When the plane disappear on one side of the screen it wraps around and appears on the other side, but slightly slower, so the pressure increases to flatten the buildings before the plane hits one of them.</p>\n<p>The player needs to watch out for birds that suddenly appear and steam launched upwards from pipes. There are also trees that can optionally be bombed and hospitals that need to be avoided. The game is available in NTSC, PAL and SECAM as separate versions.</p>",

Players could order the game as a gift for another person; the developer would customize the title screen with the recipient's name and manufacture a custom copy for them.
