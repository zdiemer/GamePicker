        "description": "<p>Legend says that there exists an ancient world known as Vereator, powered by the mysterious energy Verbias. The treasure hunter Connor Macguire and his assistant Rania venture into deep space in search of riches. Their ship is trapped in Vereator, and the two begin to explore the strange world, hoping to find the source of Verbias. On the way they will have to defeat robotic legions of a malevolent professor who pursues his own agenda.</p>\n<p><em>Die Bahnwelt</em> is a top-down shooter. The player navigates Connor through maze-like environments, shooting at frequently respawning enemies in eight directions. A second character participates in battles on his side, controlled by computer AI; general tactics can be assigned to that character by the player through conversation. Each of the two characters can hold up to four weapons, using various types of energy ammo that can be found in treasure chests or dropped by enemies. Weapons can be switched at any time. There are no healing items, but both characters continuously regenerate their health. It is possible to save the game at any time.</p>",

Shortly thereafter, satellites reported that beacon transmissions from the ship have stopped. Seeing that further investigation required exploration of hostile environment and deep sea, the authorities dispatched a special team known as W-ODL to find out what has happened to the ship. Navigating a powerful mecha, the American pilot Fredric von Nyuya has to get to the bottom of the mystery and report his findings to the crew.</p>\n<p><em>Aquales</em> is an action platformer. The mecha is equipped with a default fist-like melee weapon and gains access to other methods of destruction later, including chainguns, rockets, homing missiles, and more exotic items such as a gravity flamethrower. The stages usually consist of series of platforms and are fairly large, with optional areas and power-ups (health, one-time attacks, etc.) in treasure chests. The protagonist's stand-out equipment is the grappling hook, which must be used frequently to access high platforms. The game also has a light RPG angle: the hero gains experience points from defeating enemies and levels up as a result. Each stage ends with a boss battle, after which the player's progress is saved.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Prostitute Maker</em> is a life simulation game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/11646/princess-maker/\">Princess Maker</a>: a heroic father, who has defeated the forces of Lucifer himself and restored City 13 to its former glory of frivolous pleasures, is entrusted with the task of bringing up his daughter. The distinction between the premises of the two games, however, is significant: the father sees it as his parental duty to turn his child into a prostitute.</p>\n<p>The game starts when the daughter is already a teenager. Just as in <em>Princess Maker</em>, the player has to make schedules for the girl, comprised out of various activities. These include part-time jobs of various (not necessarily lewd) kinds, studying, resting, taking a trip, etc. Such activities increase the girl's parameters, making her more attractive. It is also possible to buy items and clothes and outfit the girl with them. Once the player feels that his protegee is ready, a meeting with a client can be arranged. Unlike <em>Princess Maker</em>, there is no exploration, battles, or other RPG elements in the game.</p>",

Only one person can stop the insanity - the attractive secret agent with the codename Lyew\u00e4rd.</p>\n<p><em>Guerri\u00e8re Lyew\u00e4rd</em> is a side-scrolling beat-em-up. The gameplay is very simple: the player moves the protagonist through strictly linear stages from left to right, each containing a few types of female enemies that attack the heroine from both sides. The secret agent can punch, kick, and jump. Power-ups such as health-restoring hearts and invincibility appear at set points during the stages, floating in the air. Each stage culminates with a boss battle against a powerful female enemy; defeating the boss leads to a lesbian sex scene.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Knight Arms: The Hyblid Framer</em> (<em>sic</em>) is a shoot-em-up in which the player controls a flying mecha who has to venture into deep space to sabotage alien installations and eventually save the Earth. The game's stand-out feature are its two gameplay modes. When in space, the protagonist is controlled from an over-the-shoulder third-person view in a 3D environment. Forward movement is automated, but changing altitude to engage aerial enemies in combat or blast stationary machines is essential. Once in an indoor environment, the player character is navigated in a more common side-scrolling fashion, though altitude continues to play an important role. Power-ups include health-restoring items (repair kits), additional weaponry, etc.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In 21th century the Earth became overpopulated, and humans began building colonies in the solar system. Technological expansion led to widespread pollution; in order to counter it, a powerful computer Naious was built. One century later, humans became completely dependent on Naious, and that was when it stroke unexpectedly. European cities were reduced to ruins after a single attack. The fighter spacecraft ASP and its pilot Manami Katagiri were dealing with a possible rebellion on Jupiter when it became clear that the future fate of humanity depends on them.</p>\n<p><em>Naious</em> is a horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up. The gameplay is fairly traditional and involves navigating outdoor and indoor stages (often with narrow spaces), destroying mobile and stationary enemies on the way. The fighter craft starts with a vulcan gun and can later change to wide shot, laser, and homing missiles. Rather infrequent power-ups appear at set points on the stages and change or enhance the plane's weapons.</p>",

The main difference lies in presentation, with higher-quality music and significantly more detailed graphics. The gameplay is mostly unchanged, with the exception of the possibility to equip four options on the player-controlled ship (as opposed to only two in the original version) and a few tweaks to secondary weapons and power-ups. Two new stages and four boss enemies have been added to this version.</p>",

She is nicknamed \"famous detective\" because of her unusually sharp perception: since her childhood, she has possessed an inexplicable \"sixth sense\" that warns her of danger by coloring her vision red. When her former classmate and successful model Marie is brutally murdered, Miyu decides to use her special senses and investigate the mysterious circumstances of her death.</p>\n<p>The sixth installment in System Sacom's <em>Novel Ware</em> series, <em>Yami no Ketsuzoku</em> is a Japanese-style adventure game. The player interacts with the environment by selecting objects to look at, conversation topics, and locations to travel to from a menu. There are no puzzles or inventory items to use. The game features extended text descriptions, cutscenes, and dialogues which sometimes prompt the player to make choices for the heroine.</p>",

It can be considered a shooter, since all the controllable characters can only fight with projectile attacks: Rilule shoots stars that damage enemies in a straight line, her first companion has an area wind attack, etc. As the player completes stages more magicians join the party. Up to three characters can be taken to explore hostile areas; however, the player can only select one character at a time, switching between them at will. </p>\n<p>Every character also possesses a unique powerful magic attack, which depletes MP and is activated by pressing down the action key and charging power. Health- and magic-restoring items can be found in chests or dropped by enemies. Stage progression is for the most part linear; each stage ends with a boss battle.</p>",

The kingdom of Edel is ravaged by his underlings. Princess Tia Lohengrin manages to escape and meets Stil, the grandson of the warrior who first defeated Valusa. Stil must now fight his way through the monster-infested land and take the fight back to Valusa.</p>\n<p><em>Valusa no Fukush\u016b</em> is a side-scrolling action game. Most of the game consists of traversing linear stages, fighting rapidly spawning regular enemies and bosses. Stil's default weapon is a sword; during the course of the game, he will acquire other weapons, such as throwing knives and shurikens. Enemies drop health-restoring items as well as temporary power-ups, e.g. a lightning attack that stays on the screen for a short while. When Stil's health bar is depleted, the player is taken back to the beginning of the stage with unlimited continues.</p>",

Story-wise, it is identical to the original version. However, there are more characters in the towns, and some of them have additional dialogue lines.</p>\n<p>Location layout roughly follows that of the original, particularly in dungeon design. Outdoor areas, however, are somewhat smaller. On the contrary, the first town has been expanded with more buildings and places of interest.</p>\n<p>Basic gameplay and items remain intact, and there are no substantial additions. However, many enemies are different and attack more aggressively in groups. Character growth system has been re-balanced, with Adol gaining more EXP and health when leveling up. There are other changes as well - for example, the first boss attacks right at the entrance of the dungeon instead of being in a room inside.</p>\n<p>The game has been completely re-done with technically more advanced graphics. The visual style departs from the traditional Japanese anime aesthetics, and instead opts for a more realistic style, which is particularly evident in character portraits.</p>",

The player is presented with a screen covered by face-down cards, and has to click on them one at a time, matching two identically-looking ones to make them disappear. Each wrong move removes a life from the player character. Cards that can be matched are portraits of young women; other cards include Life Up (grants an additional life), Death (instant loss of life), and Shuffle (re-arranges all the cards). The player must complete a set amount of correct match-ups in a round before running out of lives. Doing that leads to a picture of a young girl who gradually undresses as the player wins more rounds. It is possible to play against four girls to view different pictures, but the gameplay and the cards are identical for all of them.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Neural Gear</em> is a pseudo-3D scrolling shooter similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1434/space-harrier/\">Space Harrier</a>. You play as Emi T. Fonon, a futuristic soldier from the years after World War IV, who wears a bio-powered suit that can fly back in time and destroy time travelling robots. Each level goes back to an earlier date and has more numerous and powerful enemies.</p>\n<p>The game is completely controlled with the mouse. Left clicking fires the main weapon - yellow energy balls, while right clicking fires a sub weapon, which is chosen at the start of the level. There are four sub weapons to choose from: SPC that shoots powerful blue energy balls, Rockets, Homing Missiles and the most powerful sub weapon in the game \"???\" which is actually a bomb that can instantly kill all enemies on screen, including bosses but it also take out around 500-600 health.</p>\n<p>An interesting feature of this game is the health system. The timer at the top of the screen also acts as the health bar and it decreases faster when you get hit. Enemies come in large groups, sometimes in formations, and shooting twenty enemies will refill your timer 200 points. Getting to the end of a level also adds a certain amount to the timer depending on the level.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Buster is a Japanese doujin platform game that's clearly been heavily influenced by Arcade platformers of the late 1980s, like Wardner and Legend of Hero Tonma. In it, the player travels, in the traditional manner, from left to right, killing enemies as you go. One standout feature is the sword meter, which decreases every time you make a normal attack, and replenishes gradually when you're not attacking. You do also have an alternate attack, in the form of a sliding kick, performed by pressing the attack button at the same time as hitting the ground after a jump or fall. The sliding kick doesn't deplete the sword meter, and in fact quickly replenishes a large portion of it.</p>\n<p>The stages are designed with precision, and they expect to be played with precision in return. The first stage allows the player to get acquainted with the controls and mechanics, but as soon as the first boss is defeated, the game no longer has any mercy. There are jumps which require pixel-perfect accuracy, and a little later, situations that require that accuracy in jumping, but also perfect timing in attacking, and all in tiny time frames with no space for error.</p>\n<p>The maker, E. Hashimoto, later went on to make a few fairly well-known PC games, such as Akuji the Demon, and Guardian of Paradise. He's also made a pseudo-remake of Buster, 11 years after the original was released.</p>",

The mission is to destroy enemy space stations in each stage within a strict time limit. A map points out where each station is and more points are awarded for taking out the ones that say \"TARGET\" in order, than just destroying them randomly. You can power up your ordinary shot into a more powerful spread shot. Also your ship has a plasma bar; it is charged by holding the shot button, when full it will protect you from one shot and when released creates a wave of energy around you that makes the ship briefly invincible and destroys whatever is near it. The game has 50 stages and there are two game modes available: normal game and score attack.</p>",

At first, it is thought to be a military coup d'\u00e9tat because all the weapons and personnel involved belonged to the forces of Earth, though investigations can uncover no motive from the participants nor connect them to each other. After ten more years of seemingly-random attacks on Earth cities by Earth forces, a researcher discovers the existence of an alien species which has been monitoring the planet and using telepathy to seize control of groups of humans in order invoke chaos. Soon thereafter, the aliens increase their assault by turning more of Earth's weapons on each other, seeking the planet's destruction. With few humans left able to act normally under the aliens' power, our protagonist climbs into an experimental ship, codenamed 'Zero', and departs in search of victory...</p>\n<p><em>Code-Zero</em> is a top-down sci-fi shoot-em-up. The player controls a spacecraft at the bottom of the screen and must evade enemy fire while simultaneously destroying enemy ships and tanks. Levels culminate in boss battles against a singular large enemy. Points are awarded for destroying enemy units and counted towards a high score. There are several upgrades which improve the ship's firepower as well as bonus items which award additional points when collected.</p>",
