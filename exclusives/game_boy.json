        "description": "<p>The fourth game in the Zelda series although it does not take place in Hyrule. After being attacked at sea, Link's ship sinks, and he finds himself stranded on Koholint Island. He awakens to see a beautiful woman looking down at him. He soon learns the island has a giant egg on top of a mountain that the Wind Fish inhabits deep inside. Link is told to \"awaken the wind fish and all will be answered,\" so Link sets out on another quest.</p>\n<p>Play is mostly similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6608/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past/\">the SNES game</a> with a top down perspective. However, there are short sections in dungeons where the game switches to a side-scrolling view with platforming elements. Link must go onto each of the 7 temples to retrieve a musical instrument that will help awaken the Wind Fish. Along the way, Link must search the land and uncover hidden treasures and items that will allow him to progress on his journey. With new items, he can open up new passages that will take him even farther on his quest and allow him to enter new areas that were inaccessible before. Link can attack his enemies with his sword or use items he finds during his quest to help him. Guarding every instrument is a temple boss, which must be defeated if Link is to awaken the Wind Fish.</p>",

For example, a piece of iron turns in a glass key when dropped in a pool of fire. Thus, if you want to pass a glass door, you have to find a pool of fire and a piece of iron. These transformations are not random, but sometimes require multiple stages. If you keep good notes, you'll find out all possible transformations.</p>\n<p>The make it all a little bit more interesting, there are monsters inhibiting the maze. That problem is easily solved by transforming something into a decent weapon.</p>",

None dared challenge him, and the people of the country lived in fear and terror - until a young girl rose up and decided to take matters into her own hands. That young girl was Sonia Belmont, the first in the line of the legendary Belmont clan.</p>\n<p>While <em>Castlevania Legends</em> plays similar to the earlier Castlevania titles (the protagonist is only armed with a whip and needs to fight her way through five stages plus a hidden stage), there are also some unique features. While it is impossible to roam the stages freely, quite often the player can choose to go one way or another and in doing so skip some areas or find valuable items, collecting all of which will unlock the best ending. Sonia also possesses special power called Burning mode: once in a level (and once per life) she can boost her speed and attack power and become invincible for a short period of time. </p>\n<p>Each of the game's bosses leaves behind an orb with a Soul weapon inside. Sonia can collect five of these weapons: Wind, Ice, Flame, Saint and Magic. Similar to previous games these are activated by pressing up+attack, and require a certain number of hearts. The player can switch to any Soul Power at any moment at a weapon select screen. Sonia's whip can be upgraded three times, the third upgrade adding a fireball-like projectile.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This game is the first in a series of Game Boy games by Konami based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series of comic books, movies, cartoons, toys, etc.</p>\n<p>The basic premise of the TMNT is this: Four turtles, living in a sewer in New York, are exposed to some radioactive goo. The goo turns them into humanoid creatures and gives them approximately human intelligence. Hence, they are \"mutants.\"  Also, they are teenage turtles, which means they all talk like surfers and like to eat pizza.  An equally mutated, but apparently much older, rat named Splinter acts as the turtle's guardian.  He trains the turtles to be ninjas, and to fight crime.  He also gives the turtle's their names: Michaelangelo, Donatello, Raphael, and Leonardo.</p>\n<p>In the game, the Turtles' TV reporter friend, April, is kidnapped by the evil samurai, Shredder. The turtles must rescue her and defeat Shredder. Gameplay consists of standard side-scrolling jump-and-attack action. Occasionally, hidden bonus games appear to give your turtle bonus health points.</p>",

Shredder and Krang have an evil plot to take over the world, and have kid-napped April. You have to guide the four turtles to rescue her and save the day.</p>\n<p>Back from the Sewers features 6 side-scrolling levels. In between levels, you are treated to bonus games that allow you to increase your health meter or rescue captured turtles.</p>\n<p>The music in the game is a surprisingly accurate rendition of the music found in the cartoon series.  This is also one of the first Game Boy games to feature digitized speech.</p>",

The plot of this Trek is based around a giant \"Doomsday Machine\" that is destroying ships, planets, and other valuable stuff in federation space. The Federation has constructed a weapon to defeat the doomsday machine, but the Klingons think that it will be used against them. So, they steal the weapon and break it up into 12 pieces spread out over 3 planets.</p>\n<p>It is up to the crew of the Enterprise to travel to the 3 planets, recover all 12 pieces of the weapon, and finally stop the Doomsday Machine. There are two modes of game play. First, there is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up in which you pilot the Enterprise through asteroid fields and enemy fleets. Second, there is a overhead-view game in which you maneuver Captain Kirk around the planet to gather up the pieces of the weapon.</p>",

The object of this game is to move Bugs around the 80 levels of a castle and collect all of the carrots. Preventing Bugs' progress are the usual Warner Bros. characters, such as Daffy Duck, Yosemite Sam, and Sylvester. Bugs himself does not have any attack moves, but he can use various objects lying around like anvils and boxing gloves to thwart his enemies.</p>",

So, you start out as Michaelangelo on a quest to rescue your pals and restore justice to the city.</p>\n<p>Radical Rescue differs from the previous Ninja Turtle games greatly in terms of level structure.  The linear levels have been replaced with one huge interconnected fortress.  You progress through the game by finding the various bosses hidden within the fortress, defeating them, and then using the keys they leave behind to open up new rooms.

        "description": "<p>The second in the Final Fantasy Legend series increases the amount of detail over the original in gameplay and graphics.</p>\n<p>The major changes are in the character classes and party members. Similar to FFL, starting a game of Legends II allows you to choose your main character from Humans, Monsters, Mutants and a new class: Robots. From here, you build your party of 4 from the same character classes. During gameplay special side-characters will join you in battle to help defeat certain enemies. </p>\n<p>The other improvement is in strategy. In FFL you gain experience points after each battle, increasing strength, etc. In FFLII, you gain different points and abilities depending on how you defeated the enemy. If you win by using a sword, your strength increases. If you use magic, your mana increases. This adds a more strategic approach to defeating enemies.</p>",

Other major changes compared to the original 2 in the series are the ability to mutate your characters further and a change to the upgrade system.\nItems picked up after battle can be attached to your mutants or humans to turn them into monsters or robots, increasing your parties power and abilities.\nAnd although the original system of obtaning experience points after every battle has been removed, its replacement allows you to choose which magic stone each character can use, so they learn that specific magic type and never lose it.</p>",

The difference is you play as a young vampire rather than a vampire killer.</p>\n<p>Gameplay consists of very standard jump and shoot platform action. As you progress through the 8 levels, you gain the ability to perform spells, like turning into a bat. You will also receive guidance from your pal, the Grim Reaper.</p>",

Homer Simpson spits the beans out the window where they grow into a massive stalk reaching into the clouds.</p>\n<p>The game is a platformer with some shooter elements. The player, as Bart, must jump between platforms and vines through all sorts of tricky hazards to the giant's castle in the clouds and make it back down alive. Bart can use his slingshot and various weapons he finds along the way to defeat the enemies that block his path. There are seven levels in total.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Once upon a time, there was a huge war between the humans and the demons. After prolonged battles, both sides came to an agreement and established peace. But now, things start changing. A demon cult is becoming popular, and demons no longer wish to live in peace with the humans. Only you, the Hero of the game (nameless), aided by the Heroine (also nameless) and other friends, is able to bring peace back to the planet.</p>\n<p>The Heroine has a special ability: she can talk to the demons you meet in random battles and persuade them to join your party. You can store those demons, collect them, and summon them in battles. Demons are divided into various races and species. Otherwise, the game uses a standard turn-based combat with physical attacks and magic spells.</p>\n<p>The game is a part of Megaten universe, but unlike most other Megaten games (with the exception of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Last+Bible\"> Last Bible</a> series), it is set in a medieval world.</p>",

Unlike the more shooter-oriented action on the consoles, this title is played from a top-down perspective, with a greater emphasis on exploration, acquiring items to beat limited puzzles, and survival.</p>\n<p>As Ripley, you must navigate the corridors of the Fury 161 prison, searching for items to aid your escape. Unlike the film it is based on, multiple Aliens are running loose and attacking the prisoners, plus an Alien Queen nesting in the furnace. The player must map out the labyrinthine halls and ventilation systems to easily move around the complex. They must also find weapons to defend Ripley from the Aliens, along with a flamethrower and fuel to torch their eggs. Only after destroying the Queen and her eggs, may Ripley activate the crashed escape pod and leave the planet.</p>",

There is a 5 x 5 grid that these cards are put into. In order to get the cards to disappear a poker hand must be lined up. Hands can only appear vertically or horizontally. The objective is to eliminate all 52 cards. If this is done, you advance to the next level. Levels differ in difficulty by speeding up the descent of the cards and limiting the amount of time you can pause the game to make decisions.</p>",

The game features over 25 levels with 10 sub-levels each one. You can always choose the order in which you want to complete the sub-levels, but you have to complete all sub-levels in order to advance to the next main-level. If you have finished the game or become hopelessly stuck, there is also an option to create your own levels.</p>",

And what better way is there to earn money than pushing crates? And there are lots of crates to be pushed in all 120 levels of the game. The new levels are the major difference between Boxxle 2 and its predecessor as there are no graphical changes to speak of. To solve all these levels, you'll once again have to push crates onto certain spots, which is made difficult by the fact that you can only push but not pull them so that it can easily happen that you push a crate into a dead end or block your own way. A password records your progress, but there is no battery to save your self-created levels.</p>",

The side-scrolling levels play similar to other Jump'N Runs, as you have to avoid obstacles and kill enemies by jumping on them. However, since you are on a skateboard, speed plays an important role, meaning that you cannot immediately stop and sometimes need to drive at full speed to manage wider jumps. The top-down levels play more similar to other Skate Or Die games as gradients influence your driving while you are trying to avoid obstacles, enemies and deadly spikes.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Nail 'n Scale</em> is a mixture of Jump'n Run and puzzle game. The player character can jump and throw nails at his enemies. Apart from killing enemies, nails can also serve as platform when they are thrown into blocks. Some blocks can be destroyed when you throw a nail into them and jump on the nail, whereas other blocks cannot even be penetrated by the nails. As the game progresses, levels get more and more complicated and new types of nails,such as explosive nails that remove particularly resilient blocks, become available.</p>",

Difficulty is increased by the fact that there are crates and holes of several different shapes and sizes and many levels contain different types of spinning doors.</p>\n<p>The game features four different modes of play: Beginners Mode in which the basics are explained and the player receives hints on how to solve each level; Practice Mode that lets the player choose the size of the levels which are then randomly picked; Puzzle Mode in which the player has to complete 40 levels and receives a score depending on the time it took him to complete a level; and finally Action Mode, which is basically a story mode containing two stories. The game also features a password system and four different difficulty levels.</p>",

When the king many years later was released he immediately unleashed legions of regenerating monsters on the citizens of the land. Now a hero (or two if you play it in multiplayer) is needed to defeat him and his minions.</p>\n<p>The game is an action based RPG played with an isometric perspective. As you battle your way through enemy territory you have two weapons, the sword that you start the game with and a Fire Wand that throws fireballs. You will also find some items to use, i.e. a magic axe that can be used to clear blocked passages, chamelon's ring that makes you part of the terrain and shield to help in defense.</p>",

The levels scroll in all directions and hostages are spread out over the whole area. Your helicopter takes damage from enemies such as planes, birds or ordnance; but also from contact with buildings and hills. To finish a level, you have to rescue a given number of hostages; saving more hostages than required gains you extra points. If you take too much damage, you'll lose a live. For losing too many hostages, you'll instantly lose a continue, regardless of how many lives you have left.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Tamagotchi: Osutchi &amp; Mesutchi is a Japanese only version of the popular virtual pet series of games.  The Game Boy game is based on the Osutchi &amp; Mesutchi versions of the virtual pet, which have both male and female versions which are able to mate with each other.</p>\n<p>The game lets you raise a Tamagotchi by taking care of it by feeding it, playing with it, and so on.  There are three special mini-games that you can play with your Tamagotchi: a memory match game, rock-paper-scissors, and a beach-themed race to the finish.  There are also other mini-games to play that don't involve your Tamagotchi.</p>\n<p>Players can also take their pets to different locations, such as the beach and out in a park.  The game also keeps a record of all the Tamagotchis you have encountered.</p>\n<p>Like an actual Tamagotchi, the game cartridge has a built-in alarm which can be turned on or off.  This alarm is used to indicate when your pet needs attention, such as when it is sick, has gone to the toilet, or needs to be fed.</p>",

Eggs can be used to cross water, trap enemies or block their shots. In some levels, collecting two heart frames gives Lolo access to one of three items.

Gameplay mostly consists of running, jumping and climbing through the large platform-like levels. However, in the jungles and caves of the island, many enemies await: Both various dinosaur species, including Tyrannosaurus Rex and Velociraptor, and human enemies, employees of InGen's rival BioSyn. The player can defend himself by using kicks and punches, a pistol or a grenade launcher. Ammo and health power-ups can be found in boxes scattered around the levels.</p>",

It's up to Attila and Genghis to eat their way through sixteen tricky stages as they avoid nasty traps and open the exits by standing on the scales to open the exit door.</p>\n<p><em>Sneaky Snakes</em> is a pseudo-sequel to the NES game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/11270/snake-rattle-n-roll/\">Snake, Rattle 'n Roll</a>. However, instead of an isometric playfield, the game is this time a standard sidescrolling platformer. Players can play as Attila (or link up and play simultaneously with a friend as Genghis) through various devious levels. The goal of each level is to eat enough Nibbleys (round creatures which come in assorted flavors including balloons, jellyfish, joggers, and more) to earn enough tail segments. When your snake has enough segments, its body will flash, and you can weigh yourself to open the exit gate and progress to the next level.</p>\n<p>Each level has a time limit of 99 seconds - if this runs out, a giant ax will appear, chasing after your snake until it eventually destroys it. To prevent this from occurring, you can collect clocks which add another 30 seconds to your time limit. You can also collect power ups such as increased jump height, tongue extensions, and diamonds which briefly make you invincible.</p>",

He must fight, shoot and jump his way through five levels of cronies to face the man himself. Some sections involve negotiating platforms and window sills far above the street, while others involve walking at street level while dodging safes that criminals attempt to drop on you from windows. In all cases, Dick can pummel enemies into submission with his fists or find and use a hand gun, tommy gun or tear gas. The weapons all have very limited ammunition.</p>",

He has to defeat an army of ghosts in a series of environments, including construction site, sewer, airship, jungle, and finally, the headquarters where he meets the evil ghost building machine. Rather than using his mallet, Harry can obtain a spiked ball which does more damage than the mallet. There are five stages, and each one ends with Harry fighting a boss. Upon completion of a stage, the gameplay switches from a beat-em-up to a horizontal shooter where Harry flies through the air, defeating airborne enemies and avoiding dangerous objects.</p>",

However, when the Predators move in for the hunt, they find they are vastly outnumbered and suffer the same fate. Only one of them survives. He theorizes that among the hatched Aliens there was a queen that laid additional eggs, which would explain the huge number of Aliens. The last survivor sets out to destroy the queen and regain the honor of his clan.</p>\n<p>The Predator must traverse several side-scrolling levels on his way to the queen, while destroying Aliens in all their forms - facehuggers hatched from eggs, chestburster aliens and fully grown warriors. Various weapons are available: the standard weapon are the wrist blades. Ammunition for the shoulder cannon, the cutting disks and bombs must be picked up. The bombs not only work as weapons but can also be used to destroy barriers. To avoid a fight altogether, the Predator can also use his invisibility system, which runs down the energy supply. To recharge it, energy powerups must be collected. Also hidden in the levels are keys that open up doors blocking the way into the next area. A small radar map helps in navigating the maze-like corridors and also displays approaching enemies.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Terminator 2: Judgement Day</em> is a game based on the movie of the same name. The Game Boy version is unlike the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=NES-62-USA\">console</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=5013156016585\">computer versions</a> of the game. The game takes place in two time periods: 2029, when the Terminators have taken over the world, and 1994, when John Connor is ten years old and his future self has reprogrammed a Terminator to protect him from a more advanced model.</p>\n<p>In the early levels of the game, you play as the future John Connor - your objectives are to destroy generators to gain access to Skynet. Once inside, you must make your way through Skynet and obtain a Terminator yourself. These levels are played in a side-scrolling fashion. The next level is a difficult puzzle - you must reprogram the Terminator so that it will protect John Connor instead of killing him. You need to realign the wires so that power cells can reach their destinations and reset the program.</p>\n<p>Once you pass this level, you take on the role of the Terminator in 1994. You must protect John Connor while on a motorbike being chased by the T-1000. Later levels include infiltrating Cyberdyne to obtain the previous Terminator's arm and chip, and the final showdown with the T-1000 at the steel mill.</p>",

The A button fires your gun and the B button throws grenades.</p>\n<p>The object is to kill the bad guys who either are walking around or hiding in the environment while also picking up ammo, grenades and health by shooting them. Your health is constantly drained while enemies are shooting, so if you want to last, you must cap them as soon as they appear.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Superman</em> is a sidescrolling action game starring DC Comics' titular Man of Steel. It features character designs based on <em>Superman: The Animated Series</em>. In each level, the player must collect a certain number of keys and possibly fight a boss, then step on a marked area to leave. Keys may be found around in the environment or collected from defeated enemies.</p>\n<p>Superman attacks by punching his enemies or by punching to deflect their bullets back at them. He can navigate environments through standard walking or he can hold down the jump button to fly. He must be careful of bombs which are floating throughout the levels as running into them causes loss of health. He also must face other environmental hazards, like electrical barriers.</p>\n<p>Some levels put ground under Superman's feet and play some like a normal platforming/fighting game, albeit with flight. Others are all flying and forced scrolling, making them something like a 2D shooter with no ranged attack where the player must hold down a fly button to stay aloft.</p>",

As Mr. Chin, you can drop bowls on the ground with the B Button.  If you place one bowl on the left and one on the right, a laser will fire between the two bowls, and any enemies will be caught between, transforming into peaches.  Mr. Chin can then gobble up the peaches - if he grabs more in a row, their value increases (Mr. Chin's score is measured in calories).  When Mr. Chin eats all the enemies on-screen, more quickly take their place.  Gobble them all up, and when there are no more enemies in the level, you can progress to the next one.</p>\n<p>Enemies in the levels can walk on thin line paths, but Mr. Chin will fall through these - he can only walk on bricks.  Mr. Chin can also smash the bricks by punching them from underneath - sometimes this will reveal a power up, such as invincibility and the ability to turn all foes into peaches instantly.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>A powerful human called Krond conquers the Monster Planet, bans all music and declares himself king. Max, a monster rock musician decides to fight back. In order to defeat the evil monarch, he enlists in the training course at the Mega Hero Academy.</em>\n<strong>Monster Max</strong> is a surreal isometric adventure by the same duo that created the 8-bit classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Head+Over+Heels\">Head Over Heels</a>. Not surprisingly it is very similar to that game in terms of control and general design, and almost identical graphically. The character moves on a bizarre landscape, where he has to collect and use objects (with either the <strong>A</strong> or <strong>B</strong> button) to accomplish mission objectives. The game starts on a training academy that serves as the mission hub. Each mission has as an entrance with a terminal and a door. By touching the terminal with the character, the mission objective and reward is displayed on the screen. The missions available can be played in any order, but Max has to pay a fee to access other levels with more advanced missions. On the top left of the screen there is a counter for the lucky stars collected. Lucky stars allow the character to touch dangerous objects once without suffering damage. Besides that are several hearts representing the number of lives. On the top right is the inventory display, showing the two objects assigned to the buttons. Hitting <strong>START</strong> while on a mission brings up a map, while pressing <strong>SELECT</strong> displays a menu with options and the password at the bottom of the screen.</p>\n<p>The game is far larger than previous isometric adventures like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/14733/knight-lore/\">Knight Lore</a>, with over 600 more detailed locations (the double of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Head+Over+Heels\">Head Over Heels</a>). There is a password system to save progress.</p>",

But whereas that title was a beat-em-up, <em>Hakaishin Garumaa</em> instead takes place as a turn-based board game RPG. Similar in design to the later <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/1765/mario-party-series/\">Mario Party</a> titles, players begin by choosing one of three of the undercover cops. The player begins at the start location of the board and must use one of their \"numbered value tiles\". If the number chosen is above 1, the player must compete on a slot machine to try to win a value up to what was written on the tile. Following that, the player is able to move the number value, which they have won, of spaces on the board. Certain squares will activate events that include talking with characters, buying items and engaging in battle.</p>\n<p>Battles with enemies are handled by each side choosing one of the numbered tiles they own. The party with the higher number becomes the attacker and the lower value becomes the defender. Each side then chooses another numbered tile to determine the amount of \"effort\" put into the attack or defense as well as a position of the body to attack/defend. With that chosen, the turn's sequence plays out, with HP lost on a successful impact. Upon defeating an opponent in battle, the player gains XP and gold.</p>",

The game follows the movie's basic plot: Bill and Ted, two not too bright teenagers, absolutely have to pass their history paper. Rufus, a man from the future, grants them a device for time-travelling and so they visit the past to bring historical figures into their own time.</p>\n<p>This is a single-screen platformer reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/80/jumpman/\">Jumpman</a>. In each level, the goal is to collect a few flashing objects and reach the exit (which is hidden until everything is collected). Of course there are various challenges to master first: platforming (complicated by obstacles like conveyor belts or disappearing platforms) and avoiding enemies with different behaviour patterns. Power-ups like temporary invulnerability or balloons to reach higher platforms can be activated at will after they have been collected. There are overall 50 levels (divided into ten time zones) to visit.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Loosely based on the movie of the same name, <em>Ghostbusters II</em> sees Virgo the Carpathian appear in New York city. He captures Diana's baby and it is up to the Ghostbusters to get him back. In order to accomplish this, the Ghostbusters: Igon, Ray, Peter and Winston, must chase Virgo through the courtrooms, the sewers, the apartments, the underground and the art museum.</p>\n<p><em>Ghostbusters II</em> is a top-view action game based off of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/23497/new-ghostbusters-ii/\">New Ghostbusters II</a> (the second <em>Ghostbusters II</em> license on NES) but with enough differences to be unique. Players begin by choosing two of the four ghostbusters, who all play the exact same. The first one selected is controlled by the player directly and carries a proton pack, the second ghostbuster is follows the first and carries the ghost trap. The objective of each level is to capture a predefined number of ghosts before the timer expires. The player moves up, down, left and right. One button will fire the proton gun directly in front of the first ghostbuster, stunning any ghosts. The second button will toss the trap directly in front of the second ghostbuster, trapping any stunned ghosts. While exploring the levels, any of the 2 remaining ghostbusters (as well as the ghostbusters' accountant Louis) not currently being used will occasionally show up. Touching them will provide power-ups (and often swap with a selected Ghostbuster) including vacuum guns, instant traps and invulnerability.</p>",

Powerful and deadly, the mech seems to have a mind of its own, and agrees to join Tony on the quest to find his sister.</p>\n<p>The side-scrolling shooter pits you against a host of different alien creatures across the galaxy. You'll start inside the mech itself, collecting weapon upgrades along the way to increase your chances of defeating the alien scum. But be careful, if you're hit by them, you'll lose the safety of the mech and be all by yourself.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The very first installment of the <em>Super Robot Taisen</em> series is quite different from all of its successors; most notably, the robots are treated as sentient organisms, and all pilots are absent from the game. As the intro tells, they live on the planet of super robots, when a mysterious space creature know as Gil Gil Gan takes control of most the planet's inhabitants and launch a destructive war.</p>\n<p>The basic interface is like every other <em>SRT</em> game: your robots are placed out on a map grid with different terrain types. Placing the cursor above a robot and pushing a button brings up a menu with basic choices for movement, attack, status and special options. A similar menu is displayed if you move your robot close to an enemy unit, offering options to attack, use spiritual powers or negotiate. After all robots have moved, the turn is over, and the game switches to the enemy phase.</p>\n<p>All robots are licensed from two parties only \u2013 Sunrise and Dynamic \u2013 and when starting the game you may choose to start with the Gundam team, the Mazinger team or the Getter Robo team. One robot must be designated as the team leader, which allows you to upgrade its statistics with a number of points. If the leader robot is destroyed in battle, the game is over. Unlike later games, destroyed units are not repaired after a scenario is cleared, but may show up as an enemy unit later on. This puts a lot more emphasis on the negotiation command than later games, since a lot more enemy units may in fact turn out to be friends. Few of them will listen unless you have first brought down their HP to a minimal amount, though.</p>\n<p>Apart from HP, each unit has XP. Experience is gained for each enemy unit that is destroyed, and a level up adds to all aspects of your robot; speed, force, armor, HP and SP. SP, or spiritual power, is like MP in conventional RPGs, allowing a unit-specific set of \u201dspiritual commands\u201d to be executed. These usually change game variables, such as force of attack, speed of dodging or health. Health is otherwise regenerated by putting a unit in one of the bases spread out on each map. When first entering a base, you gain a power-up item. These are fitted to your robots between scenarios and include new weapons and shields.</p>\n<p>Each battle is displayed as a small animation, but it is all very primitive compared to later games in the series, even on the Game Boy, with little movement apart from the bullets and lasers. Preceding each battle you have initiated yourself, you may choose your weapon. Weapons may be hand-to-hand or ranged. Ranged weapons are advantageous since your opponent may not fire back \u2013 this is true even of enemy units which possess ranged weapons of their own. All weapons have also properties for their accuracy and power, which are altered according to the terrain and whether enemies are at sea, on the ground or airborne.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Q Billion</em>, you play a mouse which must level out a playfield filled with stacks of tiles. To do this, the mouse must climb onto one stack and push a taller, neighbouring stack so that tiles fall off, until there are no tiles stacked on top of each other. Oftentimes, there stacks are not adjacent to each other, which forces the mouse to push a tile next to the stack in order to have something to stand on. Since the mouse is so weak, it can only move a single tile. This calls for a lot of juggling, since in order to move a stack of three tiles (represented by a 3 in a square), it must move a single tile next to a stack of two tiles, then move another tile to the other side of the small stack and push the uppermost tile of the stack onto the single tile in order to create a stack of two next to the stack of three. If there is a distance greater than one or two squares between the stacks, it makes the task daunting and requires a lot of planning, which puts this game straight into the old style of Japanese puzzles pioneered by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Sokoban\">Sokoban</a>.</p>\n<p>Later stages introduce tiles of different kinds, symbolised by hearts, squares or stars. These tiles will, when moved together in groups of four, be eliminated; or at least the uppermost layer will. This calls for three-dimensional \u2013 or even four-dimensional \u2013 thinking on behalf of the player. None of the special tiles must be left on the screen for the stage to be cleared.</p>\n<p>A second gaming mode contains ready-made puzzles which must be solved in a limited amount of time. An editing mode will also allow the player to create levels of his own.</p>",

Feeding the compressor too much will deplete your fuel, though, so everything must be balanced for the lift-off to be successful.</p>\n<p><strong>Landing:</strong> This stage is very similar to the old <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Lunar+Lander\">Lunar Lander</a> type of game that was popular in the early eighties. From a map of the moon, you select one of eight landing sites. On the landing screen, you must carefully guide your lander through the cave-like craters to the landing pads. Different landing pads are worth different amounts of points, according to level of difficulty. Preserving your lander's fuel will also give bonus points. Unlike most typical Lander games, your craft has no rockets for going left or right \u2013 instead you must rotate your lander and ignite the single landing rocket in order to adjust your angle. There are also meteorites to watch out for.</p>\n<p><strong>Exploration:</strong> Once you have landed, an astronaut steps out on the surface, armed with a metal detector. Your task here is to find five different kinds of metal ore and bring them to the lander before you run out of air or time. The metal detector beeps with different frequencies according to your vicinity to a piece of metal. If there is a constant beep, you drill for the metal. If you drill elsewhere, you may find flowers that replenish your air supply. To complicate things, the moon surface is filled with robots that try to hunt you down. Contact with a robot wears down your air supply. </p>\n<p>After you have landed and explored all eight areas, your mission is completed and you proceed to the next one, which is more of the same.</p>",

You must also take an active part in dodging attacks by pressing appropriate buttons at the right moments (similar to NBA Live 1-point shots, but with a bar instead of a cross). Also, there's a tournament mode, in which you will take the side of Goku as he fought in the 23rd Tenkaichi Bud\u014dkai in the Dragon Ball series.</p>",

The gameplay is very simillar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/34485/dragon-ball-z-goku-hishoden/\">Dragon Ball Z: Gok\u016b Hish\u014dden</a>, although with some notable differences, as players now have a limited amount of time while choosing a sequence of actions for each turn. Next, the battle will take place in a small map with the heads of the two characters moving around the quadrilater, and a graphic representation of what the characters are doing is illustrated above through anime-like drawings. Next characters need to charge power, aim and attack. A hit damage value shows up on the screen after each impact suffered.</p>",

Experience the action as pitchers battle it out against a lineup of heavy hitters using fast, slow, curving and special pitches. Each player brings their own unique stats and abilities to the game as you work your way through progressively more challenging teams.</p>\n<p>This portable version of <em>Bases Loaded</em> is loosely based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=032264900017\">title</a> for the original NES. In this scaled down version Major League teams are replaced with two teams representing the East and West Coast Divisions. With two Game Boy units and a Video Link cable players can go head to head - although each player will also need their own game cartridge. Single players can enjoy a quick pickup game by selecting an unofficial game of 1 to 9 innings. An official game will allow a victorious team to move on to consecutive matches against progressively more challenging teams, a feature that substitutes for the traditional 'Season Mode' of most baseball titles. But you'll have to do this in a single sitting as no battery save option was included.</p>\n<p>Play in USA or Japan mode for a subtle change in the gameplay or learn how to best utilize the strengths of the East and West teams. Pitchers are rated 1 to 5 and batters get a rating for both running speed and hitting ability.</p>",

The game world is divided in several screens which can be freely navigated and are a little wider than the Game Boy's screen. As Dirk moves the screen will scroll and when its limit is reached, it will flick to a new one. To help him move around, Dirk can jump over bumper cars, flying magic hats and other kinds of moving platforms.</p>\n<p>Dirk starts with 10 lives which can be lost by falling from high platforms, touching spikes or landing on water or fire. The main theme is somewhat reminiscent from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/22587/dragons-lair/\">NES version</a>.

You must guide your tank to the end of each stage by arranging boxes with a hook attached to the bottom of your plane, as well as by shooting enemy planes and batteries that threaten it. The tank will roll forward on its own and climb up any wall that is only a single block high -- anything taller and it will crash into it and turn around, taking damage. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed and the game is over. If you get hit, you lose a plane, and if you run out of planes, the game will also be over.</p>\n<p>There are several special items to help you on your way, including a power hook that allows you to directly carry the tank, a bomb that can destroy all enemies on the screen, and an option that makes a second plane follow yours and mimic your actions.</p>\n<p>The game features ten stages, as well as a 2-player cooperative mode (two planes) when played via link cable.</p>",

There are no weapons that can be used, instead the player must rely on kicks and punches to dispatch enemies and pick up health items left behind.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Yellow, Black, Pink Rangers are extremely fast and can jump into higher areas but are more weaker than Blue, Red, White Rangers who are much stronger, but lack the speed and jumping abilities of the other Rangers.  Players can refill their health by picking up heart icons and power icons to increase their morphing meter.  Once filled, the morphing meter will increase the Rangers power, attack capabilities, speed and jumping abilities.</p>",

The money needed to keep the park up and running for the winter has been stolen by an evil ghost named Jake, determined to shut down the park, and hidden by him in twelve safes somewhere in the park.  The player must travel to six different locations to locate these safes (a forest, a pirate ship, the big city, an underground cavern, the old west and a final showdown with Jake).</p>\n<p>The gameplay is fairly simple: using Yogi, the player can travel from left to right and right to left on the screen; to kill certain enemies the hero must jump on them. Some enemies, however, can't be killed and must be avoided since Yogi has no weapons to harm them; he has to avoid various pitfalls and hazards as well.</p>\n<p>There are no true power-ups; instead, there are picnic baskets scattered throughout the stage, a 100 of which will grant the player an extra life.  Likewise, there are icons labeled \"1-UP\" that will give the player a life, as well as health-refilling items. There are also hidden doors and areas that the player must find in order to locate the various safes. When Yogi enters these safes, he must collect the 25 gold coins to get a bar of gold; collecting 12 of these gold bars will give Yogi the money needed to win the game.</p>",

While it does feature the full NBA license including team names and logos, it doesn't feature any real players names, but instead authentic numbers instead. There are also only two default colors for teams (black &amp; white) and features a limited set of offensive and defensive plays that can be selected.</p>\n<p>It does feature an <em>Exhibition</em>, <em>Season</em> and <em>Playoff</em> mode, however in playoffs the player is automatically assigned a team and cannot choose their own. Players can also features three difficulty modes and the ability to change around in game options such as game time limits and customizing rules.</p>",

These nine wrestlers consist of Rick Rude, Ron Simmons, Steve Austin, Sting, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, Big Van Vader and The Steiner Brothers (Rick &amp; Scott).</p>\n<p>The gameplay is similar to the many others with a side scrolling look where players can either punch or kick their opponents or climb the ropes and perform a flying maneuver to decimate their opponents. Players also can use their signature move once it has become available to use against their opponent in an attempt to win the match.</p>\n<p>Players can either compete in a single exhibition match or compete in an Elimination match where they face off against each wrestler in succession for a chance to become WCW World Heavyweight Champion. There is also two-player capabilities utilizing the Game Boy Link Cable.</p>",

In various side-scrolling levels, Kuros must dodge obstacles such as arrows and flames, as well as kill different enemies such as bats, spiders, warriors and skeletons. To damage his enemies, Kuros can use two different attacks: a fast stab attack and a strike that is slower, but has a better range.</p>\n<p>Various items that help Kuros on his quest can be picked up throughout the levels: gems increase the player's score and grant extra lives, food replenishes some health, a spell of invincibility makes Kuros temporarily invincible, and keys are used to open treasure chests or doors. Kuros can also find additional equipment including a \"Shield of Protection\" that halves the damage he receives, and the \"Boots of Jumping\" that let him jump higher and fall from high platforms without taking damage. Levels are divided into several sub-levels, at the last of which a boss fight awaits Kuros.</p>",

But the way to the castle is filled with obstacles and creatures who Sethron has turned to the path of evil.</p>\n<p>Baby T-Rex is a very traditional platform game where you run and jump to get to the end of the stage. There are a total of 4 \"worlds\", each with 3 stages and a final boss stage. The game play is fast paced, with slides and skateboards passages for added speed. You can find stones and bowling balls to throw at the enemies. There are also power-ups to replenish health, obtain extra lives and gain invincibility.</p>\n<p>Baby T-Rex was reskinned for several releases in other territories, <em>We're Back: A Dinosaur's Story</em> (North America), based on the film of the same name; <em>Bamse</em> (Sweden), based on the Swedish cartoon character; and <em>Agro Soar</em> (Australia), based on the Australian television character Agro. Only vital elements such as the main character sprites and background story were changed, otherwise the games are identical.</p>",

Computer and Vs. Human. The story mode is slightly different from the console version, featuring a different unlockable final boss.</p>\n<p>As in the console version, battles can be won either by depleting the adversary's life bar or by tossing him or her out of the ring. Each character has its own special moves and a desperation move (which can only be used when the character has 10% or less of his or her health).</p>",

        "description": "<p>The crossover of the two 80s Action/Sci-Fi franchises comes to the Game Boy in this platform title, based very loosely on a Dark Horse comic.</p>\n<p>The player controls RoboCop, who, while taking care of law &amp; order in Detroit, discovers some unusual troublemakers: Terminators sent from the future. To deal with the threat, Robo will have to make his way through an OCP factory and computer complex, where a time machine awaits that will take him to the post-nuclear wasteland of future Los Angeles. There, he must destroy the Skynet mainframe to free humanity from the machines once and for all.</p>\n<p>The game is a platforming affair. RoboCop must destroy various enemies while looking for the level exit, from various criminals in Detroit to advanced robotic probes, Terminators and flying Hunter Killers in the OCP labs and the future. He is armed with a simple gun which can be upgraded once to a three-directional scatter shot. A single hit means the gun upgrade is lost, though. Life energy can be refilled through power-ups, and extra lives are also available.</p>",

You must run around on brick platforms gathering all the gold, while avoiding enemies, known as Mad Monks, who follow your every move. You can zap blocks to create temporary holes to trap enemies or to escape through to platforms below. To make levels more interesting there are ladders and vertical ropes to climb, but the enemies can use these too.</p>\n<p>There are 50 levels to play, and there is also a VS mode and a level editor that gives the possibility to create up to four levels each with the timed sub-levels but unfortunately without any possibility to save them.</p>",

You control a succession of the USA's elite fighters with the aim of destroying missiles held by terrorists. You must work your way through levels and find the exit to get to the next level. At the beginning and end of each level, there is a cut scene which consists of a still image with text, to progress the story of the game.</p>\n<p>You will of course meet many more fighters throughout the level, and pick up improved weapons as the game goes on. The gameplay is fairly standard platform work, seen in many other Ocean movie tie-ins.</p>\n<p>The Game Boy version of this game differs from the home computer version released around the same time. The level layout is different, there are no ladders ladders or ropes and you don't have to place bombs.</p>",

Battles are shown as small animated sequences.</p>\n<p>Building (and repairing) units requires income, which is generated by occupying cities or production facilities. What units can be constructed where depends on the building type: factories and cities build land units, airports and harbors are required for air and sea units, respectively.</p>\n<p>The game offers a battery-based save game feature even in the midst of playing a map, as well as a two-player feature, with two players sharing a Game Boy and taking turns.</p>",

The player takes the role of Gomez who searches for his missing family members. To find them he has to explore six different parts of the mansion, e.g. the forest or the graveyard, which are basic platform levels: the player moves from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies. In contrast to the other versions of the game he has weapons to his disposal, e.g. a throwing knife. Other differences are a unique level design and another health system: Gomez has five hearts which practically act like a life meter because every hit only takes away a part of a heart.</p>",

        "description": "<p>An egg arrives from a far-off planet in outer space. This egg contains a 'Tamagotchi', a baby alien that cannot fend for itself, and requires your attention and care. Look after the Tamagotchi and help it grow up.</p>\n<p><em>Tamagotchi</em> is a game based on the popular virtual pet of the same name. In it, you select an egg from the laboratory, and then it hatches in its room. From there, you are fully responsible for its care. Everything from feeding, medicine, playing with it, cleaning up its poo and scolding or praising it when appropriate - you must do it all.</p>\n<p>Unlike the actual Tamagotchi toy, the Game Boy version is not in realtime - you can adjust the Tamagotchi's growth speed in the game options. You can also look after up to three Tamagotchis simultaneously. The Game Boy version also features three different games to play with your pet - depending on the game you select, it will improve their mood, their intelligence, or their physical fitness. The three games are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smile Game - Your pet will look left and right. Try to guess which direction it will face next.</li>\n<li>Study Game - Help your Tamagotchi study. Simple math questions will appear and you must help it answer them.</li>\n<li>Sports Game - Keep your Tamagotchi fit. Baseballs will rain down from the sky. Get your pet to them before they hit the floor to score a point.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another feature exclusive to the Game Boy version are Tournaments. You can enter your pet in Race, Beauty and Knowledge tournaments. You can increase your chances of winning in these by training your pet, but make sure that when you enter them that it's not sick or spoiled, as it will not perform as well as it could. Win a tournament and your Tamagotchi will be placed in the Hall of Fame.</p>",

You must, using your bombs, blow him up without getting blown up yourself. After you beat him, the process repeats with two Bombermen then three Bombermen.</p>\n<p>After you beat the three Bombermen in two out of three rounds, you must beat a boss character to move on. When playing the rounds, you can find power-ups to increase the blast size, allow more than one bomb on the screen and, temporarily, make you invincible. When you beat the bosses, you gain things like the ability to kick a bomb away, run faster, ram enemies, etc.</p>\n<p>In a multi-player game, two to four players do their best to blow each other up. Multi-player is done with the Super Game Boy on a SNES. More than two players is only possible with a multitap.</p>\n<p>This game was released in the U.S. as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Wario+Blast\">Wario Blast</a>, with some changes. The animated opening was removed and, of course, Wario was added.</p>",

Prince Valiant must lead Arthur's armies against the Tyrant Cynan. The goal is to capture all his castles or defeat all his armies.</p>\n<p>A giant over-map shows the world and is divided in tiles. Each tiles has different terrain and shows whether units or castles are present in a tile. Tiles are either white or gray depending on whether Arthur or Cynan controls it.</p>\n<p>Characters on the map can be directly controlled after being selected. This happens in a top-down view similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3393/the-legend-of-zelda/\">The Legend of Zelda</a>. Characters can attack and jump. Each character has different attacks. Items can be collected and the player can move freely between tiles. Moving through tiles that are occupied by the enemy conquers those territories, but the enemy can take them back at any time by moving through them again. If two enemy units meet on the same tile, combat ensues. In real time the player must try to defeat the AI opponent. This is done through dodging his attack and trying to land a blow. To conquer a castle all enemies including those in adjacent tiles must be defeated. </p>\n<p>It is also possible to find and collect items in the direct control mode. Items serve as power-ups that for example make the player faster or restore health points.The player can return to a castle at any time to heal completely.</p>\n<p>The player can select the size of the world to increase or decrease the game's length. Additionally he or she and change the difficulty of the AI player (Cynan) and select a handicap for himself. It is also possible to play against another player.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Real Ghostbusters</em>, known as <em>Garfield Labyrinth</em> in Europe and <em>Mickey Mouse IV: Mahou no Labyrinth</em> in Japan, is a puzzle/platform game. The story is very simple: Venkman (or Garfield and Odie or Mickey and Mini Mouse, depending on the version you play) walk over a bridge one day, a tile breaks loose and Venkman/Garfield/Mickey falls down a deep pit, which ends up in a bizarre labyrinth, which Venkman/Garfield/Mickey must escape. There's no other goal apart from that, the player just needs to find the exit in each level. Apart from getting there, the exit must also be unlocked. For the latter, the player must collect all gems in the level.</p>\n<p>Each level contains various traps and enemies which need to be avoided. The puzzles involve finding keys to lower bridges or open doors, make use of teleporters and especially: drilling away blocks. Conveniently, the player finds a pneumatic hammer at the beginning of the game, which must be used to create paths to certain areas and items, without blocking the way forth or back. There's also an inventory to store items like keys and bombs (used to kill enemies). The protagonist has a health bar and can take several hits before losing a life, but there is also a time limit for each level.</p>\n<p>The game features a password system, a password is given automatically after completing a level.</p>\n<p>In spite of the differences in main character and a minor variation in the short intro cinematic all regional versions are identical.</p>\n<p>The levels are copied from the Amiga game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/16607/p-p-hammer-and-his-pneumatic-weapon/\">P. P. Hammer and His Pneumatic Weapon</a>, with some changes due to the limitations of the Game Boy.</p>",

All of a sudden, Rash and Pimple are kidnapped and as Zitz, you must chase after the Dark Queen while evading the many enemies blocking your inter-galactic path.</p>\n<p>You control Zitz, the Battletoad. In some levels, you must walk along, beating up any enemies that you encounter. In other levels, you are flying or racing along, shooting or avoiding enemies. At the end of each level, there is a boss battle. While it shares the same name and main characters as the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6134/battletoads/\">other versions</a>, the levels and most enemies in this version differ greatly.</p>",

The goal is the same as the game show, which is to guess missing letters to solve a puzzle which covers the same subjects as found on the show, such as place, person, thing, phrase, etc. Like the game show, the players spin the wheel, select consonants, buy vowels and hopefully, solve the mystery phrase. The wheel can be \"spun\" at different strengths by sliding a bar across a selector, and the chances of earning a free spin, losing a turn, and going bankrupt remain.</p>\n<p>Game play is for up to two players taking turns, or for one player against the computer. Gameplay moves through three rounds, and a bonus round for a grand prize. Winning is accomplished, essentially, by earning the most money and winning the game by solving the phrases.</p>\n<p>There is even a \"sexy model\" that animates out onto the \"stage\" -- though the resemblance to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/368175/vanna-white/\">Vanna White</a> is minimal at best.</p>",

The single player mode called \"Game B\" has the classical Bomberman gameplay, while the mode \"Game A\" introduces several variations. The levels in Game A are divided in nine areas, which can be accessed in any order from a world map. Depending on the time taken to finish a level and the number of blocks destroyed, the player gets a certain amount of gold, which can be used to buy power-ups (called \"panels\" in the game) in shop, which in term is accessed from the map. Power-ups allow, for example, to revive Bomberman when he dies in a stage or to increase the length of an explosion. Before entering a new area, the player chooses which panels to use in order to complete the area.</p>\n<p>The multiplayer mode are both player vs. player modes. In \"Panel mode\", each player can place only one bomb at a time and the bombs' radius starts at one, but panels appear in the field to improve this. In \"Powerful mode\", no panels appear, but each player can place up to four bombs at a time and the radius is four.</p>",

It is 1985, 3 years before the events of the NES game, and Jaquio has not yet been awakened. However, Emperor Garuda, an evil dictator, threatens New York city and it is up to the Ryu Hayabusa to fight him.</p>\n<p>This game is an action side-scroller. Ryu can run, jump and beat his enemies using a sword. He also has a grappling-hook device, which can be used to reach higher platforms, which can then be hand-climbed across. By collecting power ups Ryu can use a magical technique called \"the art of the fire wheel\", an ascending and spinning wheel of fire which will take more damage than his usual sword. He has up to 5 charges of this technique. Ryu has a life meter with six units, which can be replenished by finding proper power ups inside containers.</p>\n<p>The game is divided in 5 stages. Each stages has sub-screens, and the main objective is to go from left to right till the end of the screen, destroying the enemies in the way. Among the enemies Ryu will find humans, cyborgs and machines. At the end of each stage a boss fight awaits Ryu.</p>",

Using the punch attack the player can destroy bricks. When destroyed, some bricks will reveal spinach which can be collected. The number of collected spinach determines the size of Popeye's fist. When Popeye is hit by an enemy the size of his fist decreases again. The player can collect a maximum of seven cans of spinach at which point the player gains a ranged attack where it shoots spinach cans. When the player loses all spinach, he dies. Each series of levels is concluded with a level boss.</p>",

Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=%0A047875441385\">Shanghai series published under Activision</a>, this port contains only a single game layout, that of the standard setup sometimes referred to as \"The Turtle\" or \"The Pyramid.\"</p>\n<p>The game features two options for the visual style of the facecards, either in small designs or in simple letters or numbers. The former is more decorative, but the latter is easier to read. There are also three options for background music that may be selected under a menu by pressing the Select button. Like other versions of <em>Shanghai</em>, there is also a hint mode for when players get stuck.</p>",

It features three classes of open-wheel cars (which dub as difficulty levels), three game modes (practice, single race and championship) and 25 different tracks all around the world, with some of them only playable on the according championship, from the Japanese Formula 3 to the World F1 Grand Prix. On each class, tracks become longer (forcing pit stops), cars faster, and turns change from simple, low angle corners which require no more than a slight trajectory to elbow corners which require some skill to turn without losing speed. </p>\n<p>Controls are simple, with the directional button steering the car and the B button used to throttle the car and A to change between high and low gear.</p>",

The European version (<em>Winter Gold</em>) does not feature the license, but is otherwise the same game.</p>\n<p>The player can compete for one of 20 different nations in 7 different events: downhill skiing, biathlon, ski jumping, bobsleigh, slalom skiing, short track ice skating and freestyle moguls. Each discipline can be practiced on its own before the actual competition. Competition can either be the full set, only the first or last half, only the downhill disciplines, or without the downhill disciplines.</p>\n<p>Controls and perspectives differ by event: the downhill ski events are shown in isometric perspective. The athlete's course is controlled relative to the screen. He can crouch to accelerate and also put the skis together to brake. Jumps in freestyle and ski jumping are triggered through the buttons. Biathlon is seen from a side-scrolling perspective. The buttons are used to accelerate, taking into account the athlete's constitution indicated by a heart meter. The shooting is done by moving a crosshair over the targets and pushing a button. Short track is seen from a top-down perspective, with the athlete's movements controlled through alternating pushes of left and right on the d-pad. Bobsleigh is seen from a third-person 3D perspective behind the sleigh.</p>",

RoboCop can also employ a a jetpack to fly around the levels.</p>\n<p>Aside from enemies there are also other hazards such as falling bombs, electricity and rolling barrels. </p>\n<p>In between normal levels the player can expect boss fights and a sliding puzzle with mugshots.</p>",

The player will find him/herself in the Carbonated Forest on a map screen much like that of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7300/super-mario-bros-3/\">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>. Each sub level has baddies such as snails, birds, bats and evil bouncing Spots. </p>\n<p>Spot cannot come into physical contact with baddies as that is bad for spot and will knock a heart off Spot's life bar. Spot can either jump with A or pick up/throw blocks with B. Throughout levels Spot collects 7UP Spots as well as hearts. Spots add to the Spot count. Hearts add to Spot's life bar. Both Spots and Hearts add to the overall score. If a block on a platform is just barely preventing Spot from jumping high enough to get on it, Spot can pick the block up in mid jump.</p>\n<p>The game features two difficulties.</p>\n<p><em>Spot: The Cool Adventure</em> was reskinned with a McDonald's theme for the European market.</p>",

To win the game, all alleys have to be beaten in a row with an increasing points requirement (200 to 250) - if the score is missed once, it is back to the beginning.</p>\n<p>The player can set the weight of the bowling ball: a heavier ball has more power but this goes in turn with a loss of control. It also depends on the chosen player character: the male is better with heavy balls while the female character should use a lighter one. The throw itself is divided into three parts: character position on the alley, control and power. While the first is simply chosen by lining the character up, the latter two are reaction games: a marker goes from left to right (and vice versa) and the player has to hit the button when the marker reaches the desired point. A high value (i.e. the marker is right) in control means that the throw is straight while a high power determines the speed and strength.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dead Heat Scramble</em> is a relatively simple racing game. The player chooses between three cars (dune buggy, sand rail or off-road truck) and races against the clock while dodging obstacles like other cars or blockades. The ten courses, which have to be unlocked in a linear order, take place in a tube and are shown in a cross-sectional view from above. The cars can move left and right on the bend. Other than that there are also a few power-ups to collect on the way which bring advantages like a nitro boost.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Blodia</em> is a puzzle game with similarities to sliding block puzzles. Each level is composed of a number of tiles and every one has a part of a pipe (straight or angular) on it - except one which is just a black hole. In one tile a red ball starts rolling and all tiles it rolls through become blank. </p>\n<p>The goal of each level is to let the ball roll through all pipe parts without meeting the hole or a blank tile. \nTo ensure this, the player can move the parts while using the hole as buffer. So, as example, if the player clicks on a tile which is a few tiles away from the hole, all tiles between the clicked tile and the hole are moved by one towards the hole. Then the hole is at the place where the player clicked on. At the start of a puzzle, rolling out of the level boundaries is also deadly, but after a certain amount of tiles are cleared the ball comes out at the opposite side of the playfield.</p>\n<p>The game features all levels of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/54156/diablo/\">TurboGrafx-16 version</a> plus additional ones.</p>",

The main difference is that the game features two playing modes with 80 levels each: one is puzzle oriented while the other features more enemies. The levels themselves are a mix between the levels featured in the PC-88 and NES versions.</p>\n<p>The game itself is a puzzle game in which the player controls a mole who has to push a blue stone on an specially marked place. The stone can only be pushed, but not pulled. While Flappy does not care about gravity, the blue and red stones do: they fall down if pushed off an edge. This has to be used to clear a path for the blue stone and to crush enemies which try to hurt Flappy. Touching them or being crushed by a stone results in the loss of a life.</p>",

Popeye finds himself in a maze (everything except the characters are shown from a top-down view) and needs to find both his girlfriend Olive and a heart within a time limit. After both are found, his adopted baby Swee'Pea appears which needs to be touched to end the level. This is made more difficult by Bluto who may relocate the heart, sets out deadly enemies and generally looks for a fight with Popeye. This costs both time and, if she was already collected, Olive needs to be found again. Wimpy puts out hamburgers which block the path. However, if Popeye collects a randomly appearing spinach can, he can kill enemies and destroy the hamburgers for a limited amount of time. The game features three courses with five levels each.</p>",

Between them are obstacles which obfuscate the shots and, depending on the level, may move horizontally or vertically. When the latter is the case, a collision should be avoided. Every successful shot lowers the energy bar of the opponent and when it runs out (or all of them in case of multiple enemies), a life is lost. After one of of the sides has lost three lives, the match is over.</p>",

This has to be triggered manually by pressing a button, but if there is another flipped tile on the field, all other tiles between the player's position and the other tile will flip, too. Some grids are filled with stationary blocks, moveable blocks (either pushing them normally or send them flying with a strong kick) and holes.</p>\n<p>There are also monsters which need to be avoided. All five of them have different behaviour patterns and have the ability to reverse already flipped tiles; some of them can even push blocks or destroy tiles. The monsters can be killed by using blocks against them: pushing them over the borders of the playfield or a hole will kill them. Alternatively they also can be trapped. Killed monsters slowly respawn at pre-defined spawn points; this takes place over several phases. In the \"egg\" phase, it can be picked up to kill another enemy with it. Another possible weapon are stunned enemies which stood on a multi-flipped row.</p>\n<p>When pushing blocks into a corner, they will disappear and transform into power ups, e.g. bonus points, extra time or a temporary stun of all enemies. A life is lost when an enemy is touched or the time runs out. When that happens, all flipped tiles stay flipped.</p>",

But before this can happen, a series of obstacles have to be cleared, e.g. wandering robots, platforming challenges or small puzzles (when not destroyable blocks are placed directly above destroyable ones, they fall down when their support is gone). Besides walking and jumping, the robot also has a gun to his disposal. The angle can be changed and by holding the fire button longer, the flying distance of the shot can be set. Each level has a time limit and sometimes there is a boss to defeat. Additionally there is a duel mode, also in levels shown from the side, in which two opponents (the second either controlled by a human or the AI) try to kill each other.</p>",

The goal is to hit all ship parts first. There are a few extra weapons available which allow to scout enemy grids or hit multiple grids at once.</p>\n<p>The main difference to the predecessor is that players have to choose their equipment before the match starts: three ships (out of seven) and which/how many extra weapons. \nThere is also a time limit in place which restricts the time to choose the next move.</p>",

The normal mode is a faithful recreation of the original: the playing field consists of a square race track with four lanes. Between the corners the lanes are partly interrupted so the lane can be changed. This is needed because on the uninterrupted parts there are dots which all have to be picked up to progress to the next level. There is also another (on higher levels two) car on the track which tries to crash into the player - of course this needs to be avoided. This mode features ten difficulty levels.</p>\n<p>The special mode adds a few things to the basic playing principle. In this mode there are three difficulty levels and nine tracks which all add variations to the playing field, e.g. a different lane layout, oil slicks which cause the car to spin when driving over it or conveyor belts. There are also a few power ups which randomly appear on the track and need to be picked up within a limited time frame. Most of them are not activated instantly and can be used at a opportune time. The power ups are a bomb (causes a near enemy to spin), a level skip, an extra live, a shield, an enemy slow down and one which causes all cars to make a u-turn. This mode can be played by two human players.</p>",

The player, taking control over the alligator Charly, has the task to defeat the dragon warlord Basso Gila. To do so, five areas (with three or four levels each) have to be conquered. Those levels can be tackled in any order and - for the first three areas - are either land, air, cave or underwater levels. </p>\n<p>Of course there are also a number of enemies which try to harm Charly: every contact with them or environmental obstacles makes a heart from the health bar disappear. Charly can defeat himself by hitting enemies with his tail (the range depending on the power meter). The goal of each level is not only to reach the exit and defeat the occasional boss, but also to open all treasure chests on the way.  Those contain random power ups, e.g. health refreshments, bonus points, power or a bomb which kills everything on screen. The last chest in a level contains the key which is needed to open the exit.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Skate or Die: Tour de Thrash</em> is a skateboard game with two playing modes. The first, \"Retro Rocket Ramp\" is almost identical to the ramp mode of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/12457/skate-or-die-2-the-search-for-double-trouble/\">Skate or Die 2: The Search for Double Trouble</a>. The player is presented with a half-pipe shown from the side and skates on it. If one of the two sides is reached, stunts can be performed by pressing buttons. Which ones are performed depends on the speed and how long the buttons are pressed - the more dangerous, the more points they award. The goal is to gather as many points as possible in a limited amount of time.</p>\n<p>The second mode is called \"Stale Fish Tour\" which takes the player through championships all over the world. Here the skater is shown from behind and races inside a sustained half-pipe. The player can accelerate, brake, move left and right, jump and duck. The goal is to reach the end of the course within three minutes. There are various obstacles which need to be dodged, e.g. concrete walls - bumping into them (or skating over the borders of the half-pipe) means the loss of valuable time. Sometimes there is an AI skater to deal with. This mode can also be played against another human player.</p>",

He is equipped with a ray gun and a jetpack. The jetpack allows him to reach great heights, but burns fuel rapidly - firing it only in short bursts is advised to cross larger gaps; it recharges when landing on solid ground. Enemies can be dispatched by jumping on top of them or firing the ray gun at them, even though it fires in a rather ridiculous arc. Killing opponents gives points, which can be spent to change the standard gun to more advanced models featuring rapid fire, laser blasts, bouncing bullets, and more. Lost health points can be recharged by finding heart icons or by spending points.</p>\n<p>In some parts of the game, Daffy steps on a flying sled and must evade Marvin, always close on his tail.\nThe game also features several boss battles against Marvin, his dog K-9 and other spacey creatures.</p>",

Roger has been framed for having murdered the suspected lover of his wife and now, with help of the private detective Eddie Valiant, he has to prove his innocence.</p>\n<p>This is an action game with puzzle solving elements. Roger Rabbit can move freely within Toontown (and some of its buildings) and the main gameplay consists of talking to people who give Roger clues about where to go next. He also has to collect and use a variety of items in order to progress. However, when walking around town he is attacked by enemies who reduce Roger's life bar if they hit him; there are also a few boss battles. A few (sparse) items can be used to dispatch enemies.</p>",

The hero Wilbur Finletter has to travel through eleven side-scrolling levels in order to stop the evil Doctor Gangrene who runs over the town with his killer tomatoes.</p>\n<p>Basically Finletter moves through the levels, jumps over gaps and avoids the enemies because they have the ability to drain his life energy by touch. Losing enough energy causes the loss of a life. However, he is not defenceless as he can use a kick against the tomatoes. Additionally he can find swords in the levels which can be thrown. Other things to find are lightning bolts (invulnerability for a short time), parachutes and general point suppliers. Finletter also has the ability to use a skateboard. The goal of each level is to find the hidden tomato can and the level end within the time limit. In three instances, there is also a boss fight.</p>",

Every fighter differs from the others with two special attacks which are triggered by pressing the right button combination and a few statistics like speed or defense.

The main playing field consists of said symbols, but randomly switched around. The player controls a frame which encloses four of the symbols. When pressing a button, the symbols are rotated clockwise around the frame. Of course the levels have to be solved within a time limit.</p>\n<p>In the higher difficulty levels, the player also has to deal with so-called special effects which occasionally kick in during play, e.g. some symbols get hidden by \"?\" blocks, symbols rotate on their own or the controls are reversed. Three power-ups can be earned by completing bonus levels or finishing a level really fast: clock (stops time for 20 seconds), flash (skips the current level) and credit (gives a second try after time has run out). Clock and flash have to be activated manually; credits is applied automatically. Besides the regular playing mode, there is also the \"Brain Race\" available which involves solving a certain number of levels (depending on the difficulty) as fast as possible.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Casper</em> is a mini games collection based on the 1995 movie of the same name. Casper is a ghost with three evil uncles, who have turned the dad of Casper's human friend Kat into ectoplasm. The goal is to bring him back to the living. There are six different mini games:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Protect the Ooze: The player has to protect the Ooze containers stationed at the bottom of the screen. Casper's uncles come flying from the top of the screen and have to be shot with the crosshair before they can damage the containers. The game ends after a certain amount of time has passed.</li>\n<li>Ooze Runner: There are four floors which can be reached by climbing ladders. On each floor is an Ooze container which needs to be collected. However, the uncles patrol the floors and their touch needs to be avoided. After enough Ooze has been collected, a flag appears on the top level which needs to be touched to end the level. This has to be accomplished within a time limit.</li>\n<li>Return the Books: One of the uncles drops books from the top of the screen and the goal is to prevent them from falling on the floor. Casper can transform into a trampoline which is used to bounce the book to a collecting container on the left of the screen. Occasionally Ooze vials will appear which need to be collected in order to win the mini game.</li>\n<li>Puzzles: Here the player has to construct a machine, e.g. one which automatically cooks breakfast, by switching a few items into the correct order.</li>\n<li>The Up and At 'Em Machine: Casper has to push Kat, who is sitting in a mining cart, left and right in order to avoid chains and ghosts.</li>\n<li>Casper Says: A simple <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Simon+Says\">Simon Says</a> variant.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order to complete the game, the first four mini games have to completed three times with increasing difficulty, after which the fifth and sixth come into play. After completing those two, the player will face the last challenge: a final Ooze Runner game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>NBA All-Star Challenge 2</em> is a basketball game with six mini games, mostly based on real-life one-on-one variants. The main differences to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/72541/nba-all-star-challenge/\">predecessor</a> are the new mini game Slam Dunk (replaces H.O.R.S.E.) and slightly reworked graphics for the others. Before each game, the player can choose between 27 real-life athletes, one from each NBA team's 1991 roster. All games can be played by two players via the Game Boy link cable.</p>\n<p>The disciplines are:* One On One: A standard one-on-one match which is restricted to the area directly before the basket. The winning condition can be set before starting the match: either scoring a certain amount of points or scoring the most within a certain time frame.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Free Throws: This mini game is about a free throw, i.e. trying to score from a fixed place without getting disturbed by an opponent. A cursor automatically moves around the basket and when the player presses the button, the athlete throws the ball to the cursor's position. The number of throws can be set before the game.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Three Point Shootout: There are five marked points around the basket; directly at the border where scoring rewards three points. The athlete stands at each point for a certain amount of time before he switches to the next point. A throwing attempt is simply performed by pressing the button twice: first for jumping and the second time for throwing the ball. This mini game is available in a training and a competitive variant.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Slam Dunk: Before each round, the player selects the performed dunk variant from a list. This mode is shown from the side, the player moves towards the basket and has to press the right button with the correct timing to score. This mode is available in a training (the game gives a few pointers for the timing) and a competitive mode.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Accuracy Shootout: Works similar to Three Point Shootout with the difference that the points are spread all over the area. The player needs to walk to the spot and, if the previous shot was missed, collect the ball from the place it bounced to. The player can either set the points manually before the mini game starts or use the random generator.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tournament: A series of one-on-one matches in knock-out mode.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

As the title suggests, the game is set in one of Baby Bruno's nightmares. An evil magician kidnaps Bruno's beloved teddy bear Honk and now Bruno has to cross 128 levels (divided into forest, castle and prison worlds) in order to get Honk back. To beat those isometric levels, Bruno needs to meet conditions like solving puzzles (mostly by pushing things around) or collecting items. There are also various platforming challenges to solve and harmful enemies to avoid. Additionally each level runs on a timer - each second left on the clock when finishing a level rewards bonus points and eventually an extra life.</p>",

After beating a level, points are awarded for all accomplishments (time left, passed cars, etc.) which can be invested into car upgrades (speed, handling or attack power against bosses) or turbo boosts which can be activated at any time.

        "description": "<p>In <em>LUCLE</em>, the player controls a space ship which is stranded on a foreign planet. In order to leave it, it needs to find one energy field per level. The biggest problem is how the ship is built: two round cockpits connected with a stiff rod. One of the cockpits is always fixed while the other one can be rotated around it. By alternating between the two cockpits the ship moves around the level, but of course this makes it harder to navigate tight passages. There are useful power-ups to collect like a compass and obstacles which should not be touched. Each level has to be solved within a time limit and there is no restricted number of lives.</p>",

Other examples are one missing center paddle on the Kick-Off and Jackpot tables.</p>",

In each stage, the goal is to reach the exit within the time limit and, in the platforming levels, to defeat a boss.

Mickey and his friends go for a walk and find a mysterious castle. As it turns out, it belongs to an evil witch who kidnaps everyone but Mickey. So of course his goal is to travel through the castle and rescue the other Disney characters.</p>\n<p>The overall 40 levels are a mix between regular platforming (jumping over platforms and avoiding enemies) and puzzle solving, e.g. using a switch to open up a way. The only way to rescue Mickey's friends is to find all hidden portrait pieces which, at the same time, is the winning condition for each level. In addition, there is a boss to defeat after all ten levels. This also upgrades Mickey's magic wand with new abilities, e.g. making water to ice, which are needed for puzzle solving. Other collectibles which can be found in the levels are crystals which may reward items when the wand is used on them, e.g. energy bar refreshments, keys (required for progress) or apples (the only weapon in the game). The levels scroll in all directions.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This entry in the game series based on the <em>Spy vs Spy</em> comic strip series has a similar gameplay premise as the other games of the series, but a different set of levels (overall 20) and scenarios (tropical, lava, ice, cave and pyramid). Another apparent difference is the missing split-screen which normally shows the locations of both spies. The player either takes control of the black or white spy who both have the same goal: finding the five hidden items and reach the exit within the time limit. Additionally a briefcase has to be found in order to hold more than one object at once. Those items are randomly divided over the levels.</p>\n<p>The main challenge of the game is to deal with the other spy, mostly by laying out traps. They are either fake chests or special areas in the level, e.g. a cloud can be prepared to hit a spy with a lightning - but they don't differentiate between the agents. A trap can be triggered without taking damage when quick enough. Each spy has a health bar which is lowered by traps, fist fights against the other spy or walking into a level obstacle. Losing energy lowers the speed and ability to jump and eventually leads to death. The spy will re-spawn after a few seconds but loses all collected items.</p>",

In turn, the mini games \"Le Food Fight\" and \"Inside Outwords\" were removed. </p>\n<p>The game is a mini games collection based on the Disney movie of the same name. The mini games are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chiseler: A <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Breakout\">Breakout</a> variant</li>\n<li>Djali Bowling: A bowling variant with a \"two-click\" system: the position of the bowling goat and the speed by clicking the button with the correct timing while the goat respectively an arrow automatically move back and forth - the position when the button is pressed determines the result. The player also has to choose if the throw is straight or with a drift.</li>\n<li>Catch the Fool: The player is in charge of a rescue net and can move left and right. People are thrown out of the window and the player has to move into position in order to rescue them.</li>\n<li>Upsy Daisy: Two participants are floating because they have a bundle of balloons in their hands. The goal is to destroy all of the opponent's balloons.</li>\n<li>Picture Puzzle: A standard sliding block puzzle.</li>\n<li>Wheel of Fortune: This game has to be unlocked with good results in the other mini games. The game randomly chooses one of the games and assigns a certain mission to it, e.g. beating a certain level in Chiseler with only one ball.</li>\n</ul>",

The player takes the role of Taz who has to free his family which was kidnapped by the two hunters Bull Gator and Axl. This is basically a standard platformer in which the player crosses the 16 levels, jumps over gaps and dodges enemies. However, the unique feature of the cartoon Taz was converted to the game: his ability to spin. This allows him to reach high acceleration and being invulnerable - but every second takes away a part of the associated energy bar. It can be refilled by picking up one of the power ups on the way. Every level has to be solved within a time limit and Taz loses one of four hearts when hit by an enemy or touching water.</p>",

Besides the obvious differences because of technical limitations of the platform, e.g. the bubbles have to differentiated from of their shades instead of colour, it also has less playing modes. Only the arcade mode (a port of the original arcade version with the main singleplayer campaign or the possibility to challenge an AI opponent) and the challenge mode (beating a series of 25 levels as fast as possible) are available. </p>\n<p>Regarding gameplay, this is a tile matching game. There are bubbles of varying shades at the top of the screen and the player controls a stationary cannon at the bottom of the screen. The cannon is loaded with one bubble at the time and the direction of the shot can be varied left and right. The goal is to clear the screen by matching bubbles of the same colour.</p>",

However, during the first four levels Archer is completely defenseless and has to dodge the enemies. The last level introduces two new gameplay mechanics: a bow which stuns enemies and simple switch puzzles. The levels are side-scrolling, but there are junctions.</p>",

Pretty much all living things drain the protagonist's life bar when touched, e.g. pupils or birds, and need to be avoided. Most levels are played from an angled top-down perspective. In those sections the player regularly needs to fetch items for other characters to proceed, e.g. tennis balls. Beavis &amp; Butt-Head have no standard attack and have to collect their weapons (tomatoes and spitballs) in the levels. There are also other power ups to find, e.g. energy refreshments, extra lives or temporary invincibility. The second kind of level consists of standard side-scrolling platforming.</p>",

Different kinds of units have varying attributes like attack strength or range. At the start of a battle, both opponents place their units on their own half of the battlefield. Then, in each turn, they have a certain amount of moves available which can be used to move the units, scout ahead or attack. The position of enemy units is unknown until an own unit is in range and uses its radar. The goal is to completely destroy the enemy fleet. The single-player consists of playing through all eleven maps in order.</p>",

The player takes the role of a sumo wrestler who has to cross five levels (each with three stages plus a boss) to rescue his kidnapped girlfriend. The protagonist has two means of attack: his fists and a stomp attack which, in addition to the damage, can stun enemies. Experience points are awarded for killing enemies, solving hidden mini games and collecting power-ups like health refreshments or temporary invincibility. Eventually this leads to a level up and the player can choose to upgrade one of the two attacks or increase his maximum health. The mini games are sumo wrestling, arm wrestling and thumb wrestling. All are reaction tests in which a button has to be pressed to stop a cursor moving left and right at the correct spot.</p>",

Here the player has to push blocks into certain marked positions, but they cant be pulled.

However, despite the name this is more an action game than a simulation. So the player flies through the area and uses the weapon systems - cannons, missiles and ECM (electronic countermeasure to deflect enemy missiles) - to kill opposing forces. The game is played from a first-person view and the cockpit offers information like a radar and the fuel, which has to refilled when running out. This is handled in-flight. The missions, which begin with a starting and end with a landing sequence, are stringed together without plot.</p>",

Unfortunately she is located in the penthouse of a hotel and Maxie is in the cellar. The goal is to reach said penthouse by solving a number of levels by finding the exit. Those levels are side-scrolling in nature, but there is also some vertical movement involved. Regarding gameplay, there are no specialities: the player jumps over platforms and dodges traps and enemies in order to avoid losing life energy. Getting hit too often results in losing a life. The only way to destroy enemies is to hit them with Maxie's tail and power ups grant either an extra life, a tail upgrade (range) or bonus points.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Cave Noire</em> is a roguelike. The game evolves around four quests (killing monsters, freeing fairies or collecting gold/orbs) with ten difficulties each. The difficulty determines how big the target number is, the stats the player starts with and what monsters are encountered. Starting a quest creates a randomly generated dungeon where the player has one chance to reach the goal - death means a new dungeon has to be created. Beating a difficultly level unlocks the next; this is also the one thing the game saves.</p>\n<p>The dungeons itself are shown from a top-down perspective and feature the hero, walls, floor tiles, monsters and items to collect. Movement is turn-based and each turn is divided into four phases (player movement, player attack, monster attack and finally monster movement). Attacks are only possible when the two participants stand besides each other and the computer simply calculates the result from the statistics (attack, defense, luck and a a random component) which then lowers the health points of the attacked hero/monster. Of course reaching a health of zero means defeat. The mentioned statistics can be improved by finding and using certain items like weapons or armor. Potions, spells and rings which have additional effects when used/equipped, e.g. health refreshments, healing poison, dealing much damage or invisibility.</p>\n<p>Important to note is that the environment also plays an important part in the quest. The walls and tiles may have special effects when touched, examples are pits (the player/monster falls to the next level of the dungeon and takes damage), breakable walls, lava or teleporters. Some rooms may be covered in fog which obscure the floor tiles until the hero walks onto it (monsters still can be made out). There is a specific kind of monster which clears the whole room when killed - but at the same time another one has the exact opposite effect.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>The Flintstones: King Rock Treasure Island</em>, Fred Flintstone finds a treasure map during work. In order to find said treasure, he needs to solve seven levels, some ending with a boss battle. These are traditional side-scrolling platform levels in which Fred has to jump over gaps and dodge enemies. His weapon of choice are axes which he throws at an angle. </p>\n<p>However, hitting an enemy does not kill them instantly but stuns them; a state where they can be abused as stepping stone. Hitting them while they are stunned kills them, but they respawn when Fred walks back to their starting location or at special skulls - those are mostly placed at sections where Fred can't progress without an artificial staircase. Of course there are also power ups to collect: most of them only increase the points counter or refresh the life energy, but one allows Fred to ride his pet dinosaur Dino. This allows him to throw axes straight and jump higher, but Dino is lost when hit once.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Uch\u016b Senkan Yamato</em> on the Game Boy is an adaptation of the anime series of the same name, also known as <em>Space Battleship Yamato</em> and <em>Star Blazers</em>. It adapts the story of the original 1974 television series: in 2199, the Earth lies under siege by aliens from Gamila. The surface of the planet has become uninhabitable through bombardment by radioactive meteorites, so the surviving humans live underground. Hope arrives with a message from the planet Iscandar. If humans can somehow travel to Iscandar, they might acquire a device that can cleanse the planet of the radioactive damage. So from the husk of the Japanese WWII battleship <em>Yamato</em>, a powerful new spaceship is built that can fight through the Gamilan blockade and reach Iscandar. Time is of the essence, though: within a year, the built-up radiation will have killed everyone on Earth.</p>\n<p>The game presents the adventures of the Yamato and her crew as a series of turn-based battles, each based on encounters from the series. On a top-down view of the two-dimensional battlefield, icons represent the Yamato, her escort of Black Tiger fighter squadrons, and Gamilan fighters and capital ships. Moving one's own units next to an enemy squadron begins a battle. Battles not involving the Yamato are fought automatically. It is important to keep the losses to the Black Tiger squadrons to a minimum because there is no chance to resupply and only the survivors are taken to the next level.</p>\n<p>When the Yamato herself takes part in an engagement, the battles are fought via an action sequence. In these the player either controls the Cosmo Zero fighter flown by Susumu Kodai (when under attack by a fighter squadron) or the Yamato's main guns (when engaged with capital ships). From a first-person perspective, enemy ships can be shot at or evaded. It is important to pay attention to the Yamato's damage indicator, but also to the load level of her wave motion gun. This powerful gun can destroy even big fleets with one shot, but only if they are aligned with the gun's firing zone at the moment of discharge, as indicated by the radar screen.</p>\n<p>The goal in each level is usually to get the Yamato to a certain point on the map, representing an obstacle like a Gamilan base or a natural hazard. Once reached, the level is won by completing a button-mashing exercise within a time limit. A password to the next level is awarded afterwards. Another action sequence follows when the Yamato must warp to another system: a bouncing ball moves over a display of the warp systems and must be stopped by a button press at the right point. There are a few tries to get it right, but too many failures mean game over.</p>\n<p>Besides the Yamato being destroyed, there is also another way to lose. Each game turn represents a day being removed from the one-year time limit. If Iscandar isn't reached in time, the mission is a failure.</p>",

In each, Batman has to face obstacles like traps, conveyor belts, moving platforms and many henchmen. He can use his fists to punch enemies as well as batarangs (with limited ammunition) to knock them out from afar. Batman's grappling hook connects to ceilings and is used to pull him across chasms or up platforms. He can also utilize a wall jump to get higher in narrow spaces. Power-ups to collect are health upgrades and batarang ammunition. At the end of each level, a boss fight awaits. Some of the bosses are immune to the batarangs, but all have a certain weakness.</p>",

Queen Iris's sister, Sorx went missing a year ago, along with the evil mage Thailand Rossum (nicknamed Taros in fan-translation). The Queen has called upon adventurers to defeat Thailand Rossum and find her sister. Your party of adventurers has heeded this call.</p>\n<p><em>Wizardry Gaiden</em> is a side story Wizardry game for Gameboy. It is an original, Japanese-only title, and is not a port of any computer versions. Its developer, ASCII, was also the developer that created the Wizardry 1 through 6 remakes for Famicom and Super Famicom, and as such <em>Wizardry Gaiden</em> retains much of the same look and feel of other console titles in the series. The gameplay system most closely resembles <em>Wizardry V</em> (released the following year for Super Famicom), with the addition of long-range weapons, enhanced spells, and auto-mapping.</p>\n<p>The player creates characters from the stock Wizardry classes and races seen in other games in the series, such as fighters and wizards, and then forms a party of up to 6 to explore the solitary dungeon. The player transverses the six floor dungeon in 1st person, fighting random encounters and gaining experience to level up. Thanks to the introduction of auto-mapping, it is possible to complete <em>Wizardry Gaiden</em> without the use of graph paper, unlike other early entries in the Wizardry series.</p>",

There are two rivals in every scenario, \"black\" and \"white\" - and four sides are in game: US, USSR, FRG and Japan, each with specific units, based on realistic warfare, for example Mig-23, Su-24, T-80. Bradley, F-15, F-16.... Like in other Daisenryaku games, each side has to produce units such as infantry, several types of tanks, helicopters, etc. Different units have different strengths and weaknesses. The outcome of combat is determined by the attack strength which varies between different unit types. Game has 6 maps, can be played both against the console or against another human player.</p>",

This time, however, the player can take along a number of items for a quick boost when they're in big trouble. The player can also level up, perform magic, and fly to certain points on the map.

The odd-numbered stages are horizontal scrolling stages and the even-numbered stages are a simple \"platform\" stages. Each stage ends in a boss fight. Zeoth can fly with a jetpack (but the player must tap a button to resist gravity) and can fire in four directions (right, left, down and up). The basic weapons can be improved. The mech can take some damage before being destroyed and has just one life, however, there are unlimited continues.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Wizardry Gaiden II</em> is the second in the Japan-exclusive Wizardry Gaiden series. The scenario was written by the Japanese author <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/749184/benny-matsuyama/\">Benny Matsuyama</a>, and is not based on any Wizardry game developed by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Sir-tech+Software,+Inc\">Sir-tech</a>. Developed by ASCII, the same company that created console versions of other Wizardry games, Wizardry Gaiden II shares many similarities to other console entries in the series in style.</p>\n<p>The game takes place in the city of Al-Marl, an oasis haven in the eastern desert. Workers in the city have been working tirelessly to uncover the mystery of nearby ruins, but to no avail. Near-daily cave-ins have killed or stranded many, and the labyrinth's mysteries only seem to deepen. It isn't until a warning carved into a metal plate is discovered that the people of Al-Marl realize the great evil they have awoken: their city was built upon the grave of the ancient sorcerer-emperor Halgith. </p>\n<p>Many who had lost their lives exploring the cave rose from the dead, the the city hung in darkness. Not even the Chamberlin Udin was spared, his own daughter seemingly overpowered by the darkness that has enveloped the city. His own soldiers refused to enter the labyrinth, and the situation grew dire. It was when things grew the darkest that Udin began to look to adventurers, passing through the oasis on their way to the other side of the desert, for help.</p>\n<p>You are one such party of adventurers. You create a party of up to six characters to explore the maze in first person. Turn-based random encounters provide you with experience points and gold, which can be used to increase the power of characters and purchase better equipment. While the enemies are difficult, the most difficult foe is the maze itself, which is filled with fake walls, pits, hidden doors, and sudden teleporters designed to disorient you. Becoming lost in the labyrinth can be certain death, as the only way to replenish magic and gain levels is to return to the town on the first floor of the dungeon. An auto-mapping feature (which can be disabled) can be used on all but the lowest floor of the dungeon.</p>\n<p>The dungeon contains eleven floors, though floors are 16x16 (compared to the 20x20 of other console Wizardry games). The gameplay features, such as spells, classes, and races, remain unchanged from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/59795/wizardry-the-first-episode-suffering-of-the-queen/\">first</a> Wizardry Gaiden title. The closest gameplay comparison to the main Wizardry series would be <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3983/wizardry-v-heart-of-the-maelstrom/\">Wizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom</a>, since many of the gameplay changes from that title are included.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In this boxing game, you control Muhammad Ali where you have to fight a series of opponents in an attempt to become the heavyweight champion of the world.</p>\n<p>The game has two modes, Single Fight and World Title Trial.  Single Fight is the standard exhibition mode where you select from any of the 31 boxers available as your opponent and select the maximum number of rounds to fight between three and eight.</p>\n<p>World Title Trial is your career mode where you have to defeat boxers to earn money and move up the rankings.  You begin at rank 29 and can select from the three boxers ranked below you for your first fight.  You fight for a purse and winning the fight earns you that purse which you can then use to negotiate a fight against a higher ranked boxer.  This mode also gives you the option of selecting the number of rounds per fight, again between three and eight.</p>\n<p>If you choose to have training turned on you can select the training method for Ali in the allocated number of weeks before his next fight.  You have four attributes \u2013 power, speed, accuracy and stamina.  You have five training regimes to choose from \u2013 small punch bag, skipping rope, heavy punch bag, weight training and road work training.  You also have a sparring option which allows you to choose your combo punches for your fight.</p>\n<p>In the fight itself, the boxers compete in two-minute rounds.  The boxers have a power meter which goes down as they get fatigued.  You can punch with either the A or B button and punches deplete the health meter which is an interactive silhouette boxer.  The health meter is black at full health and turns white with each punch landed, you will need to land a series of punches to weaken your opponent as the meter rises again with rest.  If the meter is fully white you can finish off your opponent with a combo as the word flashes on the screen.  Successfully initiating your combo knocks the opponent down in which if he does not answer to the referee\u2019s ten count then the fight is over.  The fight can also be won by a TKO (3 knock downs in a single round) or a points decision where instead of the standard 10 points per round system, the game uses a point system where a point is scored for every punch landed during the round as well as 25 points for a knock down and the one with the most points wins the fight. </p>\n<p>At the end of a training session the game gives you a password containing 16 characters of letters, numbers and symbols which you use to continue your game by selecting Continue Old Game in the main menu.</p>",

It is loosely based on the 1991 Formula One season.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is very similar to the Game Boy's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5375/f-1-race/\">F-1 Race</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Michael+Andrettis+World+GP\">Nakajima Satoru F-1 Hero</a>, however the degree of difficulty is higher. The track map is not displayed on the screen, which means the player has to basically memorize each turn in order to not get off the track or collide with the advertising signs.</p>\n<p>In the first play-through, the grand prix mode has sixteen rounds divided into eight different levels. In each of these levels there's a main rival to beat. A password will be displayed when the player finish successfully each level, while the game over screen appears if the number of points obtained is lower than those obtained by the rival. In the first play-through all these rivals (except the first one) will not compete since the very beginning of the championship. One example is Satoru Nakajima which will only appear in the last round.</p>\n<p>However if the player use a specific level password, the championship will start all over again with all the competitors and difficulty (in terms of the qualifying time) of that level. Briefly, to play a real competitive championship, the player will have to finish Round 15 first to access the last password.</p>\n<p>Before every race, there's the setting option where the player can customize the machine by adjusting six parts: tires, wings, brake, mission, suspension, and steer. While racing, four parts can be damaged. \"Pit in\" will fix these \"trouble parts\".</p>\n<p>To enter the race and compete against five other drivers, a minimum time in the qualifying session (which consists of two laps) must be obtained. At certain point during the first play-through, with advancing levels, the difficulty will increase, meaning that the player has to make an almost \"immaculate\" lap in order to obtain a good time and therefore be qualified.</p>\n<p>Other modes presented in the game include: warming up, multi game, and music test.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>F1 Pole Position</em> is a Formula One racing video game released for the Game Boy by Ubisoft. The game is originally known in Japan as <em>Nakajima Satoru Kansh\u016b F-1 Hero GB '92: The Graded Driver</em> which is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/62934/nakajima-satoru-kanshu-f-1-hero-gb/\">Nakajima Satoru Kansh\u016b F-1 Hero GB</a>.</p>\n<p>In comparison to its predecessor, the game has a more realistic approach due to the licensing by Foca to Fuji Television. Modes available are the usual: grand prix, warming up (or training), multi game (or multi player), and options.</p>\n<p>Some other changes (or improvements if possible) in relation to its predecessor: the more detailed background and tracks. Also, making the turns without getting off the track is much more easier due to a better view (even though the track map is still not displayed on the screen).</p>\n<p>During the qualifying and races, \"retire\" will appear if the player crashes too much, or simply want to stop racing. In the Japanese version, before every race, Satoru Nakajima will give some tips about certain areas of the circuit, while this feature was removed from the Western version. One other difference is that <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/76301/ayrton-senna/\">Ayrton Senna</a> is included in the Japanese version, while <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/49911/michael-andretti/\">Michael Andretti</a> replaces Senna in the Western one.</p>\n<p>In both versions the player has to compete in two full seasons. The rounds are basically split into different parts, in each one a minimum goal must be achieved (to qualify and finish the race x number of times) so that the contract is renewed. If the player fails, the game over screen will pop out.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Nemesis</em> is the first entry in the long-running <em>Gradius</em> series on the Game Boy. Its side-scrolling shoot'em up gameplay follows the series template closely. Players control the Vic Viper through five levels, most based on levels in earlier entries, for a kind of 'greatest hits' of the series. There is a cave level (as in level 1 of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4512/gradius/\">Gradius</a>), the mandatory Moai stage, a Gigeresque organic level, a graveyard (similar to bonus stages in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4512/gradius/\">MSX</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4512/gradius/\">PC Engine</a> version of the original Gradius) and a high-tech base. Besides the classic core ship in the first level, all boss enemies are entirely new.</p>\n<p>The cycling Gradius power-up system is reused here: collected power ups advance the power meter which can be activated at any time to gain the highlighted item. The line-up includes the classic selection of speedups, missiles, dual shots, lasers, option satellites and forcefields.</p>\n<p>The game allows players to start in any of the five levels and even to set the number of lives to a maximum of 99.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Madden Football series makes its debut on the Game Boy with <em>Madden 95</em>. Unlike most games in the series since 1993, this one does not include a NFL license, and thus features generic team names. The included teams, stats and schedules are however based on the 1994 NFL season.</p>\n<p>Standard game modes include exhibition games, full seasons (including playoffs) and playoffs. Special modes include Championship playoffs - featuring 38 legendary champion teams, including Green Bay '66, San Francisco '89 and Pittsburgh '78 - and Franchise playoffs - featuring 12 'all-time' teams. Exhibition mode allows players to select from all regular, champion and franchise teams plus a regular Madden and an all-time Madden team. Game length can be set between 20, 40 and 60 minutes.</p>\n<p>The game features a playbook of more than 80 offensive plays (including fake punts and field goals) and more than 60 defensive plays, all of which can be flipped. The game also features freely definable audibles, substitutions (quarterback and halfback only), timeouts, and game stats.</p>\n<p>Gameplay during a game is seen from the top, with the field scrolling vertically. Players are moved via the D-pad and the Game Boy's two buttons are used for throwing the ball left or right during passing play, spinning or diving during rushing play, selecting the defender closest to the ball or tackling during defensive play, and so on.</p>",

The game is closely based on its immediate <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/66100/madden-95/\">predecessor</a>. Like the earlier game, this one is not licensed from the NFL, and features generic team names, but with teams, stats and schedules based on the 1995 NFL season. Both the new expansion teams Carolina and Jacksonville as well as rule changes like the two-point conversion are incorporated.</p>\n<p>Game modes have been cut down from the predecessor: the only remaining ones are exhibition, season and playoffs. In addition to the 30 regular teams, there is an All-Madden team for use in exhibition games only. Most features from the predecessor make a return: selectable game length (20, 40 or 60 minutes), freely definable audibles, timeouts, and detailed stats. The playbook has been reworked, substitutions are now available for all positions and the game features quarterback speech for the first time.</p>\n<p>Game perspective (top-down, vertically scrolling) and controls are mostly unchanged from the predecessor. When played on a Super Game Boy, the game now allows for two players to match up, for which a special bluffing mode is available.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Madden 97</em> is the last appearance of the series on the original Game Boy. Coming from developer Tiertex, it is based closely on their <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/66186/madden-96/\">Madden 96 for Game Gear</a>, with similar menus and options, but with platform-appropriate graphics and no digitized speech. Like earlier Game Boy titles in the franchise, <em>Madden 97</em> does not feature an NFL license, so offers only generic team names. Still, teams and stats are based on the 1996 NFL season.</p>\n<p>Game modes include Exhibition, Season, Playoffs and Sudden Death. 30 regular teams plus the traditional All-Madden team are available. Besides the usual features like selectable game length, freely definable audibles, flippable playbook, timeouts and substitutions, previously Game Gear-only features making their first appearance on the Game Boy include variable weather and injuries.</p>",

The tie-in game, however, is nothing but a remake of Pony Canyon's 1984 title <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/67453/fruit-panic/\">Fruit Panic</a></em>.</p>\n<p>A single-screen platformer, you guide a man with a hat from platform to platform. Since he can't jump by himself, you must use the trampolines to the left and right to make him reach the right platform, where he can pick up cactuses, flowers and other plants. When all plants are picked, the next stage follows. What makes the game hard are the \"Tasmanian devils\" which hunt your man. By dropping on a devil from above, or laying a bomb for an enemy to walk into, you can temporarily stun them.</p>",

The goal in each level is to collect a number of magnetic ID cards which open up the level exit. Many different species of dinosaur stand in Grant's way: walking, flying and even the swimming kind. To defend himself, he has access to a gun as well as hand grenades, both with unlimited ammunition. When going for a swim, the gun turns into a harpoon. When he gets hurt, he can heal himself through medkits that can be found lying about. Extra lives are also available.</p>\n<p>Set between the platforming levels are various boss fights against powerful enemies like a Triceratops, Pteranodon, Velociraptor and T-Rex, each of which requires a unique strategy to defeat.</p>\n<p>Further variation from standard platforming comes in two T-Rex pursuit stages. In these, a T-Rex approaches from the left side of the screen which scrolls to the right automatically, allowing for little to no margin of error in choosing the right path. These levels also contain ID cards. These do not have to be collected, but picking them all up results in an extra life being awarded.</p>",

        "description": "<p>One day, the M\u014dri Detective Agency receives a letter from entrepreneur Genji Nobuhara inviting Kogor\u014d M\u014dri to the underground amusement park that he is about to open. The owner is afraid that someone wants him dead and wishes the detective's help in preventing that. Detective M\u014dri, together with his daughter Ran, freeloader Conan and the Junior Detective League (Conan's friends from elementary school) arrive at the scene, most of them with the intention of having fun. However, soon after exchanging greetings with the staff managing the park, the air turns grim as the first murder occurs.</p>\n<p><em>Meitantei Conan: Chika Y\u016benchi Satsujin Jiken</em> is the first game based on the manga <em>Detective Conan</em> by G\u014dsh\u014d Aoyama, serialized in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday since 1994. It is an original story, although the amusement park theme is constantly revisited in the franchise, especially in anime and game form. The protagonist is Conan Edogawa, the alter ego of Shinichi Kud\u014d, a high school detective who was transformed unwillingly into a kid. <em>Chika Y\u016benchi Satsujin Jiken</em> itself is an adventure game where the task is to solve murder cases. The player controls Conan from a top-down perspective and can move around freely in the park, seeking for clues or engaging other characters in conversation. Sometimes it's possible to choose what to ask a character, but that has no outcome on how the case proceeds. The investigation is moved forward by talking to the right people, finding the necessary clues, solving puzzles and by \"thinking\". The latter is an actual gameplay mechanic where Conan analyses certain events that he finds suspicious. It ends with the player selecting one out of two deductions. If the incorrect answer was chosen, the accusation will not hold and the murderer will get away. Furthermore, it's possible to officially accuse a suspect with insufficient proof and without finishing the entire scenario, even if this results in arresting the wrong person or ending the game prematurely.</p>\n<p>The game has three different murder cases, each corresponding to one of the attractions in the amusement park: the roller coaster, the horror house and the huge maze. The first attraction Conan enters after being greeted by Nobuhara and the staff decides which scenario the player will play. In order to switch to another murder case, the game must be started over. The only way to resume a previous session is via passwords the game gives at specific points during the scenario.</p>\n<p>A standard feature adopted by later installments is the presence of mini games. Two of them (a claw crane and a skateboarding game) can be played at any time in the Game Center, while others must be found or unlocked.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Swamp Thing</em> is a platform game based on the DC Comics character. Released in conjunction with an <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10689/swamp-thing/\">NES game of the same name</a>, the Game Boy version has a unique design and set of levels.</p>\n<p>Players control Swamp Thing who must move out into the world to combat Dr. Arcane. Arcane plans to release a serum into the atmosphere that will turn everyone into mutated beings called Un-Men. Besides stopping Arcane, Swamp Thing also has to heal the environmental damage the villain and his henchmen have created.</p>\n<p>The game consists of four levels: at the start of the game, players can choose whether to start in the desert, arctic or forest, all of which have to be completed (in any order) before the final level opens up. In each level, players will confront various wild animals under Arcane's control and can defeat them with a shot attack. Firing a shot actually reduces Swamp Thing's life energy - it is a good idea to catch the shot when it boomerangs back to regain it. Collecting water icons also restores life energy. Besides energy there is also a second meter that slowly drains automatically - it represents the environmental health and can be refilled by helping friendly animals (like turning an upended turtle back up) or recycling trash lying about the levels with a special recycling attack.</p>\n<p>At the end of each level, a powerful boss enemy awaits. Defeating the boss results in Swamp Thing gaining a new power, like invisibility. The powers only work when he stands still, however.</p>",

Compared to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/20476/pga-tour-96/\">other</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/20476/pga-tour-96/\">versions</a>, it offers a different selection of playing modes, licensed golfers and courses, and also has its own style of graphical presentation.</p>\n<p>The game includes five licensed courses: Avenel, Woodlands, Scottsdale, Summerlin and Sawgrass. Available playing modes are Practice, Tournament and a Skins Challenge. Up to two players can play, with any combination of human and AI players possible. Two human players can play taking turns on one Game Boy and it is also possible to watch AI players play by themselves.</p>\n<p>Before a game, players can select from four different club sets. Actual gameplay is different from most contemporary golf games: the current hole to be played is seen from a top-down view. In this view, club and spin options are set and the target location marked by a crosshair. The view then switches to a perspective besides the golfer for the actual swing, which is controlled via the standard three-click method (start, strength, accuracy), visualized by a bar. The flight of the ball is again seen in the top-down view. For putting, the top-down view changes to a close-up of the green and the side-view zooms in on the golfer's feet.</p>",

The game features five different mini-games based on real-life one-on-one playing modes. All can be played by two players via the link cable.</p>\n<p>The modes are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One On One: two players attack the same basket, alternating on offense and defense, playing to either a time or a score limit (both adjustable).</li>\n<li>Free Throws: one player gets either 5, 10 or 20 throws. A crosshair moves over the board automatically and the button has to be pressed at the right position to make the shot.</li>\n<li>Horse: One player has to replicate the other player's shot from the same position or gain a letter in the word H-O-R-S-E. The first player to complete the word loses.</li>\n<li>Accuracy Shootout: Within an adjustable time limit, shots must be made from set positions for maximum score.</li>\n<li>Tournament: a One On One tournament in knock-out mode, featuring eight players total.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For each mode, players can select from 27 different players (one per NBA team of the 1989-1990 season), featuring the likes of Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing, Larry Bird, and Isiah Thomas.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mercenary Force</em> is an unconventional shoot'em up set in Japan's Edo period and inspired by Japanese history and mythology. When Japan is invaded by the minions of a dark lord, the shogun sets out to hire the best warriors in the land to combat the enemy. </p>\n<p>Players start with 5000 yen and must begin by hiring their mercenaries. The team has four slots and can be recruited from five different character types (servant, ninja, monk, samurai and mystic) in any combination (including more than one of any character). The characters differ in hiring price, starting health, weapons (amount of projectiles, speed and direction), and their special attack.</p>\n<p>The game consists of six levels, seen from an angled top-down/side-view perspective, with the screen scrolling automatically to the right. The mercenaries must shoot hordes of enemies to get to the next level, including several bosses. The mercenaries can change their formation between four different options: a vertical line, a diamond shape, a square shape and a horizontal arrowhead formation. It is also possible to switch the character in the lead position, leading to a large variety of tactical options. The hit points of each team member are counted individually, so if one is killed the remaining ones can fight on. Besides their standard weapon, each character also has a special suicide attack, triggered by pressing both buttons at the same time. These are usually highly devastating attacks, but the monk's power actually allows the group to skip ahead through a large part of the level.</p>\n<p>Killed enemies drop coins of 10 yen in value that disappear after a short while if not picked up. The money reserve is used in a matter of ways: between stages, new recruits can be hired to replace fallen fighters. There are also various buildings in the levels that allow the spending of money. Cafes offer various items that restore or increase health and, in some levels, can change the character class of the team leader. There is a fortune-reading at a temple which makes it possible to recruit a hidden character, and the possibility to resurrect fallen comrades at a daibutsu. Only temples don't cost money and offer healing for free.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Jack Nicklaus Golf</em> brings Accolade's golf series to the Game Boy with a selection of courses from the computer versions and most features and options also present.</p>\n<p>Four courses are available: Jack's Greatest, Castle Pines and Desert Mountain as previously seen in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7988/jack-nicklaus-greatest-18-holes-of-major-championship-golf/\">Greatest 18 Holes</a> and Muirfield Village from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1275/jack-nicklaus-unlimited-golf-course-design/\">Unlimited</a>. Gameplay modes are skins (for two to four players) and stroke play (for one to four players). Players can choose their golfer's gender and select from beginner and expert skill levels and different tee modes (professional, men's and women's). Besides playing the complete course, there are also practice options for a single hole, the green, and a driving range.</p>\n<p>Playing a hole begins with a top-down overview of the hole, followed by the standard view from behind the golfer. Strokes are done with the standard three-click method: start, power, and accuracy. During play, it is possible to pull up the hole overview, look at the score card and statistics and change the weather conditions. The game also offers replays and mulligans.</p>",

Chase her captor across four stages containing multiple rooms, smashing blocks and kicking ladders to reach energy pods that reveal an exit to the next room. Enemies in each level take lives when they touch you. There are extra lives and upgrade pods that can be collected to increase speed, destroy dense blocks, jump, and even shoot missiles. </p>\n<p>Every couple of minutes, a large rock monster stomps his way on the scene respawning blocks previously destroyed, so be careful you don't occupy the same space. The stages also feature alternative paths and boss fights. Passwords allow you to resume at the beginning of each stage.</p>",

The player is presented with a picture based on one of the above mentioned games which is scrambled at the start of a game. The player's task is to recreate the original picture by sliding the tiles around one at a time.</p>\n<p>This variant of the concept adds special items that appear on the tiles for brief moments. They are activated when the tiles they are on are moved around. Among these are a bomb which if not moved within ten seconds of its appearance will detonate and lead to a game over. There is also a lock and key combo where the locked tile is unmovable until the tile with the key has been activated. Other items include one that reshuffles some of the tiles, one that gives extra time and one that auto completes the current puzzle.</p>\n<p>There are two different game types: normal game and against the clock. Both are on time but the latter is played without any of the special items. There are also four different difficulty level that can be chosen before a game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Boggle Plus</em> is an adaptation of the word construction game in which players must form words from adjacent letters in a randomly assigned grid within a time limit.</p>\n<p>The game includes Boggle (4x4 grid) and Big Boggle (5x5 grid) variants, along with three additional games based on the same concept. In Anagram, players must unscramble a short sequence of letters to form a meaningful word. In Categories, a 6x6 grid is filled with pre-determined letters and players must find a number of words matching a category like 'musical instruments', 'sports' or 'beauty products'. Use All takes place on a 5x5 grid, with the major challenge being that letters used to form a word are removed from the grid. The goal is to clear the entire grid. The letters can be rescrambled if necessary.</p>\n<p>The game can be played by one or two human players who can be joined by up to four CPU players of varying AI levels. All variants can be played as single games or as tournaments up to a certain score.</p>",

The gameplay is essentially the same as that game and resembles a sliding puzzle game but has a different set of pictures. Unlike traditional sliding puzzles all the pieces are not on the board from the start but are launched by the player from the top left corner of the board. The pieces can then be pushed horizontally or vertically with the goal being to recreate a picture which can be shown at any time by pressing a button. The game is timed and if a puzzle is not completed fast enough, one of three lives will be lost.</p>\n<p>All features from the original game are retained. This include doors that open and close and that can be used to push pieces out of play. They will then be put pack into the queue and be ready to be launched again. There are also various bonus items that can be pushed into each other for bonus points or time increases. Some items have negative effects such as bombs that explode after five seconds (and take a life away). Bombs have to be pushed out through a door or combined with a water tap to be destroyed. At some places there are cracks in the walls. Pushing a piece into a crack causes it to bounce back to its original position.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Sensible Soccer: European Champions</em> is a fast-paced soccer game. The action is shown from a top-down perspective which only shows a part of the playfield. The controls only use one button to initiate a shot: how long the button is pressed determines the strength and the direction pad controls the direction. However, there is also a novice mode available with the usual division between a shoot and pass button. Another important option is the dribbling (novice or expert) which sets how well the ball sticks to the controlled athlete. Before starting a match, there are also some limited tactical options available (choosing the formation and switching the position of athletes around).</p>\n<p>In contrast to the computer versions there are no pre-set tournaments, but the player can start two tournaments with customizable requirements: cup or league. The cup allows to set the number of rounds (one to four) and some rules can be switched on or off for each round individually (number of legs, extra time, penalties). The league on the other hand has the options number of teams (between one and seven), how often the teams face each other (between once and four times) and if a win rewards two or three points. The pitch type (normal, dry, wet, icy, hard or random) can be set in both modes. There are twenty national and twenty club teams (all with slightly changed original names) to choose from. General options are the game length (between three and seven minutes) as well as switching weather on or off.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Roadster</em> lets the player race a sports car over tracks on various terrain. The game offers two different racing modes. In the training mode players can practice by driving solo on any of the sixteen tracks available, with the tracks consisting of five city courses, four country courses, four mountain courses, a dirt course, and two gymkhana courses. The main mode available is the race mode. In this mode players select the amount of races they want to compete in (5, 10, 15, or 20). After that is decided, players choose from one of six different drivers. Each driver comes with their own weight and guts percentage, and have different starting body and tire ratings for their roadster.</p>\n<p>During a race players have to compete against five other drivers trying to get the best placed finish. While in the race, players can make pit stops to repair any tire wear or body damage they sustained while out on the track. Points are earned depending on where the player finished the race. More points are awarded for the better finish.\nThe ultimate champion is the driver who totals the most points after a series of races.</p>\n<p>There is occasionally a power-up that can be picked up during a race. After the race this is collected in, this power-up can be spent on either increasing the statistics of the body or tire rating.</p>\n<p>The game also offers the option if they want to race with the music on or off.</p>",

It is instead a re-skinned version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/24777/nekketsu-koha-kunio-kun-bangai-rantohen/\">Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun: Bangai Rant\u014dhen</a>, with general gameplay and level design kept, but character and background graphics as well as music completely changed to fit the Double Dragon series.</p>\n<p>Once again the Lee brothers are called into action when they are framed for the murder of a man named Wright. Now hunted by the leader of the Scorpions gang, the two must fend off Scorpions members sent after them and find the real murderer to clear their name. In single-player mode, the player controls Billy Lee, while in the simultaneous two-player mode via link cable, the second player controls Jimmy Lee.</p>\n<p>While still a side-scrolling beat'em up game, the game has many differences from other entries in the series due to its origins. There is neither weapons use by the player nor standard jumps. Only kicks and punches are available. Pressing both buttons simultaneously makes the player crouch, which can be used as an evasive tactic or can be followed by a jumping uppercut.</p>\n<p>The action moves through three stages of several sub-stages each. The first two begin in the streets and then move into a subway station and subway train. The third level moves from the streets to a multi-storied building in which the main bad guy resides. Besides standard goons to be taken out, several sub-bosses await, including a boxer, a ninja, a sumo wrestler and a Jason-Vorhees-meets-Leatherface styled masked maniac with a chainsaw.</p>",

The player's character, fitted in one of two Bionic Battlesuits, must search through five Labyrinths of War to destroy the Bionic Battlebots hell-bent on crushing human existence. In each labyrinth, the player must seek and destroy a certain number of Battlebots to make it out alive. But be careful - even though the Battlesuits are equipped with the same abilities as the Battlebots themselves, they can only take so much punishment. Too many hits will mean the destruction of both the Battlesuit and life as we know it. The player, however, can team up with a buddy to save humankind.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mikeneko Holmes no Kishid\u014d</em> is an adventure game based on the 7th Mikeneko Holmes novel by Jir\u014d Akagawa, originally published in 1983. It is a murder mystery taking place in a palace in Germany. The game's namesake is Holmes, a calico cat who helps assist the siblings Yoshitar\u014d and Harumi Katayama in their detective work. The player chooses from a list of commands, such as \"Look\" (while using the game cursor to point at objects), \"Talk\" and \"Go\", with other verbs appearing in the appropriate contexts. The player can also switch between Yoshitar\u014d and Harumi, or generate a password to resume playing later. There is also a \"game description\" option on the main menu which explains the game's premise and controls to new players.</p>",

Since that time, Earth has been uninhabited... until one day, super-intelligent robots from another galaxy descended on the planet and took over. While the robots did manage to solve Earth's pollution problem, they have done something else that may not be just as magnanimous: they have reshaped the Earth in their own image! Now, an ad hoc liberation army sets forth to rid the planet of these mechanical maniacs and make the Earth safe for humans again.</p>\n<p><em>Chiky\u016b Kaih\u014d Gun ZAS</em> is a shoot-em-up game in which a single player must shoot his/her way through 5 integrated stages of mayhem to save the Earth from the robot invasion. (The player can choose to start playing on any one of the first four stages, but can only access the final stage by starting from level 1 and fighting through level by level.) While the player only has a single weapon (which can upgraded) and a shield, he/she is assisted by a pair of guns that can be moved in a straight line from the ship, giving him/her more firepower when combating the enemies. Plus, the player can detect approaching enemies from the background. And the player will need every one of these advantages, because timing is key if the Earth is to be saved!</p>",

        "description": "<p>Ninja Taro is an action RPG set in feudal Japan with gameplay similar to \"The Legend of Zelda\". In Japan, Ninja Taro is known as \"Sengoku Ninja-kun\", and is one of several titles in the Japanese \"Ninja Jajamaru-kun\" series.</p>\n<p>As the eponymous Ninja Taro (or \"Ninja-kun\" in the Japanese release), you are tasked by your teacher, Kashin-Koji, to seek out Lord Nobu (\"Nobunaga Oda\"), who has requested the service of the land's greatest ninja. The path there is dangerous, but upon reaching Lord Nobu at Geko Castle, it is revealed that the evil Lord Shin Takeda (\"Takeda Shingen\") is rumored to have died. You are tasked with investigating the rumors to see if they are true or not.</p>\n<p>Lord Shin's castle is located in Kai Province, not too far from Geko Castle, but the direct path there is blocked by a \"mighty beast\", a creature who is said to be able to withstand all weapons. Upon returning to your teacher for advice, you are tasked with seeking out your teacher's old friend, Kondo, in Iga Province. However, Kondo is nowhere to be found, but instead Kondo's daughter, who you must convince to help you before you're able to continue on your quest...</p>\n<p>Although you begin the game with your Ninja Sword and Throwing Stars, many other items can be found to assist you on your quest. Additional weapons, the Masamune and the Throwing Knives, are not as strong as your primary weapons, but are more agile; medicinal Herbs and Potions may be found that can heal you; and unique tools such as Camouflage and Fire will also be at your disposal, among many others.</p>\n<p>Ninja Taro pulls stylistically from many sources, including Japanese history as well as classical mythology. Besides referencing real historical places and people, such as the real 16th century daimyo, Oda Nobunaga, Ninja Taro references many creatures from Japanese folklore, such as ghosts, tengu, and ogres. Additionally, some elements of the game's design are decidedly more modern, with some monstrous adversaries and locales seemingly out of popular Japanese animation.</p>\n<p>In Ninja Taro, the player character's walking speed is very slow compared to similar games, but most enemies and adversaries are programmed with this in mind. </p>\n<p>Ninja Taro appears to share its game engine with other action RPGs put out by American Sammy, namely: <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/17388/rolans-curse/\">Rolan's Curse</a> and Rolan's Curse 2.</p>",

Before players head out to the links they can choose whether to use a standard, match, skill, or power set of clubs and whether to use an amateur or professional tee.</p>\n<p>At each hole, players are given an overhead view of the course. Here they are given a draw/fade meter which effects how the ball is hit.\nAfter that is selected, a view of the golfer is shown with a power meter that ranges from 0 to 100%. The amount of power and the club used will effect the distance the golf swing will have on the ball.</p>",

He'll be going through Mr. Wilson's House, the Spooky Forest, the Sewers, the Adventure Park, the School and finally the Boiler Room.</p>\n<p>Although Dennis' choice of weapon is a slingshot, he can also tackle enemies with a pea shooter and water pistol all of which have unlimited ammo. Sometimes one of the three weapons are more effective on certain enemies. Around some parts of the Adventure Park, Dennis is required to swim his way. Three of the levels are boss levels (such as the Sewer Worker, the Gym Teacher and Switchblade Sam himself), where Dennis must repeatedly shoot the boss enemies while dodging hazards.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The angel Marlowe has a problem: he's on his way to a date with Nancy, but every flower in Bloomland has wilted! This just won't do. Luckily he stumbles across a small sun, named Phillip, and comes up with a solution: by shining light on every flower, they can quickly grow back up. This action-puzzle game is a bit like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Qix\">Qix</a> in reverse. Players control Marlowe as he flies around in a stage from an overhead view; meanwhile, Phillip moves on his own around a set path on either the outside of the level or the centre of a level. Pressing the A button fires a light beam from Phillip to Marlowe's position, hitting anything in the middle. Hitting a flower with a sunbeam will help it grow, with most flowers taking a few hits to grow completely. Enemies wander the stage, but hitting them with a sunbeam takes them out temporarily; sometimes, they'll drop powerup items as well. Holding B also speeds up Phillip, granting a little extra control over stages. Players start the game with a choice of several themed worlds, which they can complete in any order, and must complete all of the worlds in order to finish the game.</p>",

A round ends when either one player fills the word rack, or time runs out without either player being able to make another word. The game mode can either be played with a \"next letter\" or \"any letter\" mode, both solo and in two-player multiplayer.

You are tasked with defending your kingdom from invaders over the course of six stages, each of which contains several battles to complete. Most battles are mandatory to complete and backtracking is not possible, but most stages have a branching path, giving players a degree of choice in their approach. Not all spaces on the stage board involve battles \u2013 some spaces will give the player another chance to buy monsters, and others will present the player with a choice between three chests that can provide a random amount of points, a free monster, or nothing at all.</p>\n<p>Using a starting pool of 800 points, as well as any points earned from winning battles and occasional events, you must select from 16 different monsters to form your team for battle. Each monster has different HP, attack, and speed stats, and each monster also has a unique ability that can be used in battle. Some abilities simply deal damage to your opponent, whereas others can modify the opponent\u2019s stats or inflict a status effect.</p>\n<p>Combat takes place between you and the opponent and the goal is to eliminate all of their monsters while keeping yours alive. Each team\u2019s monster starts at one side of the field and must walk until they encounter the other monster. You have five commands to choose from during battle, which include moving, attacking, your monster\u2019s ability (which costs 30 points per use), the ability to heal in exchange for 20 points, and a push that sends your opponent back towards their starting point at the cost of 50 points. When the attack command is selected, you can press the A button to spend 2 points in order to have your attack come out faster, or you can press B and spend 5 points to do a jumping attack instead. Commands are selected by moving a cursor over them at the bottom of the screen, which will cause your monster to perform the command continuously until you move the cursor elsewhere. Monsters defeated in battle are removed from your roster permanently and points are earned at the end of the battle based on which of your monsters defeated the opponent\u2019s final monster.</p>\n<p>After every battle, a password is provided at the bottom of the screen, allowing players to continue where they left off or revert to a previous part of the game. If the player is defeated in battle, they are brought back to the title screen and must enter a password or start the game over.</p>",

As such, monsters, NPCs and even destinations on the world map are represented with a playing card asthetic. Gameplay itself is similar to many other RPGs including <em>Dragon Quest</em>.</p>\n<p>Players begin by choosing one of four characters, and must first purchase equipment for their character. You can recruit additional party members at the inn. Upon travelling to a destination, the player controls a top-down perspective where they \"flip over\" facedown cards representing the unexplored sections of that area. Occasionally monsters will be shown on the map and encountering them opens up a first person RPG battle menu. Defeating them will earn gold and experience points. There is a limit of 3 monster cards on the screen at any one time, however encounters can include more monsters who will take the place of a defeated monster.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Monster Maker 2: Uru no Hiten</em> is an RPG licensed from the 1988 Card Game. As such, monsters, NPCs and even destinations on the world map are represented with a playing card aesthetic. Gameplay itself is similar to many other RPGs including <em>Dragon Quest</em>.</p>\n<p>Meteors fall down from the sky changing the land into dungeons and making monsters appear. A villain named Zeo appears to command the monsters and send them across the land. Players control the Princess who along with her pet and her royal guard, go out on an adventure to save the land. The game is very similar to the first Monster Maker but with a greater emphasis on story and characters. Players must first purchase equipment for their character. The player controls a top-down perspective where they \"flip over\" facedown cards representing the unexplored sections of that area. Occasionally monsters will be shown on the map and encountering them opens up a first person RPG battle menu. Defeating them will earn gold and experience points. There is a limit of 3 monster cards on the screen at any one time, however encounters can include more monsters who will take the place of a defeated monster.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In Panel Action Bingo, players take on the role of a bird and compete against an AI cat to move around a 5X5 grid to try and earn Bingos. Panels must be claimed sequentially, meaning that players start with the panel numbered 1 and work their way up trying to grab the next number in the sequence before the cat does. Once a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical match is made, the round is won and the player moves onto the next one, but if no Bingos are made the victor is instead whoever claimed the most spaces. The cat and bird both need to move to the right spot to claim them and some boards will replace number panels with either a white barrier to prevent movement or a black hole that will lead to an instant loss if the player falls into it.</p>\n<p>There are 60 levels total consisting of 3 rounds each, a bonus round happening after the three rounds where the player cannot lose but needs to reach moles popping out of the ground before the cat to earn extra points. At the halfway point the game switches from counting up to counting down. Players can play with letters of the alphabet instead, the game leaving out letters from different parts of the alphabet depending on the stage. Settings can also be adjusted to make the game board slippery, prevent players from hogging spots by teleporting them after standing still for 3 seconds, or hide some or all of the Bingo tiles until a player tries to mark them. Panel Action Bingo can also be played against another human player.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based off of the original Pingu TV series, this game takes the player through four episodes. Throughout every episode, the player, or Pingu, can navigate through a side-scrolling world, which functions as a menu or map. Four landmarks are playable throughout the whole game and have nothing to do with the main goal of each episode; \"Pingris\" is a Tetris-like puzzle game, \"Fish Catch!\" involves capturing a set amount of fish within the time limit, \"Hide and Seek\" involves trying to find Pinga, Robby, and Pingo in different igloos, and \"15 Puzzle\" is a compilation of Pingu-related images with the activity of the same name. Completing all levels of any of these will allow the player to see Pingu do his signature dance from the TV show episode \"Pingu Looks After the Egg.\"</p>\n<p>The four video game episodes from start to finish are \"Fishing with Pingu,\" \"Pinga is Lost,\" \"Pingu's Ice Hockey,\" and \"Pingu's Snowball Fight.\" In the first episode, Pingu ate a whole fish and was told by his mother to go fishing for some more food. In the second, Pingu was asked to go outside with Pinga, only to accidentally lose her and to have to get her safe and sound again. In the third, Pingu accidentally broke a vase, and he must retrieve it by playing hockey with The Strikers. In the last episode, Pingu does a snowball fight with other penguins to cope with his mother solely giving her care and attention to Pinga. The minigames for each episode align with each respective plot; the first episode's main minigame involves fishing, the second has Pingu jump on floating platforms to Pinga, The third features Pingu playing one-on-one hockey, and the last involves the snowball fight.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Goths, a poaching organisation, suddenly appear in a peaceful jungle where humans and animals coexist, threatening, kidnapping and doing all manner of treacherous things. Jungle Papa (Papa), the peacekeeper of the jungle, goes out to patrol the jungle with his son, Jungle Boy (Boy), as usual, but falls for the Goths' tricks and is taken prisoner. Boy escapes in the nick of time thanks to Papa's quick thinking, and sets off on a journey to rescue Papa and restore peace to the jungle. The scenario moves between the jungle and city, and as well as Boy there are two other members of the party: a wizard girl (Mio) and sort of monkey child (Sasuke).</p>\n<p>The gameplay is reminiscent of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/436/dragon-warrior-dragon-quest-series/\">Dragon Quest</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/2924/momotaro-densetsu-series/\">Momotar\u014d Densetsu</a> series. There are random enemy encounters and the combat is turn-based with command selection menu. If the boy's HP reaches zero and he faints, he is defeated, even if the other two party members are combat-ready. If defeated, the player is sent to the hospital where he last stopped, and half of his gold is confiscated in the name of medical expenses, but his progress in the game is maintained. You level up when you gain a certain amount of experience. You can save at any time.</p>",

The first letter of the word is revealed from the beginning. If a guessed word contains a correct letter, it is marked with a square if in the right place and a circle if in the wrong place.

Knight must travel through dungeons, castles and towns, finding allies, fighting monsters and becoming strong enough to finally defeat the bad guy.</p>\n<p>Gameplay follows the standard DQ template in which gold and experience are gained through random turn-based battles against enemies. The battles are controlled through a menu that allows fighting, defending, using magic or items, or fleeing the battle. Knight starts the game alone, but can recruit additional party members. The game consists of several distinct quests accessed through magic doors. While they can theoretically be taken on in any order, they are designed in order of increasing difficulty.</p>",

Nano can attack by throwing his head at enemies, and can also carry a limited supply of bombs, with some obstacles only being vulnerable to bombs.</p>\n<p>This version is expanded from the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Hermano\">game jam version</a>, featuring 15 levels over five zones, three bosses and plenty of other improvements.</p>",

This entry isn't a full traditional platformer, but rather a minigame collection, featuring a variety of action-based minigames. In addition to some standalone platformer stages, others challenge the player to very different gameplay such as a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9001/breakout/\">Breakout</a>-style game in which PC Genjin acts as the paddle and players must jump and bonk the ball with their head to hit it back.</p>",
