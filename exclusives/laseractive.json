One to four players test their knowledge of environmental and climate facts in several themed stages. In between sets of questions, players travel through simple board game-style levels which affect the upcoming trivia. The questions are extremely difficult and assume a strong familiarity with climate science, so players are encouraged to replay the game many times in order to learn the answers.</p>",

All of the content is presented in a multimedia format, combining still images, high-quality animations and video, and voiceovers. Side A, \"Who are the dolphins?\", pairs informational content with minigames and quizzes. Players can either choose to browse the disc at their leisure, or they can take a guided tour that walks through the disc's contents in a set order. The tour opens with an introduction to the experts who consulted in the creation of the game, then walks players through dolphin physiology, communication, and social structures. Before continuing the tour, players are then led into an intermission that allows players to play the minigame <em>Hi Dolphin!</em>; watch a video of dolphins in action; and browse a photo gallery. <em>Hi Dolphin!</em> is a simple timing game in which tap a button in time with on-screen prompts, and are rewarded with cute and funny dolphin animations. The tour then continues with sections on dolphin encounters, healing, and human/dolphin coexistence.</p>\n<p>Side B, \"Dolphin Odyssey\", contains an interactive documentary pairing video and stills. It also contains a virtual fish tank feature.</p>",

The same approach was used on LD-ROM\u00b2.</p><p></p>\n<p>If it is about the story, Stefan is an artist who travels to a different city in search of work.
