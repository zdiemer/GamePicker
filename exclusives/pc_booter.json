        "description": "<p>Take control of a mechanical digging machine as you tunnel your way through the earth, searching for valuable gems and the even more valuable bags of gold! But watch out for Nobbins and Hobbins, and don't be careless enough to let the bags of gold crush you!</p>\n<p><em>Digger</em> is an arcade game combining elements of the popular arcade games <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/139/dig-dug/\">Dig Dug</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9764/mr-do/\">Mr. Do!</a>. Players control the titular 'Digger' that can tunnel through dirt with ease. The goal of each level is to gather up each of the gems, which allows you to progress to the next stage. However, Nobbins and Hobbins are also lurking within the levels - Nobbins are fairly slow, but transform into Hobbins which are much quicker. The enemies can only chase Digger through the tunnels he creates - they cannot dig through the dirt themselves.</p>\n<p>Digger's defenses consist of being able to shoot a single, rechargeable shot in the direction he is facing with F1 (which recharges after about thirty seconds), crushing his foes by digging underneath a gold bag and letting it plummet down, crushing anything in its path, or by collecting the bonus cherry that sometimes appears, causing Digger to become temporarily invincible.</p>",

The game can be played for up to two player(s) taking turns and select a difficulty level from novice, intermediate, to expert.</p>\n<p>The painting process consists of moving Rollo to paint in the outer lines of as many rectangular shapes of various sizes in the game. Successfully painting an entire section will automatically paint the entire rectangle and add points. Successfully painting all the rectangles will advance the player to the next level. While painting these sections, the player has to avoid the Brush Brothers, who at the beginning consist of two red slow moving brushes (always moving in the direction of Rollo) and one green fast moving brush (moves randomly). Later levels will include more Brush Brothers. Physical contact with them will automatically result in a loss of life (out of three lives). Another entity in the game is the eraser brush, which will erase any painted lines previously painted. This however, does not apply to squares that have been successfully painted.</p>\n<p>In later levels, the paint supply does not last forever. Pick up cans of paint when out of paint to continue the painting. Another power-up enables the player to kill the Brush Brothers, allowing the player to paint in peace until they regenerate again (indicated when the power-up song ends). Higher levels introduces more difficult challenges, among others but not limited to: faster movement of the Brush Brothers, requiring more than one lap to successfully paint a square, limited paint cans, etc.</p>",

The giant bird has the ability to run and to fly by constantly flapping its wings. Defeating pterodactyls is done by slamming into the pterodactyls (which bears no visual resemblance to actual pterodactyls) from a higher altitude; a lower altitude will result in death, while vertical altitude will result in the player and the pterodactyl bouncing off each other. Successfully slamming from a higher altitude will turn the pterodactyls into eggs, which may bounce away, as well as award the player with points. Additional points may be gathered by collecting these eggs.</p>\n<p>The game is divided into different rounds which will introduce more challenges: additional pterodactyls, which will spawn at any one of the eight green spawning areas; the lower ground will disappear and introduce wind current affecting the gravitational velocity of all moving objects in the game; the default six platforms may also change into fewer platforms; and an indestructible dragon may occasionally appear, resulting in instant death when collided with.</p>",

The gameplay is a mix between <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Galaxian\">Galaxian</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Defender\">Defender</a>.</p>\n<p>The alien bugs will attack you and swoop down and steal the uranium drums at the bottom of the screen. As they fly away with the drum, you have to shoot them before they reach the top of the screen to retrieve it. During the game, the space station on the left will load in all uranium drums and then make a connection to the satellite dish on the right, thus ending the level. At the end of each level you get 200 bonus points for each refueled uranium drum and -200 points penalty for each stolen drum.</p>\n<p>Occasionally a UFO will fly from left to right at the top of the screen. The blue box will display bonus points or the word \"combat\", indicating what you'll get if you shoot the UFO. Combat means you'll play a combat round where you have to shoot a horizontally moving alien as many times as possible. With each hit, you'll get 350 points and the alien will change direction and gain speed.</p>",

An alien space fleet has discovered the location of Earth, and - being an alien space fleet - immediately sets out on the attack. The only thing standing between the enemy and total Terran termination is you - the player, with your puny gunship that's stuck to the bottom of the screen and can only move left and right.</p>\n<p>Each stage pits you against a contingent of alien ships hovering menacingly above you. Occasionally, an enemy will break formation and go out on a sortie, diving towards you while shooting - only to re-emerge at the top of the screen. The different ship types have different offensive maneuvers. Shooting them in the midst of a dive scores more points than picking them off in formation; some will bring their buddies along and go out in triads, which net you a special bonus if destroyed in the right order. Another bonus is awarded for eliminating the command ship that comes along once per level, shoots at you and runs off.</p>\n<p>You can temporarily protect yourself by activating your shields (at the cost of your ability to fire) - knock down the occasional floating disc to get an extra one. You start with three ships, and gain a new one for every 2000 points scored. 9 difficulty levels are available.</p>",

Snacker is having another bad case of the munchies, and decides to explore the mazes for delicious gumdrops to gobble up. As before, he'll have to evade the Gumdrop Guards who seek to put a stop to his candy binge; each maze contains a number of magic stars that let him dine on the guards for a limited time, and special doorways that admit either Snacker or the guards, but not both. \nClear all three different mazes, and they'll repeat at a higher speed with tougher guards.</p>\n<p>This time, the game is further enhanced by new maze layouts, six difficulty levels, and enemies that vary in behavior and speed; the bonus foodstuff that sometimes appears gives Snacker a temporary speed-boost, too. The top score for each skill level is recorded on disk.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Paratrooper</em> is a single screen arcade action game where the player controls a stationary machine gun turret trying to shoot down all incoming enemies. The turret has unlimited ammo but a limited angle of fire (up to 90 degrees left and right). Each shot also costs one point, so the player must be conservative with ammunition when going for high scores.</p>\n<p>At first, helicopters start appearing from both sides of the screen's upper part. Paratroopers are jumping down from those helicopters; if four or more of them touch the ground, they will form a human ladder, climb up to the turret, and destroy it. To avoid that, the player has to shoot either the paratroopers themselves or their parachutes - for different effects but the same results.</p>\n<p>After the player has withstood several waves of helicopters, bomber planes start appearing. These planes shoot bombs directly at the turret, which do not miss and destroy it right away. To counter that, the player can either eliminate the plane before it has the chance to drop the bomb, or destroy the bomb itself in mid-air. Shooting bombs scores the most points (50).</p>\n<p>Surviving this stage effectively puts the game on an indefinite loop, with more helicopter and bomber plane stages alternating with increased difficulty. There are no continues and the player has to start over if the turret was destroyed.</p>",

Mankind is not thrilled with these reengineering efforts, and so the player assumes control of Earth's last best hope - a laterally moving gunship with a single-shot cannon. As the orderly alien squadron zig-zags its way towards the bottom of the screen, the player's task is to take them all down before they land or destroy all three ships.</p>\n<p>Only four destructible shields stand between the player and the aliens' genocidal mania, but they renew on each wave of attack. Some aliens release slow-moving bombs, others' are faster; destroying an invader scores a point value according to its type. From time to time a flying saucer will zoom across the top of the screen - these come in different sizes, and the smaller they are, the more they're worth when they're hit. <em>Space Strike</em> has 7 skill levels to choose from, and keeps track of the highest score for each level.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Floppy Frenzy</em>, players guide a floppy disk through a maze, being careful to avoid dust and magnets.</p>\n<p>Players can trap magnets in a trap, while using traps on dust will reduce the dust and make it harmless. Be warned though, as magnets get free after a while or if they touch another trap after they are trapped.</p>\n<p>There is also a timer. If the player does not use their traps on all the enemies within the time limit, they will die. If the player loses all three of their lives the game is then over. \nAfter each level the player gets to a bonus score screen, which shows how well they did within the time limit. The faster a player used their traps on all the enemies, the higher the bonus score multiplier.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>3-K Trivia</em> is a trivia game for up to six players. Each question round begins with a slot machine which randomly chooses three of the question categories (science, history, geography, nature, sports, show business and two mixed topics). Then the player (each participant is quizzed separately) chooses the category (provided that different ones appeared) and has to answer a trivia question by typing in the answer. </p>\n<p>Answering correctly awards a certain amount of points and the goal is to collect more than the other players. The specific amount is influenced by a number of factors, most importantly the spinning at the beginning of the round: when a category appears more than once, it is worth more points. There are also Joker cards which increase the stake. Points are deducted for using the help function (revealing a letter) or small differences (e.g. due to a typo) to the correct answer. When the result is tied after the last question was asked, the game continues one question at a time until one player wins.</p>\n<p>Options include setting the number of questions each player is asked (up to 25) and a 15 second time limit for answering. The game allows to add more questions.</p>",

You control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen and need to defend yourself from the waves of attacking enemies. Each time you clear the screen of all enemies, you move on to the next, more difficult round. Each round also has a time limit; if the time limit expires but you still haven't destroyed all of the enemies, you will move on to the next round anyway. There are eight different types of enemy ships that will appear, plus on many of the screens there is a shield which you will need to shoot through before you can hit the various ships. You begin the game with four lives, and additional lives can be earned for every 5,000 points. The game ends when you have lost all of your lives.</p>",

On each screen, you need to eat all of the fish to proceed to the next level. You will only be able to eat fish that are smaller than you, but as fish are eaten you grow in size.</p>\n<p>There are three different screens on which you need to eat fish: In the first screen you are in the open sea and need to dodge larger fish, a diver, and fishing nets from the boat on the surface while eating little white fishes to grow bigger and bigger.</p>\n<p>In the second screen you are in a narrow maze of fishing nets. You lose a life if your fish touches a net, and the bigger your fish gets the tougher it will be to navigate the maze! Eat the three pink fishes and a gap will appear on the right hand side of the screen, through which you can exit to the last screen.</p>\n<p>In the last screen you need to rescue your fellow fishes who are trapped in a net. As time ticks away they are captured onto a boat. Eat the little white fishes and avoid the fishing hooks, when you are big enough you can bite through the net and get bonus points for the remaining fishes.</p>\n<p>After all three screens are completed, the game repeats at a tougher difficulty level.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>ScubaVenture</em> you need to dive for treasures! Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by collecting rare fish and opening valuable treasure chests along the ocean floor. Each of the underwater caverns contains several locked treasure chests; keys for the chests can also be located somewhere in the cavern. By collecting the appropriate key and unlocking the matching chest you earn points, and if you can unlock all of the chests you move on to the next level. Collecting certain types of fish also earns points. Poisonous fish, seahorses, electric eels and sea weed can all be found in the caverns and will cause you to lose one of your three lives if you're not careful.</p>\n<p>The game screen continuously scrolls vertically; controlling your diver you need to avoid the cavern walls and obstacles while collecting the rare fish and treasures. When the end of the cavern is reached it will loop around back to the beginning allowing another chance to collect the treasures; if one of the two players can collect all treasures the next cavern begins. In the one player game the second diver is computer controlled and occasionally gets in the way while in the two player game both players compete for the same valuable items.</p>",

When you clear the screen you move to the next zone, 10 zones is called a fleet. After each fleet the game gets more difficult.</p>\n<p>In the first zones you face four of the same aliens, then alien types are combined. Starting from zone 30, the attack patterns are repeated only faster and with five aliens. You can start the game at four difficulty settings.</p>\n<p>Beginner - Start at zone 0 with 0 points. \nNovice - Start at zone 10 with 2000 points. \nAdvanced - Start at zone 20 with 4000 points. \nExpert - Start at zone 30 with 6000 points. </p>\n<p>As an extra gameplay element, you have a limited amount of fuel, if it runs out you die. The fuel is slightly refilled every time you shoot an alien. There are also bonus ships that sometimes appear at the top of the screen which (if shot properly) will drop a fuel ball. Catch it to refill the fuel bar. You also have torpedoes to kill all onscreen aliens, useful to skip the more difficult zones.</p>",

See your country safely through the upheavals of politics and economy, and if you're good enough, get elected for a second term - can you pull it off? the Oval Office has a seat all warmed up for you, so go ahead and try.</p>\n<p>As the President, you get to make the call on policy, and success will hang on your decisions in response to in-game events. Keep on top of major news stories, resolve situations of domestic crisis, sign and veto bills, make decisions on international affairs, and try to retain the approval of the public (and your supporting sectors in particular). You can rely on your political advisor for helpful analysis, and your Council will provide detailed reports on the economy, helping you prepare for the annual budget and tax proposals. The consequences of your decisions will be reflected in public approval polls and support from representatives.</p>\n<p>If this sounds too grave and overbearing, worry not: a touch of humor is always present to lighten things up. A scenario disk is included to enhance replayability - it contains event data which can be copied at random to the play disk (by choosing \"create a new version\").</p>",

However, the game doesn't keep score, doesn't show you the next piece, and doesn't speed up as you progress - these non-essentials have been dispensed with, making the game small enough to self-boot in half a kilobyte (without taking up any of the disk's visible space at all).</p>",

Granted, some compromises are made - no speed-ups or level advances, no \"next piece\" indicator, and the blocks (not lines) are counted in hex. The basic idea still stands: move, rotate or drop the random 4-block shapes as they fall, form complete horizontal lines to clear them, and try to prevent the pile from reaching the top of the well.

        "description": "<p>Among the first (if not the first) MUDs (multi-user dungeons) offered for commercial play, <em>Scepter of Goth</em> offered up parser-based text adventuring for up to 16 players simultaneously per game instance, from its launch in 1983 until at least 20 years later, at one Texas-based installation. While particulars regarding the game world are somewhat thin on the ground so many years after the fact, the basics of the default fantasy scenario remain concrete: gameplay revolved around the medieval town of Boldhome (though a variant version patterned after the Dragonlance Advanced <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dungeons+%26+Dragons\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> campaign setting was also available in some regions), containing such fixtures as Sharkey's shop, a newspaper stand, a combat arena and class-specific training areas.</p>\n<p>The environs saw players of various stock fantasy character classes, solo and in teams, travelling and teleporting about the area, making use of magic items, engaging and slaying monsters -- and each other, with early PVP a hazard in some areas. Additionally, human-controlled Dunjon Masters would appear on demand (to, eg., fulfil &gt;WISH spell effects invoked by high-level heroes or unexpectedly give voice to monster NPCs like a two-way security intercom), giving with their superuser powers the impression that the game could anticipate any player situation (rather than that a human gamemaster skilled at improvisation could deal with any of the game-limited situations players could come up with to throw at them.)</p>\n<p>Players accessed the game by dialling in via modem from terminals at their home location, paying flat fees for play time; instances of the game setup were franchised to different locations, allowing potential players in different area codes to have access to the game without being burdened by additional long-distance call charges.</p>",

As a Zuran Defender, your mission is twofold - cleanse the stellar neighborhood of Eclon forces, while locating and recovering survivors from incapacitated friendly ships.</p>\n<p>The galaxy is made up of nine quadrants on a 3x3 grid, connected by portals (which seal up behind you as you warp through); you get a long-range scanner to find your bearings.  Each quadrant is populated with obstructive asteroids, explosive mines and Eclon outposts, as well as damaged Zuran ships: you can beam survivors aboard if you park your ship nearby.  You'll also encounter larger structures - Eclon stations to be obliterated, and Zuran stations that let you re-energize your tanks.</p>\n<p>Eclon fighters will occasionally warp in to menace you, which means you'll have to use your shields or face certain termination (the same fate awaits you if you run out of energy, which is depleted by doing pretty much anything).  In tight spots you can rely on your hyperspace drive to get you out of trouble.  Points are given for taking out enemy craft... but taken away if you accidentally blow up a friend.</p>",
