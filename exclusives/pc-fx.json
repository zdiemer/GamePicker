        "description": "<p>In <em>Albarea no Otome</em> you play one of the three girls who were summoned to the castle of the Queen of Albarea to study fighting and magical arts (you can name your heroine as you like). As an additional reward - beside the graduation - you can try to impress and ultimately to win the heart of one of the five great knights of the kingdom. Your goal in the game is to make sure you become stronger and more charming than your two rivals, and to make a good impression on the Queen and the knights.</p>\n<p>You must plan a schedule for your studies in castle. You can choose which classes to visit and which not. Learning increases your abilities (for example, attending magic class will make your spells more powerful). Once in a while you'll have to help one of the knights to fight monsters. The battles take place on an isometric battle field, on which you can freely move your characters and attack or use spells when there are enemies in range. Your goal in battles is not only to win, but to make sure the heroine does some attacking instead of letting the powerful knights do the job.</p>",

The police chief rescues three little girls, each one of whom bears the traces of these experiments. Fast-forward fifteen years: the three young women - Saki, Lilis, and Ariel - now work for the Galactic Police, determined to find out the truth about their origins and the nature of experiments. They are sent on three dangerous missions - missions they might not survive...</p>\n<p><em>Team Innocent: The Point of No Return</em> is an adventure game with action elements. The game consists of three missions. The player controls Saki most of the time, but other girls temporarily become available as playable characters as well. The heroine must explore a large location, collecting items and solving a few puzzles on the way. The young women can also find and equip various weapons, from pistols to axes. The player can choose one of the four action modes: punching, kicking, shooting, and (in specific instances only) jumping. The girls are navigated from third-person perspective on pre-rendered backgrounds with constantly changing camera angles, similarly to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Alone+in+the+Dark\"> Alone in the Dark</a> games, except for the protagonists being sprites and not 3D models. The game has a few anime-style cutscenes and voice-overs for dialogues.</p>",

But his power was not enough for him, and he revived an ancient demon who had been sealed in a statue. But instead of granting him his power, the demon consumed the king's soul and possessed his body. He then swore to destroy humanity once and for all.</p>\n<p>After several years, the fake Siegwald led his armies to conquer lands and expand his empire. At that time, a warrior named Jay arrived at the port city of Heles. Now he must find loyal allies and eventually stop the Emperor's evil plans.</p>\n<p><em>Miraculum: The Last Revelation</em> plays like a traditional Japanese-style RPG, with a world map, towns and dungeons to visit, and enemies to defeat in random turn-based battles. The setting is mostly medieval fantasy, but there are sci-fi elements as well. The player's party can use a variety of moves in battles, and it is also possible to set the characters on AI mode, only assigning them general strategies. Graphically the game resembles typical 16-bit Japanese RPGs, but it has some anime-style movies, CD audio music, and voice-overs for important conversations.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In spite of its Japanese origin, <em>Lunatic Dawn</em> is in fact much more similar to very old-school Western RPGs than to its Japanese brethren. It has virtually no story and relies entirely on exploration and strategic combat. Set in a medieval world with little to no distinguishing characteristics, \"Lunatic Dawn\" throws the player immediately into the game world, which is open for him to explore. The player is able to choose the main character's gender, race (human, elf, etc.), class, and even age - older characters are more powerful, but have a more limited play time.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the entire gameplay process is timed. Traveling to a remote city or dungeon can take up to several game days. The player has to provide sufficient food for his party during this time. Player party consists of pre-generated characters, who have different names and belong to different races and classes, but have virtually no personality. Food and other supplies can be acquired in towns, through which the player moves in a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Wizardry\"> Wizardry</a>-like fashion - viewing locations from first-person perspective and selecting menu commands.</p>\n<p>When the party enters a dungeon, the view switches to isometric. The dungeons are large and maze-like, with enemies visible on screen. Upon contact with an enemy, a battle initiates. The battles are turn-based but fast-paced, reminding somewhat the Infinity Engine battles from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Baldur's+Gate\"> Baldur's Gate</a> series. The participants can freely move on the battle field. The player directly controls only the main characters, but can assign general commands to the party members.</p>",

Makend\u014d</a>, known outside of Japan as <em>Kendo Rage</em>. However, unlike the first game (or its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=makeruna+makendou+2\"> sequel</a>), this is a Japanese-style RPG. Like the other <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Makeruna!+Makendou\"> Makeruna! Makend\u014d</a> games (the name means <em>Don't lose, magic kendo!</em>), it has comedy elements. The story takes place in a high school attended by two sisters, Hikari and Mai. Their cousin Saya just came back to Japan from the USA, where she was sent as an exchange student. Due to an unfortunate experiment, the gate to the demon world opens in the school. Using their magic kendo powers, the girls have to find portals to the demon world, defeat the demons, and restore peace in the school.</p>\n<p><em>Makeruna! Makend\u014d Z</em> plays like a traditional Japanese RPG, with top-down navigation and random turn-based battles viewed from first-person perspective. The gameplay system is simplified even compared to other Japanese RPGs: game progression is strictly linear, and the girls cannot equip anything. They have, however, access to magic spells and various kendo techniques. </p>\n<p>The game features anime-style movies and still shots. Every kendo technique, for example, is displayed as a full-screen anime-style picture.</p>",

The player can choose to play as any of the good and evil characters (four for each clan) - but it is only possible to fight warriors of the opposing party.</p>\n<p><em>Battle Heat!</em>'s biggest innovation as a fighting game is the fact that every single move is viewed as a full-motion anime-style sequence. Each of the controller's buttons is assigned to a specific move (including jumping), and the moment the player presses it, it triggers the movie. The game features many different movies, including specific ones when, for example, a character is kicked down and immediately reacts with an attack of his own.</p>\n<p>It is possible to play the game in a tournament mode (for Republic of Kriph only), or choose a free battle, which also makes it possible to play as the bad guys.</p>",

The manga tells the story of a little girl named Cha-Cha who lives with her teacher on a mountain and studies magic. In the anime, the story was expanded to include the villainous Demon King, whom Cha-Cha and her best friend Riiya, a werewolf boy, must eventually defeat.</p>\n<p><em>Akazukin Cha-Cha: Osawagase! Panic Race!</em> is a board game for up to six players. Each player corresponds to a character from the TV series. It is also possible to play just as Cha-Cha and to let the AI control the other characters. Each player advances on the board by throwing dice. Landing on different fields leads to different results: finding items, being attacked, etc. The game's strategy elements are expanded by giving each character unique statistics and abilities, that have to be used under special circumstances. Certain obstacles are only solvable if two or more characters gather on the same field. </p>\n<p>Taking a cue from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Battle+Heat\"> Battle Heat</a>, \"Akazukin Cha-Cha\" accompanies every single move by an anime-style FMV.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The game is based on Go Nagai's manga, that was later made into anime TV series. Rather than following the plot of the manga, the game has the player assume the role of a nameless male detective, who is headed to a fictional country called Austral Island in search of a missing girl. When the hero arrives on the island, he soon discovers that there is some sort of a supernatural organization that might be the reason for the girl's disappearance. Then he hooks up with Honey Kisaragi, the heroine of the manga and TV series, who is an android that can assume various combat forms and fight evil creatures.</p>\n<p>This is an adventure game with simple interaction (point-and-click), the cursor turning blue for looking at objects and yellow for using them or talking to people. At some screens there are multiple dialogue choices. There are no puzzles in the game, but sometimes the player controls Honey in combat sequences, which play like a mini-game that involves pressing a button as many times as possible within a time limit, and choosing vulnerable spots on the enemy's body to execute attacks. There is also a map of the island which the player can navigate the main character on. </p>\n<p>Unlike many other Japanese adventures, characters are animated on almost every screen in <em>Cutey Honey FX</em>, and a large portion of the game is occupied by anime-style movies.</p>",

There are two playable characters, both of which are little girls. There is no difference between them gameplay-wise: both use a large blob-like animal to hit enemies from a short distance in a yo-yo-like fashion. It is possible to choose one of them as a single player, or to use them both cooperatively in the two-player mode.</p>\n<p>Each level of the game is divided into 10 stages, all of which are single screens with platform constructions. The player must eliminate all the enemies who wander around the stage before being able to advance to the next one. Once the enemy is successfully hit with the blob, the enemy becomes stunned for a short while. It is then possible to kick him off screen. Defeated enemies turn into random power-ups, which include speeding up the character, making her have two or even three blobs instead of one, adding an extra life, making her invincible for a while, etc. The 10th stage of each level requires the player to defeat a boss. The bosses have two forms: the first is a character the same size as the player character, which takes a while to defeat and which has the ability to revive regular enemies; the second form is a traditional platform game over-sized monster. The monsters have different attacks, including projectiles and generating smaller enemies, and have to be hit many times with the blob to go down.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Comicroad</em> is a \"life simulation\" game, starring a young girl (whom the player names themselves) who dreams of becoming a manga artist. In order to become successful, she has to do more than just draw well; it is important to develop other aspects of her personality, and also keep an eye on the finances, otherwise working too much might deteriorate her drawing skills. Social life, physical exercises, reading - everything has consequences!</p>\n<p>The gameplay consists mainly of making decisions (through menu choices); there is no player character navigation in the game, except shops, which are viewed from first-person perspective. There is a variety of ways to manage the girl's life. The player can make a schedule for a whole month, or decide every day what to do. Every action has an effect on the heroine's parameters. For example, just resting every day reduces physical shape and appeal. Working on the manga increases respective skills. It is possible to call friends and spend time with them, or go shopping. There are many items in the game, all of which influence the heroine's stats in that or another way - for example clothes, drawing accessories, books, or even a PC-FX console, that can be bought in an electronics store for about 20000 yen.</p>",

After having successfully saved the Earth, Yuna and her new friend, the ever-hungry female android Yuri Cube, return to their normal high school life - or so they think. Because her old enemies will do anything to destroy her, including wrongly accusing her of world domination plans. This draws the attention of a highly ranked female intelligence officer of the Galaxy Alliance, who operated under codename \"Sirene\" and who pretends to be an exchange student in the Shiraokadai High School, while her true goal is to arrest Yuna...</p>\n<p><em>Kanashimi no Sirene</em> plays similarly to the other games in the series, with the main gameplay consisting of being taken automatically to different screen and making dialogue choices. There are also turn-based battles, during which the player has to choose the right attacks at the right time to defeat the opponents. There are also a few mini-games that appear during the course of the game, such as a quiz show and a slot machine-type game with the purpose of getting new clothes for Yuna. There is an extensive \"Extras\" menu in the game, which features character album, graphical sketches, photos of various material connected to the series (such as magazines or covers of previous games) etc.</p>",

Enno's descendant, a lovely young girl named Chiaki, has no choice but to use her bracelet to summon Zenki! But while being sealed, Zenki has reverted to the form of a nasty, greedy little boy. Chiaki must evoke the power of bracelet to make Zenki fight on her side, and destroy the demons!</p>\n<p><em>Vajra Fight</em> is what is commonly called a beat-em-up game, similar to games like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Final+Fight\"> Final Fight</a> and others. Controlling either Zenki or Chiaki (or both in two player mode), the player must typically eliminate a number of enemies on a screen until he/she is allowed to proceed. Zenki fights melee-style, while Chiaki uses ranged energy balls; she can also summon Zenki with the bracelet power-up to inflict massive damage. Zenki and Chiaki can also execute various special attacks, which can be mapped to the controller for quicker access. There are many boss fights in the game, some stages consisting of one large-scale boss battle.</p>",

The game is set in a magical land ruled by women, namely the benevolent goddess Mamamega, with the dark goddess Yamimama constantly trying to defeat her and take over. Each goddess is surrounded by \"shrine maidens\", all of which are young and pretty girls. </p>\n<p>The game lets the player control any of the eight shrine maidens, four on Mamamega's side (Rurubell, Lilith, Stashia, and Juliana), and four on Yamimama's side (Rouge, Pastel, Angela, and Maharaja). It is possible to switch between girls on the same side, but not between those of the opposing camp. The goal of the game is to gather as many followers as possible. The player navigates his favorite shrine maiden through the vast top-down world of Megami Paradise, trying to recruit as many people as possible on their side. The girls can talk to people using different approaches (sweet, passionate, etc.). They can buy a variety of items to increase their parameters and hence their appeal factor to the average citizen. Changing clothes also helps sometimes. There are also some battles, which utilize a slot machine system, and other mini-games. The game has a night/day cycle (much faster than real time); some places will be open only during the day or vice versa. The goal has to be achieved within a year of game time.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Oj\u014dsama S\u014dsam\u014d</em> is based on the anime series <em>Debutants Detective Corps</em>, which tells the story of a group of young girls, led by the wealthy Ayanokouji sisters, which have received a threatening letter and decide to work as detectives to find out who has sent it. However, the game doesn't follow this story and instead puts the player into the shoes of a nameless male thief, whose goal is to outsmart the girls and to steal valuables successfully!</p>\n<p>This is an adventure/puzzle game. The player navigates the thief through isometric locations. Each location typically contains dangerous spots that would deplete the thief's HP, and puzzles to solve, for example complex mazes with one-way-tiles. If the girls are close, the thief will hear a warning voice. Once a girl appears, it is possible to fight her in turn-based combat, but that requires weapons or other items, which should be found and which are not always readily accessible. If the hero's HP reaches zero, he is caught by the girls and put in prison.</p>",

The popular pachinko mascot Pachio-kun, who looks like a pachinko ball with legs, is setting up a pachinko tournament on the Ghost Island. The player can choose to control one of the several available characters; even though the choice doesn't affect the gameplay, choosing different characters leads to different anime FMVs displayed during pachinko moves. The goal is to defeat the 7 pachinko masters, who can be met and challenged to a battle at different locations on the island. The battles involve not only using your own pachinko machine, but also freezing the ball the opponent is currently playing for an amount of time. This can be done by playing alone in various pachinko parlors and gathering balls and special points.</p>",

Every location has at least one camp, where the player can switch characters.</p>\n<p>The large locations have multiple exits, and it is often necessary to return to a location with different characters to unlock new areas or an exit to a new location.

        "description": "<p>The hero of the game is in his space ship, on the way to his home planet. But the space ship crash-lands on the Earth. The hero is on an important intergalactic mission and has to be on his home planet no later than in one month. He tries to figure out what caused the crash, and discovers that it was a voice that interfered with the ship's radio waves. Suddenly, three anime girls appear in front of him. They are Citron, Jasmine, and Cinnamon, the heroines of a TV anime series called \"Elfin Triangle\". They explain that the voice that caused the disturbance was that of a famous Japanese voice actress.... they just don't know which one. To get a sample of this voice would be the only hope to repair the ship... so the hero and his three lovely companions have to find out who the voice belongs to!</p>\n<p><em>Voice Paradise</em> plays, for the most part, like an adventure game with an internal schedule. A visit to every locations costs one game day, and the hero has only 30 days to find the voice actress. The locations include TV studio, CD shop, and other locations that have anything to do with anime and voice acting. The game contains plenty of material about Japanese voice actresses, so it can be described as educational. In order to successfully locate the actress, it is necessary to gather as much information as possible and take part in quiz that would narrow down the search and bring the hero nearer to the goal.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Long time ago, there was a happy country called the Eternal Feather Kingdom. Protected by benevolent deities, it flourished until a disaster came: a demon destroyed the kingdom, and it disappeared off the face of the earth. But a few chosen ones, called \"Feathers\", continued to keep sacred gemstones, which allowed them to use unique powers in the fight against the demonic army. Each Feather protects a gem, and the protector of the Ruby gem is the protagonist of the game - an ordinary high school boy from our modern world who at first wants nothing to do with ancient prophecies and heroic deeds. But as he receives new power from the leader of the Feathers, he understands that his destiny is to fight evil, and perhaps restore Eternal Feather to its former glory.</p>\n<p><em>Sparkling Feather</em> is a turn-based strategy game with slight RPG and \"dating sim\" elements. Large-scale battles of the Feathers against demons take place on isometric battle fields. The heroes move on the battle field, attack with weapons when an enemy is in range, and use offensive and healing magic. The party levels up automatically after having won a battle. Between battles, the player can play a roulette-type game, which may allow him to have a date with one of the Feathers (female and male!). During the date the player can choose conversation topics, and depending on his choices the parameters of the companions can increase or decrease.</p>",

So Rolfee and her family - including a cute little animal called Nyai - move to Japan. Rolfee has to go to high school, and she hopes to study well and make friends. Will she have success in the school? Will she be liked by her classmates? Will she not quarrel too much with her family? It all depends on the player!</p>\n<p><em>Tonari no Princess Rolfee</em> is a Japanese-style adventure game with some mild simulation elements (Rolfee has parameters that can increase or decrease, depending on the player's actions). Most of the interaction consists of choosing which location to go to (through a menu command). A somewhat unusual feature of the game are its random events. Going to a certain location will trigger random appearances of characters, so there are no clear and secure ways to make certain events happen. Triggering different events leads to different consequences in the story and different endings.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Galactic Emperor Zemu is conquering one planet after the other, planning to expand his empire to the known limits of the galaxy. The reason for his success are huge robots who fight in his armies, developed with the technology invented by the genius scientist Dr. Lulu. But the doctor understands herself that her inventions have caused misery and destruction to other nations. She runs away, taking design plans for the giant robots with her. She arrives on the Earth (Japan, to be exact) shortly after World War II, and with the help of local scientists, develops a powerful robot, that alone can protect Earth from Zemu's attacks: Super God Trooper Zeroigar!</p>\n<p><em>Zeroigar</em> is the only shooter for the PC-FX system, continuing the legacy of vertically scrolling shooters from the PC Engine (TurboGrafx) era. The player controls Zeroigar as a plane and as a robot (for boss battles). As in most shooters, power-ups appear frequently. Every level starts with the default weapon, which can be enhanced with these power-ups. Secondary weapons (bombs, torpedoes, etc.) can also be found. A somewhat unusual feature of \"Zeroigar\" is its leveling-up system. The player is awarded experience points, depending on his performance during a stage. After completing a stage (or after a Game Over screen), the player is able to use those points to increase Zeroigar's parameters (health, defense, weapon power, etc.). The player is given unlimited continues, but he has to begin the level from the first screen each time. Anime-style movies advance the story between levels.</p>",

The actress deals a card, and the player must guess whether the next card will be higher or lower within a time limit. Guessing correctly will give the player a star, which will be accumulated at the top left corner of the screen. Guessing wrong pushes the player back to the beginning of the game, so what really matters is winning as many times as possible in a row, gathering stars in the process.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The fifth installment of the series brings back mini-games, and this time with something far more challenging than the simple luck-based games from the first three volumes: a quiz game. The quiz is all about NEC's two consoles, PC Engine (TurboGrafx) and PC-FX, ranging from game-related to technical questions. Not only does this quiz require extensive knowledge of the consoles, but it is also timed.</p>\n<p>Other than this quiz, Vol. 5 contains most of the regular stuff seen before (Making Of, anime database, etc. - without the karaoke mode this time though). It continues the anime mini-series <em>Prism Knights</em> from the previous volume. It also has full walkthroughs for several PC-FX games. </p>\n<p>Vol. 5 takes a decisive step towards less kid-friendly approach: it contains a large collection of videos of various anime-style girls (from PC-FX games or otherwise) changing clothes. There is no explicit nudity, but it comes close! This volume also has videos of voice actresses in bikini on a beach and in an amusement park.</p>",

Unfortunately, by that time PC-FX was nearly extinct, so Vol. 6 contains a trailer for only one game - one last game for PC-FX: <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/43199/first-kiss-story/\"> First Kiss Story</a>. It also lacks many of the features available in other issues of Anime Freak, such as karaoke mode, news section, or walkthroughs. It concludes the mini-anime series <em>Prism Knights</em> and <em>Kodomo no Omocha</em>, started in previous two issues. New material available in this volume includes interviews with voice actors, as well as a detailed video about working in recording studios. </p>\n<p>The game in this volume is the same as in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Anime+Freak+FX:+Vol.+1\"> first volume</a> (albeit against a different actress), namely \"Rock, Paper, Scissors\".</p>",
