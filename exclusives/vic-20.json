        "description": "<p><em>Galaxia</em> is an arcade style shooter. You control a spaceship and need to earn as many points as possible by shooting the various enemies that appear on the screen. Unlike many similar games (such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9448/demon-attack/\">Demon Attack</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Phoenix\">Phoenix</a>) your ship can move about the entire screen and is not limited to horizontal only movement. On each level there is a timer; if time runs out and you haven't finished destroying all of the enemies, the next level will begin, however all of the remaining enemies from the previous level will remain on the screen (so you now have two sets of enemies to destroy at once). There are many different types of enemies to destroy which become faster and more numerous as the levels progress.</p>",

Along the way you will encounter a variety of enemy creatures which will need to be defeated in combat. Only released for the VIC-20, it is a simple maze game with some monster battles, and very little connection to the other games in the series.</p>",

That's not as easy as it sounds though. To enter the tomb 500 units of treasure needs to be collected. Treasure is gained by doing various tasks that you will randomly be assigned as you make your way through the maze. These tasks are mini games of different kinds. Some are action based and some only depend on luck. Examples of tasks are surviving a earthquake, avoid being run over by camels, and running away from snakes. Fail with three tasks and it's game over.</p>",

You have two minutes to eliminate as many jewels as possible from the playfield by swapping a pair of jewels around, forming a row of three or more of the same colour. Swapping pairs is only possible if the swap will result in same-colored rows. As the rows are formed, they disappear, and the jewels above fall down, with more coming in from above, making this an endless game were it not for the time limit. For each eliminated jewel, you score 10 points, with bonus points given for arranging <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Puyo+Puyo\">Puyo Puyo-style</a> chain reactions.</p>",

Coloring all tiles clears the level. This would be easy were it not for the enemies moving around in haphazard patterns on the same pyramid. Unlike the original Q*Bert enemies, they don't change back the color of the game tiles, but contact is deadly. Another way to die is to fall off the pyramid. Later levels require coloring the same squares multiple times, and even later, you cannot pass the same square twice without changing the color back, so a strategy element is introduced.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A simple but technically accomplished game for the VIC-20, <em>Dragonwing</em> puts you in a spaceship flying through a system of caves at a very fast pace. As you move along, and try not to crash into the undulating cave walls, you expend fuel, and must pick up new fuel supplies from the cave floor. Unlike <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Scramble\">Scramble</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10840/super-cobra/\">Super Cobra</a>, flying through the caves is not easy, even though they are not guarded by missile silos. Since your vehicle is not a helicopter, but a rocket, you fly through the caves at a very fast pace and without stopping. The laws of gravity an inertia mean that you can't adjust your pace with pixel precision. Instead, your altitude must be consistently altered so that you do not crash into the ground, while you have to compensate your maneuvers so as not to crash into the ceiling.</p>\n<p>Programmed in 2002, Dragonwing has little in common with the VIC-20 games of twenty years earlier, what with multicolor sprites, smooth fast scrolling and a breakbeat soundtrack played throughout the game, despite running on an unexpanded VIC-20.</p>",

This is a side-scrolling shooter with the same kind of space ship, the same kind of aliens and the same kind of landscape as Defender, but without all the technicalities of that game. You don't rescue humans, and the scroll is forced in one direction. You simply have to shoot your way through hordes of aliens, with more and more of them occupying the screen as you progress. The aliens are mostly fixed in their position, but will sometimes move a step up or down to get in your way. As you progress further, additional alien types are introduced.</p>",

As usual, you fly with a ship through a system of caves, but this cave lacks the usual roof. You shoot or drop bombs at the usual missiles, saucers and fuel pods, but in this version, you don't shoot and bomb simultaneously. Bombs are released by pulling back on the joystick with the fire button pressed. Of course, this means that you can't go back and forth as usual, instead your ship is glued to the back of the screen. While the scrolling is forced, pushing forward makes it speed up, so that you can fly away from missiles and other threats. As you go deeper into the caves, the border colour changes.</p>",

You fly above a coarse landscape filled with missiles, factories and fuel supplies. Bomb the fuel supplies in order to refill your own fuel, and bomb the rest for points. The missiles are inactive at the beginning, but after a while, they start to launch in order to intercept you. After that, the mountainous landscape turns into a cave, with thin passages that must be navigated while spider-like things fly in your path. You have only one life, after that it is game over for you.</p>",

You have a gun mounted at the bottom of the screen. Above are three rows of targets moving around. The targets consist of rabbits, owls, duck and boxes with numbers. You move your gun left and right in order to hit the targets, and you earn more scores for hitting those on the higher rows. You have a limited amount of bullets, but hitting the numbered boxes add more to your arsenal. While the rabbits and owls require just one hit, the ducks will change colours several times before being eliminated. When only five targets remain, the screen changes colour and they must be hit before they leave the screen forever. As you progress, the speed is elevated.</p>",

You don't have any barriers for protection against the enemy formations, instead you have a barrier above them. This barrier protects seven space aliens from a lone yellow invader who patrols the upper portion of the screen. Shoot down the invader formation without hitting the barrier, or you might end up hitting the trapped aliens. When all the white aliens are dead, it's game over time, and that is also the case when you are killed.</p>",

Drop bombs on fuel silos to avoid crashing. Early enemies are rockets launching from the ground while shooting at you, followed by enemies hovering around in the air, missiles flying fast in your direction, aliens bouncing up and down in your path, a fleet of spaceships and swarms of aliens. </p>\n<p>Another enemy is the landscape itself. Avoid crashing into the walls of the levels during evasive manoeuvres. The landscape never really narrows down like in so many other scramble clones, but instead there are formations like stalactites and stalagmites, much like in <em>Super Cobra</em>. The aliens regenerate unless you pound them repeatedly.</p>\n<p><em>Fire Galaxy</em> uses a character based scroller, scrolling in 8-pixel increments, with big sprites on a large screen.</p>",

Blocks of three vertically arranged colours, out of a pallette of four, come dropping down from above, and must be placed on the bottom or on top of another block. By pressing fire, you can rotate the colours inside the block so as to fit in with the colours of other blocks already placed on the screen. If three or more adjacent blocks have the same colour on a row or column, that colour block is eliminated, making room for more blocks. Carefully laying down the blocks can lead to chain reactions. Unlike the original Columns, though, this implementation does not recognise diagonal colour combinations.</p>",

Three buttons regulate four functions: moving up and down, shooting and dodging.</li>\n<li><em>Scramble</em> -- a game of aerial bombardment</li>\n<li><em>Alien Marauders</em> -- likely a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a> clone</li>\n<li><em>Airplane</em> -- \"Attempt to land your passengers safely on the runway at La Guardia Airport.\" A simulation of landing an airplane consulting only cockpit instrumentation. \"Good luck. It may take practice to land correctly. I can't!\"</li>\n<li><em>Marathon</em> -- the player places bets on one of three athletes, then the computer simulates a foot race between and lets the player know how their financial speculation turned out. \"The game continues until you are broke or you break the bank.\"</li>\n<li><em>Wizard</em> (or <em>Computer Wizard</em>) -- a \"Simon-says\" iterative song-repeating game</li>\n<li><em>Tail Gunner</em> -- a gunsights-aiming game (using the almost-standard WADX control keys)</li>\n<li><em>Astro Wars</em> -- also sounds very <em>Space Invaders</em>-y. Only so many distinguishing characteristics can be gleaned by eyeballing the source code.</li>\n<li><em>Swarm</em> -- a game about intercepting the trajectory of enemy spacecraft on a collision course</li>\n<li><em>3-D Maze</em> -- wherein the player attempts to set a speed record for plotting a course to maze cell #25, in an eerie textmode first-person perspective.</li>\n<li><em>Brands Hatch</em> -- a topdown car racing simulation whose goal is primarily to avoid colliding with other vehicles or the sides of the road.</li>\n<li><em>Lightning Bolt</em> -- a somewhat conceptually abstract game, the player here attempts to intercept the tip of a descending lightning bolt with a cursor-drawn wall without touching the bolt's sides.</li>\n<li><em>Space Birds</em> -- a <em>Space Invaders</em>-y top-down space shooter with a backstory almost as long as the source code listing.</li>\n<li><em>Arkenstone</em> -- an explicitly <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/47273/j-r-r-tolkien/\">Tolkien</a>-derived early text adventure game with an unusual text parser, accepting input of strings up to nine words long one[enter]word[enter]at[enter]a[enter]time[enter][enter].</li>\n<li><em>Gomoku</em> -- the Asian parlour game whose goal is getting five stones in a row. \"WARNING: This program takes a few minutes to make its move.\"</li>\n<li><em>Lunar Lander</em> -- a simple conversion apparently unconstrained by fuel limitations.</li>\n<li><em>Earth Defense</em> -- a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Missile+Command\">Missile Command</a> clone.</li>\n<li><em>Nightmare Castle</em> -- the description is peculiarly abstract (\"THE ROOM is a strange place.

Earn as many points as possible by shooting and collecting stuff in a static, fixed-screen maze.</p>\n<p>However, the game is original due to the variety of on-screen stuff. There are some monsters which you need to shoot, and which will kill you. There are flashing items you need to pick up (for points only); if you accidentally shoot them (which will happen due to the speed of the game), they will disappear and reappear elsewhere. Finally, there are small yellow spider eggs which, if not destroyed, will hatch small yellow spiders, and these spiders will, if not destroyed, finally evolve into blue spiders, which you cannot destroy, only paralyze for a while.</p>",

There are a dozen mazes in the game and they are randomly chosen at start up. The game features six levels of difficulty. On the easier levels the player is presented with both a top down perspective and a first person perspective of the maze. On the more difficult levels the top down view is disabled and the player has to make his way through the maze with only the first person view.

        "description": "<p>In <em>King Tut</em> the player takes the role of Archie, a lion-hearted explorer who has entered the tomb of Tutankhamun, the Egyptian pharaoh. In his quest for gold and glory he has to traverse the maze like corridors of the tomb until he finds the famed golden death mask. The game is played from a side view. At the start the player has a good view of his surroundings and can locate the position of the mask. However, the player's lamp is not reliable and will go out after a short time. The tomb will then become shrouded in darkness and the player will only be able to see what he is next to. So thereby the game gets a lot harder if the player is too slow. The player is not alone in the tomb. He has to watch out for it's guardians (mummies, scorpions, spiders and snakes) who will instantly kill him when he gets to close. When completing the game the player gets a score based on how much gold he collects.</p>",

The player has a side view of the ocean and can move his ship, The Victorian Rose, left and right along the surface. In his search for treasure he uses a diving bell which can be moved up and down. The treasure is not visible from the start and the player has to use the bell to find it. It beeps when it's getting close. When the treasure is found the screen flashes and the bell automatically picks it up. After that it only has to be pulled up to the ship. Due to the dangers of the sea this might not be as easy as it sounds. Serpents swim around in the ocean and the player has be careful so they don't swim into the bell and its cable. If it hits the bell and the crew inside will be lost. Another problem is the storms which appear in the sky at times. When the clouds are above the ship it won't be able to move.</p>",

The player controls a gun at the bottom of the screen. From the top alien saucers will appear and move towards the player. On the saucer is an addition problem that the player has to figure out. If he types the right answer the alien will be shot down and another will appear. Input the wrong number and the alien will continue towards the player. It's game over when the alien reaches the player. The player wins if he manages to defend earth for two minutes. Before the game the player can choose a difficulty level. In the harder difficulties the aliens move faster and the problems are harder.</p>",

To do this he uses six laser guns, three on each of the base's sidewalls. The meanies fall from the sky and the player has to shoot them down before they can do any damage to the base. Using the lasers cost energy and when the energy is out the weapons won't work. At times supply ships land with more energy. It's important to not shoot these down as it leads to a reduction of points. To fix the holes caused by the meanies the player can use a repair robot. This however costs a large amount of energy.</p>",

One such young man is Englishman Ricky Rockman who aims to dig his way through the mines and return home with plenty of riches. It's not an easy job though. Not only has he watch out for falling boulders but also the vile creatures that patrol the mines. </p>\n<p><em>Rockman</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Boulder+Dash\">Boulder Dash</a> variant. The aim of the game is to collect all the diamonds for each level. Throughout the levels are also boulders and monsters that wander around. Boulders follow the laws of gravity and fall down when the player digs a hole below them. The player then has to be quick or he might be crushed by them. Boulders can also be used to kill the monsters. When all diamonds in a level has been collected a gate leading to the next will open. The player has three lives and they will be used if he comes into contact with a monster or is crushed by a boulder. There is also a time limit.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Bullet</em> the player takes the role of a bank robber who has the chance to rob four banks. The game consists of two parts. The first part is a clone of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Head+On\">Head On</a>. The player races his car through a maze consisting of three lanes and has to pick up all the coins that are scattered around. In the opposite direction comes a police car that the player has to avoid crashing into. Once all coins have been collected he gets the chance to rob the bank. This is the second part of the game and is most reminiscent of a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/3173/snake-variants/\">snake</a> game. The banks appear on the screen one at a time and the player has to drive over them. At the same time the car leave a trail that the player has to avoid crashing into. The player has four lives to complete his task.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Money Wars</em> the player takes the role of a robber that has to retrieve and deliver bags of money without getting shot. The game is viewed from a side perspective. The player starts at the left side and has to move across the screen to the money bag that lies on the right side and then return to his starting position. From the top deadly arrows are shot towards him and these he has to dodge or he will lose a life. To his help he has three brick barricades that he can hide behind. He can't hide too long though as the barricades take damage from the arrows and will after a while be gone. The player can use two special functions. One that increases speed and one that creates a force field that destroys arrows. These cost energy and the player is awarded bonus points for the amount of energy he has left. When a bag of money has been delivered another one appears and the game goes on until the player has lost all of his three lives. For every fifth money bag delivered the player progresses to a new level.</p>",

Spiders appear and fly across the screen to make your job even harder, and spores drop down, leaving a line of cacti in its path. Shoot both of these for bonus points. Get rid of the scorpions to proceed to the next level. Contact with any one of the creatures will result in a loss of life, and losing all your lives ends the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Gold Fever!</em> is an action game with platform elements in which the player controls a miner searching for gold. At the beginning of the game the miner is at the uppermost tiers of the mine. Scattered around the five levels of the mine are little piles of gold. The goal is to move towards them and pick them up. To move the miner safely from level to level the player steers him up or down the vertical shafts in the floors. There are complications, such as runaway ore carts, which interfere with the miner's progress by knocking him down. Three collisions and the player is out of miners, ending the game. The miner will be able to jump over the obstructions if the player times the jumps perfectly. This adds from 30 to 40 points to the player's score. If the miner can cross a chasm by running across a boxcar, he earns another 20 points.</p>\n<p>The miner's troubles also include having to jump over a murderous claim jumper who will, from time to time, ambush him. Sometimes it is also necessary to leap over boulders. Moving from one tier to the next before the rocks appear on screen doesn't help the player evade them; they always appear on the same tier as the miner. </p>\n<p>Once the miner has collected all the gold on the screen, he can make a run for the exit at the lower left of the screen and begin the process on the next level. Each of the nine levels becomes increasingly difficult as the player proceeds. The miner needs to collect more gold on each succeeding level, the obstructions are faster, and as a result the player must change the timing of the jumps. The oxygen supply is limited, and slow-moving miners tend to suffocate.</p>",

On some of the levels, you encounter mostly smart bombs. More than a dozen can be in the air at a time. You will be forced to spend most of your time in evasion, unable to aim your bombs. Rockets are fired at you by in heavy numbers, several volleys at a time. With the skies packed with missiles, you will find it hard to thread a safe path, even though they aren't homing in on you.</p>\n<p>The reward of reaching the higher levels are the banks of asteroids slicing through the air in deadly clusters. Even though you collect a point for each hit on them, they very effectively block your attack against the targets down below.</p>\n<p>At the 17th (out of 32) level of the game, the speed of the game increases twofold, making it twice as dangerous flying, and throwing off the timing you gained in the first 16 levels.

The mazes are full of riches but there are also lots of creatures that will do all they can to protect it. That's not enough to stop this adventurer though and it's up to the player to help him out. Each level consists of four diamonds that the player has to pick up. At the same time he has to avoid getting killed by the monsters that wander around the corridors. To his help he has a gun that he can use to shoot the creatures as they get close. Once all the diamonds have been picked up, an exit will open up that takes the player to the next level. The exit will also open when the player has killed all the monsters before collecting the diamonds. The player has four lives at the start of the game and each time he collects all the diamonds of a level he earns an extra one. More and tougher enemies are encountered as the player progresses through the levels.</p>",

The game is most similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Centipede\">Centipede</a>. The ants attack in rows, moving horizontally one line at a time until they get to the player who moves around in the lower sections of the screen. Unlike Centipede there are no obstacles when starting out, but as the player shoots his web at the ants a wall of webbing is created. These causes the ants to change their direction. In addition to ants there are gnats and flies that can carry ants and open up passages in the wall. There are also wasps that moves across the screen at times. The game goes on until the eggs hatch or they have all been taken by the ants. Once the eggs hatch the player moves on to a new and tougher level.</p>",

The game is played on a single screen and the player can move and shoot in any direction. Around alien creatures roam and the player has to shoot them down before they collide with him or her. The only defence available is a football-shaped electronic alien zapper that is thrown at the aliens. Unlike Robotron, it's played with only one joystick and therefore the player can only shoot in the direction of movement.</p>\n<p>There are three different enemies. The evil eye which bounces off when hitting a wall, the walwoker which climbs walls when they hit and otherwise move in unpredictable ways and the killerbox which always follows the player. Each killed alien is worth 50 points and once all have been killed, a new level is started with a larger amount of enemies. The player starts with three lives and after every 10th level, the player gets a bonus life.</p>",

The player is a scuba diver who while down on the sea bed is being attacked by different sea creatures. The player moves left and right along the sea bed and has use his spear gun to shoot at the creatures above him while watching out for their projectiles. Some protection can be had from corals but these will disappear as they are hit by projectiles. There are three different sea creatures, octopi, crabs and starfish and the player gets points based on the position of each. Octopi are farthest away from the player and are therefore worth the most points. At times a shark swims across the surface and the player can get a bonus score for shooting it. The game is endless, when all creatures has been killed it all starts over with a new level until the player has lost all his lives.</p>",

There are two kinds of beakers, the object beakers that have to be filled and the master beakers that are used to do it. To do so the player controls a crane that allows him to pick up master beakers and fill them with water from a faucet which then can be emptied into the object beakers. The game is completed when all of the object beakers are full. There are two kinds of scores for the player to keep track of, number of fills and the amount of water spilled. There are two different levels of difficulty. On level 1 all object beakers are the same shape but different in size, while on level 2 they differ in both shape and size.</p>",

The player must guide Raider Rick over the surface of the asteroid, jumping over craters and avoiding flying meteorites (and aliens, in the later stages). The player starts with three lives and will lose one if Rick falls into a crater or is hit by a flying object. Rick's supply of oxygen is limited, but more oxygen can be obtained by picking up canisters that are strewn about the asteroid's surface. If Rick runs out of oxygen, the game will end. When the 20th screen is reached, a bomb must be dropped in the large crater. Once the bomb is dropped, the player has only three minutes to guide Rick back to his ship before the bomb explodes. If Rick's mission is successful, the player will earn an extra life and proceed to a more difficult asteroid. The game has nine levels of difficulty.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Cyclon</em> is a space-themed reflex game that is similar to Midway's Space Zap. The object of the game is to survive as long as possible by defending your star base from enemy star cruisers and deadly satellites. The game has 99 levels of difficulty, and the player may begin at any level from 0-10.</p>\n<p>The player's star base is located at the center of the screen and enemies firing light missiles will approach from all sides. The star base is armed with lasers that can be fired in all four directions, as well as a limited amount of anti-matter bombs which destroy all on-screen enemies. Shields can also be activated to intercept enemy shots. Firing lasers and using shields will use up energy, and if the player's energy runs out, their star base will explode. If the player does not destroy enemies or intercept their shots, their missiles will inflict damage to the player's star base. Shields will be rendered unusable on any part of the base that is hit by an enemy. The star base will be vaporized if the enemy shots penetrate the reactor at the base's core.</p>\n<p>The player starts the game with three bases and will earn an additional one each time a level is completed. Additionally, any extra energy remaining at the end of each round will be converted to extra points. When all of the player's star bases have been lost, the game is over.</p>",

They can be played through in one go, or the player can pick any of them without completing the previous ones. The enemies in each stage have their own tactics in taking out the player. In the first wave the enemies try to crash into the player, while the aliens of the second and third stage fire at the player. The player ship can only move along the bottom and shoot up against the enemies. The fourth stage is the one that differs the most from the other stages. Here the enemies follow the edges of the screen and shoot in towards the player who now can move around the screen freely. What's more, it's also possible to shoot in two directions, both up and down. The player has five lives and it's game over when they are all lost. Three different skill levels can be chosen from.</p>",

It's a racing game played from a top down perspective where the player's car automatically moves forward on a circuit consisting of four lanes and the player can increase and decrease the speed as well as switching lanes at the middle of each straight. The player's job is to collect all the dots that lie scattered around but this is made hard by the jam cars that move in the player's opposite direction and attempt to intercept. The game is over after three collisions and a level is cleared once all dots have been collected. If the player is successful with clearing two levels and has less than ten dots left on the third, the dots will turn into diamonds when the AI car runs over them. These will then be worth extra points when collected.</p>",

The player can kill the aliens by digging holes which they then might fall into. When they do so the player quickly has to fill in the hole and bury the alien. If not quick enough, the alien will rise again. Once the aliens have been killed, the player moves on to the next level, of which there are six in total.

You must make your way down to the bottom of the screen to switch off a tractor beam and then make your way back to your craft. To move down the screen you must use elevators that move up or down in gaps in the platforms but once on an elevator you can jump off. There is a patrolling robot on the surface and various Stormtroopers that move along each platform and fire lasers at you. If you touch the robot, a Stormtrooper, get shot or fall through a gap then you lose one of five lives and start back on the surface.</p>",

The player controls a ship at the bottom of the screen that can be moved left or right while shooting aliens near the top of the screen. There are four types of alien ships (blue, purple, red and yellow) each with different advance (movement) speed and worth different points. With time the gameplay speeds up gradually and ships often swoop down to the bottom of the screen, attempting to crash into the player's ship. The ship has three lives and after destroying all enemies the game is restarted with the score kept. A red marker in the bottom right corner is added for each completed wave. The game supports two players, taking turns.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Blitz</em> an airplane moves across the screen at a constant speed. When the airplane reaches the far right of the screen it moves to the left-hand side and drops down the height of one airplane. Below the airplane is a number of skyscrapers of varying heights. The player has to drop bombs from the airplane by pressing the space bar. Each bomb can destroy six floors of the skyscraper it hits. As the plane descends, the airplane can crash into any remaining blocks, so the tallest skyscrapers should be targeted first. They can only be completed by destroying every floor of every building and then landing safely on the flattened ground. </p>\n<p>The gameplay is extremely challenging, requiring excellent hand-to-eye coordination and near-perfect timing. It also offers very little margin for error and one missed opportunity will almost always end in failing a level. The game is unusual in that it requires the player to press only a single button to play - the space bar.</p>",

It takes place at Hotel Paradisio and on each of the hotel's floors the rat has to eat all pieces of cheese to be able to take the elevator to the next floor. At the same time it has to watch out for Waldo and the traps that he has placed all over the hotel. Any contact with Waldo or a trap will lead to one of three lives being lost but an extra one is granted after 10,000 points. There is a time limit too as the rat only has three minutes to move from the top to the bottom floor. The colour of the cheese changes over time and it's important to not eat it when it's black as this will paralyse the rat. However when it turns to blue it's worth double points compared to the orange one. Once the rat has eaten the big cheese in the basement the level has been completed and it will move on to a harder one. The difficulty level can also be chosen before starting the game.</p>",

Each player uses a paddle to move a bat up and down and uses it to hit a ball. They both have a set of bricks to protect and behind them there is also a pot of gold that is worth extra when hit. The player that first destroys the opponent's bricks as well as pot of gold will win the game. But to complicate things, there are also snakes that at times enter the screen. These have to be avoided since hitting them three times will lead to a game over for both players. The game has nine difficulty levels which differ in the speed of the ball as well as the snakes. The game does not have any AI opponents so it cannot be played in single player (unless the player wants to control both paddles).</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Catcha Snatch</em>, the player takes the role of the store detective Barney Bootlace. He walks around the store, which is represented with one top-down screen, to do his job: guiding lost children back to their mom, bringing lost items to the lost property office, busting shoplifters and rushing bombs out of the door. Practically this boils down to touching the item/person in question and walking to the destination. </p>\n<p>Barney's success is measured by his manager's approval from 0 to 99%. The approval rises when Barney manages to handle an issue correctly and decreases when he misses something. If 99% is reached, Barney is promoted to the next level (and a higher difficulty) - however, a demotion and a written warning follows directly after falling to 0%. After three warnings the game is over, but one warning is removed for advancing two levels.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Four Gates to Freedom</em> consists of two parts: an action game and an adventure game. The action game has to be played first and after completing it the player is given a code that is needed to start the adventure game.</p>\n<p>The game tells the story about a star cruiser that when exploring a far away planet is captured by a race of warrior ants. The crew and twenty scientists that were on board are drugged for future use as food for ants. The player's task is to destroy the four gates of the title and gain entry to the catacombs where the captives are held. </p>\n<p>The action game is a fixed screen shoot'em up where the player controls a space craft down the bottom of the screen. Above there are a red and a blue wall that protects the four gates at the top of the screen. There are four levels and in each one several of the gates have to be destroyed but first a hole has to be blown through the walls. At the same time there are various enemies that can be shot (except one which has to be avoided). To make things harder enemies that are shot send out debris in multiple directions that can also kill the player. </p>\n<p>The second game is a text adventure. The player enters directions (north, south etc.) to move around while interaction with the scenes is done by entering verbs such as go, take, use etc. Clues for the adventure game are given for each level completed in the action game.</p>",

The alien moves back and forth across the screen and the player has to follow it by moving left and right.

Like before it is a one-button game where the player has to drop bombs from planes but instead of a city there is instead a canyon full of various objects that have to be hit. This version features three different aircraft that fly at different heights and appear from both sides of the screen. Unlike previous variants, the planes do not get progressively closer to the ground and cannot crash. Instead there is a time limit of two minutes and the player's task is simply to clear as much of the canyon as possible before time runs out. The game can be played with or without gravity. The difference is that with gravity bombs will clear more objects if they are dropped from a higher altitude while without gravity there is always only one object being destroyed.</p>",

The game is played from a top down perspective and the screen consists of dots, black blocks that limit movement options and bombs that denote when the player touches them. The player's task is to move over the dots to collect the most of them and reach the exit before a timer reaches 3000. When it does the bombs will go off and the player will lose. The same happens when running into any of the bombs. The player controls an arrow that keeps moving until hitting a block or the player changes the direction. It leaves behind a blue trail when moving which turns green when moved over a second time. The player should avoid moving over it a second time since bonus points are given for each green section of the screen at the end of a level.</p>",

Munchers move horizontally towards the dam and make holes in it upon reaching it. If the hole goes all the way through the water will flood the city. Nasties appear from a mothership at the top and move downwards until reaching a building. Slideys do the same but move faster and from side to side. Bully baliffs attempt to capture the helicopter and leave with it. Additionally the player has to watch out for rain drops since the helicopter is water soluble. A life is lost every time a building is captured, the helicopter crashes or the dam floods. Three lives are available at the start.</p>",

The game takes place on the planet Plato where venomous energies called fuzz-balls have created chaos. It is up to Walter to eliminate these things by simply stepping on them.</p>\n<p>Walter starts out running on the ground and by holding the joystick button he will rise up in the air. Releasing it again will cause him to fall back towards the ground. The aim of the game is simply to make it across the levels while stepping on as many fuzz-balls as possible. The difficulty of the game comes from the various dangerous objects and rough surfaces that have to be avoided. Any contact with these will cause Walter to burst. Walter has five lives and when they are used up it's game over. There are four levels with different landscapes and obstacles.</p>",

Set in a maze inhabited by four mean ghosts, the player's gobbler has to attempt to eat the dots that are littered around the corridors while avoiding the ghosts that kill the gobbler upon contact. Four large power dots are located in the corners of the maze and by eating them the gobbler can go after and kill the ghosts for a short while. The objective is simply to eat all the dots but a level is in fact completed when only a few dots are left.</p>",

The amoebas appear on the screen in pods, each containing six of them. The player's task is to remove them by moving a laser probe over them which automatically kills them. It's necessary to be very quick about it though because with time they will start to multiply. After that has happened the amoebas cannot be removed since any contact with them will lead to instant destruction of the probe and the game will be over. Amoebas that multiply stay on the screen throughout the game making it harder for the player to move around.</p>",

Four commands can be used to interact with the environment: get, drop, open hatch, turn valve and climb. Get is used to pick up items and drop is used to remove them from the inventory since it only has space for two items. Opening a hatch requires having a crowbar in the inventory while moving in dark rooms requires a torch. Turning a valve requires a wrench and raises the submarine by 49 fathoms. To fully surface two valves have to be turned.</p>",

The premise is that Willy is returning home from the party and while walking through the park he needs to skip lightly over the ducks and catch notes of music that seem to hang in the air. It includes 33 levels of platforming where pixel perfect jumps will allow him to reach hard to reach places and avoid nasties that are after him. Platforms below can crumble and conveyor belts take him closer to his destination or doom.</p>",

The skier automatically moves down the hill and the player has to steer left and right while trying to hit as many flags as possible.

Hitting a tree will lead to death for the skier while touching an ice path will cause it to skid. After losing a skier the player gets two more attempts at completing the race.</p>",

There are four different creatures with different behaviour but all lead to death upon contact: bats, dragonflies, wasps and spiders of Mars. Bats flutter about without shooting while dragonflies leave trails of deadly dust bombs which home in on the player. The wasps appear from the right and fire stings swiftly at the player. The spiders descend from the top and spin webs that prevent the player from moving. If they reach the ground they will start firing new webs upwards. The player has three lives and gets an extra one upon reaching 10,000 points.</p>",

The player has to help a frog over a road in rush hour traffic but rather than avoiding vehicles they have to be jumped onto. The frog starts out at the bottom and has to reach the top of the screen by jumping between traffic islands, grass verges and trams that move across the screen. Falling onto the road leads to the frog instantly being killed by invisible vehicles that pass by and one out of three lives is lost. The player has one and a half minutes to reach safety and will then move on to the next road.</p>",

Both of you start out with 12 counters each and you are trying to move all your pieces to the other side of the board while capturing your opponent's pieces. You initially can go forward across the board until one of your pieces land on the other side. When it does, that piece becomes king, meaning that the piece can go forward or backward. You win the game when you have totally dominated the board.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This compilation for the VIC-20 features three games which can be played with the joystick or keyboard:</p>\n<p><strong>* Vic Trap</strong> - The game features two snakes: one controlled by you, and the other controlled by the VIC itself. The object is to make your opponent crash, while the VIC does the same thing. The two of you will leave a trail behind, making it impossible to pass through. The game will gradually speed up the longer you survive without crashing.  </p>\n<p><strong>* Sea Wolf</strong> - Not to be confused with Commodore's version, you are a submarine trying to destroy as enemy ships as it can within sixty seconds. The ships discharge mines occasionally, and these get in your way and also must be destroyed. Points vary depending on what part of the screen the ship is on. Scoring 800 points awards you with another 30 seconds of play.  </p>\n<p><strong>* Bounce Out</strong> - In this <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/arcade/breakout_\">Breakout</a></em> clone, you are trying to clear six rows of bricks at the top of the playfield. This is done by moving your bat left or right and using it to ricochet the ball either off walls or other bricks. Once the playfield is cleared, you move onto the next one. You have ten lives, so use them wisely, because the game ends when all lives are lost.</p>",

The object is to move your ship left or right, dodging invaders as they fall from the sky. A UFO will occasionally pass by, and if you don't move while it is on the screen, it will zero in on your ship and blast it. The invaders move faster as you progress through the game. Initially, the game ends when either you let an invader touch the surface or the UFO shoots you dead, but when you acquire enough shots you are given another chance.</p>",

As the player moves, they create a ditch behind them, which can be used to water portions of the field by connecting two points of a dry section together. The smaller of the two sections will always be filled. 3 bulls, who move randomly about the lines previously laid down, pose a danger to the character. A level is completed by watering the entirety of the field, and the player progresses to a new level with faster moving enemies. The goal is to achieve maximum score.

Wiping out submarines awards you with points, but the number of points you earn depends on where in the water they are. For instance, wiping out a submarine on the bottom level awards you with the most points than the one closest to you. While shooting at the submarines, you also need to protect yourself from both their harpoons and the airplane dropping bombs as it passes by, because if you come into contact with any of these you will lose one of your lives.

If done properly, one of the astronauts will then enter the LEM, and you must then take off, get through the asteroid field again (you can shoot the asteroids to make it easy), and dock with the mothership in order for the rescue to be successful. Only one astronaut can be on board, so return trips will be necessary.\nIf you miss a designated area, hit an asteroid, or fail to dock with the mothership, you lose one of your three LEMs. The game ends when you run out of these. </p>\n<p>What sets Rabbit's version from other variants of the time are the number of variations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two players can join in on the action, with both players alternating between turns.</li>\n<li>With the player's consent, the asteroids can turn into ships that fire at you while you are making your way back.</li>\n<li>Several docking methods are available, including one in which the mothership will line up with the LEM's location rather than going back and forth across the screen.</li>\n<li>The speed of the asteroids can be set, but this can be changed during the game.</li>\n<li>The mothership can automatically eject the LEM, or it can be ejected by pressing [A] on the keyboard.</li>\n<li>Up to ten sets of terrain can be chosen, or they can be randomly selected.

The object is to shoot the centipede fragment by fragment as it makes its way down toward you. Once the centipede has been wiped out, you proceed to the next wave. You must also deal with spiders and other pests that prevent you from achieving your goal, and new pests are introduced as you get further through the game. If you are attacked by centipede or pest, you will lose one of your lives. The game ends when these run out. Before the game, you can select the difficulty level which determines how fast the game runs.</p>",

The aliens have different classes, starting from the bottom row, and you score extra points if you manage to hit an alien in the top row. When you have cleared the screen of aliens, you proceed to the next wave. You initially start the game with three lives. Lose all of them and the game is over.</p>",

The object is go along the boundaries of each square to color them in without coming into contact with an enemy, but in this version of the game the \"Chaser\" is waiting for you to get close to him. Once you do, he will follow you. Be careful not to make contact or you will lose one of your lives. As usual, you can create a hole to deter him from chasing you, but only one hole can be created at a time. Once you filled all the squares, you proceed to the next grid where more Chasers are waiting for you. The game ends when you run out of lives.</p>",

First, you must drive from the fire hall across the city to the neighborhood of the burning building. Next, make your way through local traffic to reach the building itself. Finally, rescue the people jumping or falling from the building as it burns. With each completed mission, the game gets faster and more difficult, reaching its maximum after 65 missions.</p>",

Instead of static mirrors, the deflectors or bats flip as they are hit by the ball. You place deflectors in the location the ball is at the time of placement and the ball immediately changes direction. The aim is to hit 15 targets (1 to F) in the least amount of time and there are 20 difficulty levels, with the option of moving targets.</p>\n<p>In <em>ROX</em> the objective is to protect your moon base on the planet's surface in the lower center of the screen from falling meteors or \"ROX\" from space. Your base has a three way laser to defend itself and if the surface is penetrated through by the meteors, the game is lost.</p>",

There are ten levels of play, giving response times from one second to nine hours. <em>Boss</em>'s unique feature is the ability to predict its own moves. It is also capable of castling, queening, and \u2018en passant' and operates on standard chess nomenclature.</p>",

In the first screen, rocks make their way toward your ship at the top of the screen. Your ship is equipped with a laser which is used to kill aliens, fleas, and centipedes. When you kill six centipedes, you proceed to the next screen where you must prevent mutants from reaching the top of the screen. You have infinite lives here, but if you fail, you are returned to the first screen and must try again. You start the game with five lives, and a bonus life is awarded every 10,000 points. A life is lost when you are hit with any of the lifeforms, and the game is over when you run out.</p>",

Those laser beams act more like moveable walls because they don't destroy monsters, but push them back. They disappear for good when they are pushed outside the screen, but retaliation swiftly comes from the other side. The end goal is to destroy the monster queen's burrow to stop the attacks.</p>\n<p>Besides monsters, there is also a friendly creature on the screen: the monster slayer. It must be guided towards the burrow entrances with the laser beams. Then the screen changes to a side view: a big ladder which leads to eight horizontal levels. The player controls the monster slayer directly towards the lower floor and needs to plant a bomb to destroy five monster eggs while avoiding falling rocks and the monster queen which moves around the levels. After detonating the bomb on the highest floor, the next round on the surface begins. </p>\n<p>Now there are holes in the laser beams and less burrow entrances. During the side-view part, the slayer needs to move closer to the queen because five or the fifteen eggs are already destroyed. The whole sequence is repeated until no eggs are left and the queen herself is bombed. There are ten monster slayers available; a new one appears after dying underground or being pushed off the screen.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Star Defence</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Defender\">Defender</a> variant for the VIC-20, in which you commandeer a spaceship negotiating a landscape. Scattered about are aliens that threaten to abduct humanoids on the surface, and you must shoot at them with your laser fire. A humanoid is destroyed if an alien carries it to the top of the screen, you shoot at it, or it falls back down to the surface after you kill its captor. If one of them is carried off to the top of the screen, it will get destroyed and replaced by another alien that homes in on your location and tries to shoot you down.</p>\n<p>Throughout the landscape are stargates which take you to another part of it where an abduction can be witnessed. A limited supply of smart bombs can be used if the heat gets too much. Once you have killed all of the aliens, you proceed to the next wave. A radar can be activated by holding down [F3] and you can become temporarily invisible by pressing [Right Shift]. Hyperspace can be used if you press [Space]. </p>\n<p>You have a limited number of lives, and one is lost when you are hit by an alien or come into contact with their projectiles. Use all of your lives up and the game is over.</p>",

Stopping you from doing this will be four meter maids that roam around the maze. Coming into contact with any one of them results in a loss of life. When the last meter maid has left the coffee room, a parking meter will take her place. You need to hurry and put your coin in the meter before time runs out. When all the coins around the maze have been collected, the coins will be replenished.

        "description": "<p>In <em>Zorgon's Kingdom</em>, you are trying to reach the lair of the mighty Zorgon; and to do this, you need to negotiate five screens full of dangers that can be avoided or jumped over. Coming into contact with any of these dangers will result in a loss of life. (The game asks you how many lives you want before the game begins.) Run out of lives and the game ends. Depending on what screen you are on, the fire button is used to jump, dig, or shoot.</p>\n<p><strong>Screen one:</strong> Similar to <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/donkey-kong\">Donkey Kong</a></em>, reach the top of the screen while negotiating a set of ladders, avoiding the one barrel that rolls down toward you. While you are making your way to the top of the screen, the platforms will begin to collapse, so you need to finish this screen quickly. Unlike the others, this screen needs to be done twice.</p>\n<p><strong>Screen two:</strong> Your aim is to enter four elevators that go from left to right and vice versa, making sure not to fall onto the spikes. The last of these leads to a rope ladder in which you climb up to face falling aliens similar to the ones from <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/pit\">The Pit</a></em>. Get past these in a timely manner so that you can reach the boat swimming across some spikes and get to the bottom of the screen where you meet two aliens, which change their appearance occasionally and have their legs pointing up. Make contact with them in this state more than once, and you will be able to get to...</p>\n<p><strong>Screen three:</strong> After crossing two sets of electrical wires and jumping over the rockets that approach you, get past the two groups of moving pillars that move in different directions without being crushed. Once done, cross the unstable platform and climb down the final ladder.</p>\n<p><strong>Screen four:</strong> Get past the one alien ricocheting off the sides of the green tunnel, and then make your way around the rotating elevator to reach the lattice-like area and avoid the deadly alien serpent.</p>\n<p><strong>Screen five:</strong> Dig holes for the incoming Robots of Death to fall through, making it easier for you to reach the bottom of the screen. Travel down the final elevator to meet Zorgon who will attempt to get you. Shoot your laser multiple times in his direction to defeat him.</p>",

Your plane starts to descend towards the skyscrapers below and you realize you are not going to reach an airfield in time. Now it seems that the only way you and your crew are going to land safely is to flatten the city. Will you be successful? Will you be promoted?</p>\n<p>A plane flies across a single-screen city at a steady pace. When it reaches the edge of the screen, it wraps to the other side at a lower altitude. The player drops bombs from the plane, with only 1 bomb on the screen at a time. Each bomb removes one building if it hits. As the plane descends, it risks colliding with remaining buildings. The level is complete when all buildings are destroyed. The player receives a higher rank with each city destroyed.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Chicken Challenge</em> is a clone of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Frogger\">Frogger</a>, in which you control a chicken trying to get into its five homes across a river. However, your task is made difficult by enemies such as cars and ducks, not to mention the fox that suddenly appears in a home. You need to get to a home as soon as possible as you have a time limit, but getting to a home before time expires will reset it. You can get the egg that appears for bonus points. You have six chickens to play with, and one is lost when either time runs out before you reach a home or you touch an enemy. Lose all of them and the game is over.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Dam Busta</em>, you control a scuba-diver armed with a harpoon, and your task is to blow up a dam. To do so, you need to get through two screens full of enemies that try to stop you from doing this. On the first screen, make your way to the entrance near the bottom-right, avoiding a swarm of barracuda that moves left and right in the water. In the second screen, kill the guardians who fire at you until you get a clear shot of a rocket. You are running out of air, and need to replenish your supply by swimming up to the surface, but a helicopter will stop you from doing this by dropping a depth-charge at you. If you manage to shoot the rocket, the guardians will be disabled, allowing you to place a bomb at the base of the dam. You must then return to the spot where you started and the bomb will be detonated. Do this three times and the dam will be destroyed. If you run out of air or get hit either a depth-charge or a guardian projectile, you lose a life and restart from screen one. Run out of lives and the game ends.</p>",

Both of these are found in passages accessible by lifts. You can carry up to two sacks of gold at a time. If you decide to carry a treasure chest, remember that this will be too much for the lifts and you have to take a different route up to the top. The game sets a target score; if you manage to reach this before time is up, you proceed to the next mine. The first mine shaft you enter may be easy with no enemies, but later ones introduce enemies and obstacles such as monsters and falling rocks. Any contact with these will result in a loss of life (not shown in the game). Running out of time or getting crushed by a lift will also result in a loss of life.</p>",

In the second stage, the player must destroy the alien mothership before it reaches the bottom of the screen by shooting out pieces of the ship and hitting the aliens inside the ship. When all aliens are hit, the ship explodes. In the final level, the player can only dodge, and must avoid all incoming asteroids. The player starts with 3 lives, and each level becomes progressively faster.</p>",

As these rocks melt, ice monsters hatch from them and track you down. Your only defense is to push a block of ice rock, sending it crashing into the monsters. The monsters can also push and break through ice rocks, and ice rocks can be destroyed by hitting them against another rock or against the side of the labyrinth. </p>\n<p>The vehicle has limited fuel, and a buzzer will ring when the machine is low. The truck can be refueled by crushing a diamond ore rock. The player has a total of 3 lives, and there are always 2 enemies per stage. There are 8 levels of difficulty.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Cannibal</em> is a 1-player arcade game for the VIC-20.</p>\n<p>The player controls a character that tries to consume all of the dots in a maze. The maze is divided into 2 sections, a top section that is an open feel with a red skull that chases the player, and a bottom maze-like section that contains randomly moving cannibals. As the player moves between sections, the enemies only move if the player is in that area. Crosses in the maze-like section make the cannibals temporarily vulnerable, and bonus items can also appear in that area. The player starts with 5 lives, and the goal is to eat all dots to advance to a more difficult identical level.</p>",

Amid the noise and dust, the four teams of Red, White, Green, and Blue, thunder around the course in a perilous bid for fame and fortune. </p>\n<p>Each player controls a chariot that can accelerate, decelerate, or move left and right. Each player is awarded points for how fast and far they travel. Other chariots block the track, and these can be pushed sideways into barricades at the edges. The player's chariot can be destroyed by running into the back of another chariot or into the barricades at the edge of the screen. If the player travels too slowly, fireballs begin to rain down onto the track.</p>",

Players choose which craft, and which of 8 directions, to move. The craft will move in that direction until it reaches the edge of the grid gathering all tokens along the way. If the player makes a move that does not align with tokens, the game is over. That player will lose their points for the round, while the other 3 players will hold onto their points for the next round.</p>\n<p>Brainstorm: The Psions are friendly enough to Terrans, but their telepathic emissions are dangerous to the human brain. So, humans must never be in the vicinity of a greater number of Psions. The goal is to transport 3 Terrans and 3 Psions across a river using a single raft. If there are ever more Psions than Terrans on the side of the river, then it's game over. All Terrans can row the boat, but only one of the Psions is strong enough. The boat can only hold 1 Psion and 1 Terran at a time. The goal is to get all 6 across the river without a deadly brainstorm.</p>",

Enterprise, and warps between quadrants trying to destroy all the Klingon vessels. Each game has a set time limit and a difficulty of 1 - 9. Hyperspace can be engaged to warp to different sectors. The player can fire torpedoes or use their phasers. For each attack the player must specify direction of fire. The ship's computer assists with navigation, tracks previously explored sectors, and can be used to evaluate ship status. The ship has limited energy, which can be use to power shields or the phasers. The ship can take damage and enact repairs, as well as visit star bases for repairs and recharges.</p>",

The distance until contact is displayed at the top of the screen. As the riders approach, the opponents appear larger in the displays at bottom of the screen. The player controls their lance, represented by a target on the opponent's screen, while the opponent tracks them with their shield. The goal is to reposition the target to an undefended part of their opponent's body at the time of contact, scoring higher points for a better hit. The computer also scores points for hits on the player. At higher levels the lance target becomes less responsive. The first player to reach 100 points is the victor. The player receives a Vile Varlet score for the number of opponents defeated in a row.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Space Snake</em> is a 1-player arcade game for the VIC-20.</p>\n<p>After the first colonial ships arrived at the edge of the first galaxy, people on Earth received news of ships disappearing forever. So the \"Mastercontrol\" sent out a body of scouts to investigate the matter. Soon they received the message, that this part of the galaxy was covered with swarms of meteorites and spacebirds. Some of them just floated, but others moved at a very high speed. Androids were programmed to discover a safe route through this ferocious field. But the task was far too difficult. One ship after another exploded almost immediately and some after a few minutes. No one was able to reach the final gateway on the planet Clusio, which would bring the fleet into a new galaxy. In despair, \"Mastercontrol\" asked the entire nation for help. They looked for volunteers, who could discover a safe passage to guide the national fleet into the galaxy beyond. </p>\n<p>To make this task easier a very sophisticated Space Snake was developed. A quick maneuverable machine, which could dive into this treacherous space and outwit its dangerous entities. You could become this hero, if you are able to find a safe passage for the entire fleet. </p>\n<p>The player controls a snake that moves laterally, and must wind their way through a field of rapidly moving dangers. Dangers approach faster as the game progresses, and it's game over if the player hits an object.</p>",

Only three defender bees stand between an onslaught of the dreaded munchers and the royal honey.</p>\n<p>The player controls the bee at the bottom of the screen that can move laterally and fire vertically. Large munchers zigzag to the bottom of the screen, and the player tries to shoot them with their stinger before they reach the bottom. When a muncher reaches the bottom of the screen, a part of the royal honey's guard barrier is destroyed. If a muncher reaches the honey horde it's game over. The player loses a life if hit by a muncher, and starts with 3 lives.</p>",

Your mission is to blast the remote control high power bombs which are being planted by the Martian Overlord's personal attack force just in case the negotiations break down. If they break down the Overlord will blast Venus to atoms after he has reached a safe distance from the planet. You must not shoot the Martians unless you have no choice. </p>\n<p>The player can move in 8 directions on a maze with the goal to clear all bombs. Each time that the player shoots three Martians they get more frantic and lay the bombs faster. All bombs are replaced on the screen when this happens. The player can use hyperspace when surrounded by Martians to warp to a new area. It's game over if the player is hit by a Martian.</p>",

Only a single slow moving shot appears on the screen at a time. Ants move laterally across the screen until they hit an obstacle, and then move down 1 row and reverse direction. When an ant is hit it's trapped, leaving a mark on the screen. If this mark is again hit, the ant escapes and starts moving again. Obstacles randomly appear on the screen blocking the player's shots. The player completes a level if all 10 ants are trapped before an ant reaches the bottom row. It's game over if an ant reaches the bottom.</p>",

But, the Eagle of the North is on hand to rescue Prince Rupert, and take him to safety of his aerie.</p>\n<p>The player controls a large bird that flaps to gain altitude and moves laterally. Fire bombs fall from the top of the screen and then roll along the platforms on the screen. If the bombs strike the bottom center platform they explode into a temporary fire pit. The player tries to pick up Prince Rupert from the screen and bring him to the aerie at the top left of the screen. The player must avoid fire bombs, The Baron's airplane, and the fire pit, and it's game over with a single hit.</p>",

The computer team pitches the ball, and the player must time their swing to hit it into the field between the bases. If the batter misses 3 times, they're out. The batter, after hitting the ball into the field, tries to run as many of the 5 bases as possible. The two outfielders must catch the ball and pass it to the pitcher who then tries to tag the runners. If a runner stops beside a flag they are safe, and can only be tagged out between bases. Any runner who is tagged is out for the remainder of the game making it more difficult to score further runs. Game play continues until all three batters are tagged out, and the player receives their final score.</p>",

You've recently qualified as the youngest bridge builder in the country; and have just won your first major contract. The boss of a multi-national construction company has sub-contracted you to build a bridge for his latest project. The contract you signed was pretty strict, in fact, the penalty clause was absolutely frightening; if the bridge isn't completed on time you will be bankrupt, and that's no way to start off in business. On the other hand if everything goes according to plan your future is secure. </p>\n<p>Yesterday, your supplier phoned to tell you that due to a nationwide shortage of materials the final delivery of sections will be delayed until tomorrow. The trouble is your time limit runs out this afternoon. You have six gaps in the bridge, and only one spare section. Here comes the Boss to inspect the bridge. Can you juggle the single section around quickly enough so that he won't notice the gaps?</p>\n<p>The player selects 6 buttons to temporarily fill 1 of 6 gaps. The gaps are divided over 3 levels, and the boss will randomly try to walk across a platform from the right of the screen. The player must fill the correct gap before the boss walks across, or else he falls off the bridge. Each time the boss crosses he walks faster the next time. If the boss falls 3 times, it's game over.</p>",

Depending on the color the player lands on, they can either roll again to move forwards or backwards, miss a turn, acquire a strength scroll, encounter a magic bridge, or encounter an enemy. Combat is random, and the player can opt to use a shield, and if defeated moves to the start of the board. At a magic bridge the player can choose to cross which leads to combat. If the player succeeds at a bridge combat they move far ahead. Victory in random combat gives the player another roll.</p>",

Their explosions reverbating amidst the cries of the wounded. The dusty smell of gun-fire is in the air, and smoke fills the skies, obliterating the war planes diving down to strafe the infantry. Communications have been severed, and you must deliver strategic plans from one command post to another, dodging snipers and machine gunners. </p>\n<p>The game play area contains a 9 x 9 grid of trees. A cannon at the left of the screen continuously scrolls from the top to the bottom of the screen, and if the cannon aligns with the player, it will destroy them. The player can hide behind trees to avoid death. When all packages are delivered a new set of letters appears and the cannon speeds up. The player starts with 3 lives and receives a bonus man every 5000 points.</p>",

The player attempts to gather all the keys outside the cell while avoiding the opponent character. The doors to the cell temporarily open, and the player must exit through these to grab items, and then return to the cell before being either captured by their opponent or the walls of the jail close again leaving them trapped outside. The opponent rapidly chases the player, but will not enter the cell. After the keys are acquired, the player tries to safely navigate to the doors on the level to move to the next challenge.</p>",

The player controls a U.F.O. that can move in all directions and fires vertically downwards. Enemy planes approach from the left, and the player tries to shoot them without being hit. If the ship is moving the enemies are more likely to return fire. Every shot temporarily heats the vehicle, and if the ship overheats it can't fire for some time.

Enemy forces steadily climb up the screen, and the player must blast them before they reach their goal. Three deadly laser beams positioned at the edges of the screen set up a crossfire, and the player loses a life if caught in the crossfire. Neutron torpedo launchers appear at the edge of the screen and fire on the player. The player also loses a life if they receive 10 collisions or torpedo hits. The player starts with 5 ships.</p>",

The player tries to navigate between flags to reach the end of the hill. There is a time penalty for each flag missed. There are 3 race types: slalom, giant slalom, and downhill. Downhill has a constant path of flags, while slalom and giant slalom have rare flags. If the player hits a tree or bump their run is over. There are 9 levels of difficulty for each run.</p>",

Enemy ships can be destroyed by hitting them from above, but player ships can be destroyed the same way. Destroyed alien ships become escape pods which fall to the ground, and can be picked up for bonus points. The player must watch for the lava at the bottom of the screen, and faces a new wave of enemies when the screen is cleared.</p>",

As commander of the emergency force dispatched to the area, you must guard the scientists by patrolling each quadrant of the planet and destroying the attack waves of alien ships. </p>\n<p>Sixteen scientists run about the bottom of the screen. Thirty two enemy ships appear from a distance, and when they get close, if they appear above a scientist, they will use a tractor beam to abduct the researcher. The player controls a crosshair that will destroy enemy ships if moved over the alien vessel. Gameplay occurs on a horizontally scrolling screen which incorporates 4 quadrants, and the location of scientists and enemy vessels are displayed. If the crosshair moves over a red deflector shield the player can not attack for several seconds. A level is cleared if all alien vessels are destroyed before all scientists are lost.

Footmen move similar to the pawns of chess, and can move 1 square forwards or 2 squares on their first move. They can take opponents on an angle. If they reach the far row they become a horseman, or if the player already has 2 horsemen, get a free move to anywhere on the board. Horsemen move like the knights in chess. Moves occur simultaneously, and 2 pieces of equal value are removed if they land on the same square. Otherwise, a horseman will remove a footman. The first player to take their opponent's footmen is the winner. There are 3 computer skill levels.</p>",

As the commander of a fleet of destroyers, your job is to go along a horizontally-scrolling landscape and prevent this from happening. To make sure you don't succeed in your mission, they will release an army of followers, including Androids, Super-Androids, Spidercrafts, and Magnetrons. Each one of these aliens have their own attack pattern, and are gradually introduced throughout the game's five levels. A small radar is provided at the top of the screen to keep track of the aliens.

Each battle zone is patrolled by 1 or 2 nuclear tanks. Their mission is to search out and destroy the aliens which invade their battle zone.</p>\n<p>Each battle zone is a 22 x 22 grid enclosed by a boundary. The tank can rotate left and right, move or fire forwards, and can lay mines. The tank has limited energy, and may recharge by picking up energy cells if their energy is less than 40. The player must avoid atomic mines, craters, trees, and mountains. Points are awarded by destroying spiders and space eyes. Space eyes are created when spiders enter a square containing an energy cell.</p>",

These pads become smaller with each use.

You as the player can use impulse or warp engines to move by providing the angle from 0 - 360 degrees and the power. The player is armed with a limited number of deadly torpedoes, and also phaser weapons which use up the overall ship energy. Hits from Klingon vessels can further reduce ship energy. Ship energy and torpedoes can be replenished at star bases. Activities cost time, and the goal is to end the Klingon menace at the lowest star date.</p>",

The goal is to earn points by shooting aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen. The aliens march back and forth, and each time they reach the edge of the screen they will drop one row closer to the bottom. Aliens intermittently return fire. Shoot them all to move to the next harder level. If any aliens reach the bottom of the screen it's game over. A flying saucer intermittently moves across the top of the screen for bonus points. Three shields offer protection from alien fire, but also block the player's shots. The player begins with 3 cannons.</p>",

He always seems to be able to keep up with you, however fast you run.  He's making a life of crime sheer hard work.</p>\n<p>To escape P. C. Plod, the player must rapidly move their joystick left and right.  The player can also jump, throw vacuums, or throw diamonds.  At the start of each job, the player has a training session where they have 3 attempts to complete a 200 yard dash in the displayed time frame.  This section can be skipped if deemed too difficult.  During the actual theft, the player must stay ahead of P. C. Plod for 1000 yards.  While doing this, they must jump over or use their vacuum on objects to clear their path.  If the player hits an obstacle or is caught by P. C. Plod, they lose a life.  </p>\n<p>The player can jump to grab treasure.  If they jump and grab a bomb, they are temporarily filled with adrenaline and can run faster and jump higher.  If the player accidentally grabs an alarm bell, surveillance floaters known as Big Eyes appear.  These can be removed by throwing diamonds.  Master Big Eyes resistant to diamonds appear after level 10.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Whirlwind One Five</em> is a 1-player arcade game for the VIC-20.</p>\n<p>Vital equipment is needed by your allies in order to stop the enemy missiles that are continually attacking your base. This equipment has to be loaded onto your helicopter in daylight and dropped over a target area. Game play is divided into 3 phases.</p>\n<p>In Phase 1, the player must take off and defend their fuel lines from enemy missiles. The player takes off from the landing pad, and can move in the cardinal directions to shoot down incoming missiles from the left. Each missile that passes by the player costs 20 fuel. If the player is hit by a missile it's game over.</p>\n<p>In Phase 2, the enemy begins to drop parachute mines directly onto your supply lines. The player controls a gun that moves laterally at the bottom of the screen. You must protect your helicopter's fueling by shooting the incoming mines. Each missed mine costs 5 fuel, and if all fuel is lost or the gun is hit by a mine it's game over.</p>\n<p>In Phase 3, the player must successfully make the cargo drop with their helicopter while defending from enemy missiles, and return safely to base.</p>",

Each detective can have 200, 400, 600, or 800 action points to solve the mystery. Every question asked of witnesses costs 2 points. The detectives take turns interviewing the 11 remaining guests, and can ask where they were at a specific time, who they saw at that time, what weapons they may have seen, and ask about what motives different characters may have had for murder. When the player thinks they know the culprit they can try to solve the crime and come up with a guilty or innocent verdict.</p>",

You are each armed with 2 proton missiles and 4 neutron shells which are self-energized, and can be used for long-range attacks. The player is also armed with short-range offensive weapon, including plasma bolts, laser cannons, and disruptor beams. These use energy from the starting power source.</p>\n<p>When the player receives attack from the enemy, they must set a shield level from 0 - 9. If the attack penetrates the shield, a secondary shield activates to absorb the blow, but this shield uses considerable energy. When the player runs out of energy they will receive a fatal blow. The player and computer take turns firing in combat, while the enemy fires and approaches the player. Battle occurs until one player runs out of energy and is destroyed.</p>",

Well, it's said to be filled by a lone leprechaun who after the sun has set can change all the rain drops he catches into coins of gold. Well, it's almost dark, and they forecast rain.</p>\n<p>The player controls the leprechaun with a wheelbarrow, and moves laterally at the bottom of the screen. Coins fall from the sky, and the goal is to position the wheelbarrow to catch each coin. Each coin gains a point, but each missed coin costs a point. If the player drops below 0 it's game over. Every 15 coins caught causes the rate of coin fall to increase. The final score is based upon the number of caught coins.</p>",

The player's ship can move in the cardinal directions, and has limited fuel to blast the green aliens that appear. Green aliens move to a new location on the field every few seconds, so must be destroyed quickly. The player must shoot or avoid the purple enemies that appear. The player starts with 500 fuel, and fuel rapidly depletes. The player restores 100 fuel every several green enemies shot. There are 9 levels of starting difficulty, which control fuel depletion and how long an enemy stays in one place.</p>\n<p>The game ends when the player hits 3 enemies or runs out of fuel.</p>",

Game play consists of numerous arcade segments, riddles, math puzzles, and exploring a large island.</p>\n<p>The game starts with a balloon descent, where the player must try to gather energy modules and land on the small island at the bottom of the screen while avoiding dangerous birds and crashing into the ocean below. Any mistake leads to death and game over.</p>\n<p>After arriving on the island, the player can move about and search for treasures. Each treasure chest presents the player with a math problem, where they must input the 5th digit in a sequence. Items and coins are awarded with successful completion of a puzzle. Some treasure chests contain a word puzzle which must be solved to receive the treasure. If the player is incorrect on the number sequence or the word puzzle, they're sent to The Hive, which is a series of dark tunnels that must be escaped to reach the exit. </p>\n<p>While exploring the island, the player is engaged by giant crabs. In this arcade sequence, the player must reach the exit point while avoiding all of the slow moving crabs that move towards the player. </p>\n<p>The player has limited energy, and when this runs low they enter an arcade sequence where they try to catch energy drops in a moving cup as it floats by at the top of the screen. The player dies if they fail to keep adequate energy. When entering caves, the player enters an arcade sequence of a mosaic floor where they try to find clues hidden under tiles. </p>\n<p>The ultimate goal is to find the Nautilus and escape from the island. For this, the player must move through a maze of moving laser beams, and then answer a number of questions about the vessel. Finally, they can escape from the island via a series of tight passageways.</p>",

If the omnitron drone contacts a crystal it electrifies the playing field, killing the player. If the player contacts a drone or a green nuclear explosive device, they also lose a life. These nuclear devices continue to appear on the screen, and the player must survive 45 seconds to advance to the next stage. If the player stays in one place too long, the omnitron sentinel appears, which chases the player and is very difficult to avoid. Each level has more or faster moving drones, and the player starts with 3 lives.</p>",

The hero, though mortally wounded, shouted a final cry of victory: \u201cHark! The Evil Wizard and his Eternal Orb no longer hold dominion over this land\u201d.</p>\n<p>And now, bandits, orcs, highwaymen and all sorts of vile creatures have gotten bolder. Where they roamed before as mere nuisance, they now dare more often, and even well armed escorts are no longer safe from their attacks. They wander from their wilderness and abandoned ruins of the Land of Rivar to threaten cities within its borders. Sanctuary can no longer be guaranteed. Even dragons have begun to appear, reducing whole villages to ash.</p>\n<p>The King sent forth his finest on a scouting mission to the old ruins of Nikaedor's lair; warriors of unyielding strength and magic wielders of cunning sorcery. After the passing of several moons, their bodies floated in the moat of his great castle. A journal was retrieved from their watery grave. The final entry petrified those with ears to hear it, \u201cNikaedor has returned. Death to those who fail to pay tribute on this day and forever. Hail Nikaedor!\u201d</p>\n<p>The player creates a party of 6 characters in the village surrounding the King's castle. Each character randomly roles 6 attributes: strength, dexterity, intelligence, constitution, wisdom, and charisma, and can pick from 8 races, which allows the character to choose a class. Items and armour can be purchased at the local weapon shop, injured characters healed at the inn, and deceased characters resurrected at the temple. </p>\n<p>The player can then explore the overland by foot or purchase a boat to sail the seas. As the party explores the land they also encounter enemy parties. The party can choose to fight, run from, or greet the enemies they meet, and if engaged in combat, each character chooses to fight or cast spells. Enemies are graphically displayed on the screen.</p>\n<p>When entering dungeons, game play changes to a first person perspective, where the player must exploring twisting passageways and doors to gather treasure and items.</p>",

There are 6 floors with 6 flats on each. Not all tenants have the pools and few tenants have the right money. The pools have to be in by Saturday morning, so you have one hour to visit every flat. The player can take the elevator to the 6 separate floors, and individually visits doors. The player has a number of \u00a350, 20, 10, 5, 2, and 1 notes, and must give appropriate change for those who don't have the right money.</p>",

The smallest area contained by each shape is filled in when a shape is connected at two points to existing territory.  While claiming territory, the player needs to watch out for enemies which follow pre-existing lines, and actively chase the player if close.  A level is completed by gaining all territory on the screen, dividing the remaining areas into smaller and smaller components.

The player's only defence is their ability to run.  The player's goal is to reach the end of the space warp at the top of the screen.  </p>\n<p>The player can move left, right, and forwards.  They cannot move backwards as they would fall down a black hole.  The player cannot make contact with the edge of the screen or the Space Mobiles which move laterally across the screen.  Danger lanes are located below the two lanes that contain a single space, and if the player stays too long in this lane they are shot by lasers.  The player is awarded points for moving forwards, and receives a bonus upon reaching the top of the screen, and restarts the level.  A free Space Frog is awarded every 5000 points.</p>",

After reaching a bomb, a new bomb appears on a random free square on the screen, including areas that may be impossible to reach.  Immobile dangers on the screen further increase danger.  The player starts with 5 lives, gains one 1 point for each bomb defused, and loses a life if they touch a previously used square or a danger.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Deep underground lies a vast labyrinth made by people long gone. They faded away, leaving behind their gold in their former domain, nowadays inhabited by denizens such as dragons, orcs, vampires and such. Your role is an adventurer attempting to explore the uncharted depths and escape with your life -and as much treasure as you can grab.\nThis game is a quasi-RPG that involves maze exploration and turn based battles. You control a single unnamed character and at your disposal you have a generic melee attack and a generic offensive magic spell to dispatch nasties. At any given time you can invoke a statistics screen to check your strength and agility points, both of which are depleted as you move and fight your way in the levels. The maze itself spans numerous floors, connected by staircases and one-way pits. As you progress to lower depths, the game pits you against tougher enemies. The game ends if you return to the surface the same way you entered, with all the loot you managed to grab - or if you perish. \n<em>Quest 26</em> is written in BASIC and was published as a type-in program in the British Magazine \"Your Computer\" in August 1983.</p>",

Microchine fighters have recently jumped into the quadrants, and have reprogrammed several exploration ships, such that they travelled to their own doom.  The player controls the ship <em>Skye's Limited II</em>, and must end the Microchine danger.</p>\n<p>Played on a 10 x 10 grid, the player can hyperspace to different areas.  Some of these may contain asteroid fields, and the player must dodge these from a top-down perspective by moving left and right.  If the player enters a quadrant with enemy ships, they try to line up a crosshair to destroy the enemy vessels from a 1st-person perspective. The ship has limited fuel, and each jump and battle reduces this.  The player refuels at fuel bases, and the player must navigate a treacherous cavern system from a top-down perspective.  There are four levels of difficulty.</p>",
