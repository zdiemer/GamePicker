        "description": "<p><em>Time Trap</em> is a rather typical British flick-screen platformer of the old school, similar to <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/57920/roland-in-time/\">Roland in Time</a></em> (from the same developers) or <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/63114/dynamite-dan/\">Dynamite Dan</a></em>. Given a generous ten lives, you guide a character named Z.Z. Brainhead (\"Zed Zed\" to his friends) from screen to screen, each representing a stage in the earth's past, and each infested with strange nasties, to pick up crystals. You must avoid the moving baddies, as well as environmental dangers such as skulls which kill on contact or platforms which fall down when tread upon. The game contains over fifty screens to be explored, and over 100 crystals must be collected so that Z.Z. can power his spaceship and return home.</p>",

This time around, though, the game is actually scrolling instead of using a flick-screen mechanism. Using a gate on each planet, Zed may travel at leisure between them. Just as there is a myriad of parts to pick up, there is a myriad of enemies moving around on-screen and loads of challenging leaps to be made, making this possibly even more difficult than its predecessor.</p>",

Hence, Pakman and the ghosts are reduced to a size of only 8 by 8 pixels, as are the tunnels of the labyrinth, lending the game a feeling quite unlike that of its source of inspiration.</p>\n<p><em>Millipede</em> features the same kind of involved game mechanics as the Atari original, with a speeding centipede that turns whenever it collides with a mushroom, and which splits into two when shot in the gut. Additional characters in the game is the spider, the fleas that plant more mushrooms, and the snail that poisons them. This game, too, uses 8x8 character graphics.</p>",
