Not only does he has to watch out for being run over by the heavy traffic but also the vicious dogs who wants nothing more than to bite him. Now it's up to the player to help him out. The game is played from a top down perspective of a block. In the middle there is a heavily trafficked road with three houses on each side. The aim of the game is simply to deliver as much mail as possible within three lives. Each letter has a colour and has to be delivered to the house with the same colour. Once a letter has been delivered the player returns to the post office for another one. There are two routes to each house, the main street or the back alleys. On the street the player has to avoid the cars and in the back alleys the dogs have to be avoided. Otherwise a life is lost. The player earns points for each delivered letter and for every five letters the value goes up. Delivering to the front door is worth more than delivering to the back door.</p>",
