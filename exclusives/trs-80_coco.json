        "description": "<p><em>Dungeons of Daggorath</em> is a dungeon crawler which has rudimentary magic, character building, and combat elements, like a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Wizardry\">Wizardry</a>-style RPG, while also using a text parser like a graphic adventure. The top part of the screen is dominated by a first-person view of the dungeon, while the player enters his/her commands at the bottom. Verb recognition includes commands such as MOVE, TURN, USE, ATTACK, STOW, and INCANT. </p>\n<p>The game contains five levels of dungeon to explore, and more and more powerful monsters the deeper the player character advances. Some monsters of the same type get stronger as well - for example, the troll starts on level one armed with a club, but on later levels he gets more powerful with an axe. Other features include different levels of torches that affect viewing distance and eventually wear out; monsters generating different sounds that grow louder or fainter as they get closer to the protagonist (even if they cannot be seen behind walls); and the real-time aspect of the heartbeat. If the player character is injured or running too fast, his heart rate increases, and he may pass out if the player pushes too far. During that time, monsters would keep moving and attacking.</p>",

        "description": "<p>An original game, <em>Panic Button</em> involved one working on a multi-level manufacturing line, trying to keep up orders by assembling various products. The parts drop out of 3 chutes on the top left of the playfield, and you can run all over the place to pick up the 3 different parts of the product, and you have to assemble them in order (for example, a robot must have it's feet on the bottom, torso in the middle, and head on the top). The pieces come out of the first conveyor belt in random order, and you can only carry one piece at a time. If you accidentally assemble a product in the wrong order, it becomes useless, so you have to be careful where you drop the pieces. There is also a Panic Button (hence the game name) in the upper right corner that you can hit that stops the conveyor belts temporarily.</p>\n<p>For each level, you have to make a specific amount of the product you are creating within a time limit of 2 minutes, and each successive level gets faster and faster (and you also have to build more and more). Also, since the 3 conveyor belts are staggered, and pieces will drop on their own between them, you have to be careful watching them as they get near a drop point, as they could fall on pieces you have already constructed and potentially screw that particular product up. On later levels, the bad products start bouncing around as well, interfering with your manoeuvring.</p>",

In this game, there are popcorn kernels in rows at the top of the screen, and you start with 6 levels of frying pans at the bottom. As the kernels start to fall, you have to catch them before they hit the conveyor belt at the very bottom of the screen. Each time a kernel makes it all the way to the bottom, you lose a frying pan, until you have none left. The higher the level you get into the game, the faster the popcorn falls, and more kernels will fall at once.</p>",

This game was released twice (with some slight changes), once when sold by Game Point Software, and then directly by SRB Software after Game Point folded a short time after.</p>\n<p>The basic play of <em>Z-89</em> focuses on the objective to destroy the Zaxxon robot at the end of the two floating space fortresses, while defending yourself from planes, tanks, missiles, and colliding with terrain. You have to keep your fuel topped up as well, by shooting fuel tanks. The game is played in isometric 3D, showing you flying at an angle, where you can fly side to side and up and down (you are always moving forward). <em>Z-89</em> adds one new twist to <em>Zaxxon</em>: in the space sequence (between the two floating space fortresses), in addition to planes coming after you, you also have meteors to contend with.</p>",

As in <em>Lode Runner</em>, your mission is to steal all of the gold bars, while avoiding the guards, and escape up to the next level after you have gotten them all. Guards can pick up to 1 Gold bar themselves, and the only way to get them back is to dig a self filling hole in the ground (on ground that you can actually dig in) early enough that it kills the guard. If you dig it to late, the guard will crawl out on his own (something you can not do if you get in the same situation). The game takes on strategy and maze play as well, as some of the gold bars are buried inside walls that you have to dig through to get to them.</p>",

        "description": "<p>\"They're here!\"  This game is based on Tobe Hooper's popular 1982 horror movie where the Freeling family occupy a haunted suburban home and their daughter Carol-Anne is abducted by ghosts through the television set.  There's three levels of ever-increasing difficulty on your quest to rescue Carol-Anne.</p>\n<p>The first level is a top-down view of the neighbourhood where you must search nearby homes for these items: a length of rope, a ribbon, a towel, some tennis balls, and a handkerchief.  A black dot on a house indicates where they are and you only have a limited 30 time units to accomplish this.  You must avoid speeding cars on the streets by ducking into driveways and avoid the poltergeist who will randomly go from house to house (seen as a flashing box).  Once all the items are acquired, you enter the house where the poltergeist lives.  </p>\n<p>In the second level, you are shown a view of a stairway going upward and on each step there are barriers moving horizontally - squares and ovals with X's through them. You (as a pair of shoe prints) must move up or down, left or right, to avoid all obstacles until you reach the top where the steps get narrower and more difficult.  Meanwhile a poltergeist will also be chasing you up the stairs so you must be quick before the 30 time units are up.</p>\n<p>In the third and final level, you enter the closet and from a first-person view must shoot a firearm and hit 8 poltergeists but beware as Carol-Anne is also there and if you hit her, you will go all the way back to the first level again.  If you manage to complete it, you will receive the message, \"This house is clean\".</p>",

The Terran Federation is locked in a deadly war with \"the Bugs,\" and has announced \"Operation Bughouse,\" an attack directly on the Bugs' home world of Klendathu. Equipped with a state-of-the-art power suit, you drop in from orbit and torch as many Bug warriors as possible, then bounce back out before your suit runs out of energy or the Bugs overwhelm you. Survive three drops and you can retire, with pay based on how many Bugs of each rank you blasted.</p>\n<p>Game play consists of carefully selecting which block of the drop zone to land in, and then blasting the warrior and queen Bugs as they advance down the screen toward you. For each warrior and queen you might see, however, there are many more harmless worker Bugs, which look exactly like the warriors. They're all swarming toward you; choose your targets carefully and don't waste your ammo. You'll know the warriors because they're the ones shooting at you.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Lord Scylla, ruler of six galaxies, has declared eminent domain over ours.  Zycon, the commandant of Scylla's Imperial Fleet, has already conquered or annihilated all human outposts and colonies, and recommends immediate surrender, tribute, and the submission of some representatives as laboratory specimens.</p>\n<p>Standing in Zycon's way is your fast, deadly ship and skills as a pilot.  This ROM cartridge game puts a joystick in each of your hands, and an Ion engine, hyper-drive, and twin Masor cannons at your command.  The game screen provides a view looking forward out of your craft, two Short Range Sensors showing incoming enemies ahead and behind you, and a power meter.  Each hit by an enemy blast reduces your power and briefly scrambles your view.  Four levels of play culminate in a campaign where you jump from sector to sector eradicating enemy ships in dogfights with up to four opponents. A Long Range Sensor screen shows the status of your ship's various systems, how many enemies are in each sector, and where to find space stations.  To be recharged and repaired, you carefully maneuver your ship to the correct position and speed to receive a power pack from the space station.</p>",

Collect the gold that was stolen from you, dodge laser pellets shot by the monsters, and blast a few of them in return.</p>\n<p>In this ROM cartridge game you maneuver a figure through simple \"mazes,\" exiting by a doorway on any of the sides you did not start on, which puts you in another such maze and gives you another \"man.\"  On the way, you must out-maneuver monsters who become increasingly aggressive with each maze and shortly start shooting at you. You can maneuver the monsters into walls or each other, or just shoot them.  Grabbing the treasure will help your score along, too.  The game does not actually offer escape from the maze; the best you can hope for is vengeance and a high score.</p>\n<p>At first glance your perspective is top-down, looking down at the walls of the maze, but your man, the monsters, and the treasure, are all shown from the side.</p>",

        "description": "<p>As a merchant in the distant future, you captain a starship from system to system, visiting starports to buy and sell cargo until you amass one thousand credits and retire to the quiet life.  Fuel, upkeep, and even computer access contribute to overhead expenses.  Pirates will get in your way and do costly damage to your ship or even end your career if your aim is slow.  When money runs short, however, you can always scoop fuel from a red giant star or swipe some cargo from the ship a few bays down.  If you make your deliveries on time, your reputation will bring you better fees.</p>\n<p>The emphasis of the game is economic; ship-to-ship combat is purely a gallery shoot with moving targets and a possibility of escape.  All play is real-time, so even in the starport, your fuel is being used and delivery dates are getting closer.  Care must be taken in selecting cargo, as some runs will lose you money for the amount of fuel they consume.  Run out of fuel in mid-jump and you're space salvage.  Everything happens on one, tripartite game screen showing the view outside your ship, your status (cash, fuel, repair, date, etc.), and the graphical menu below.</p>",

The player rides the white winged horse Pegasus from Greek mythology. Players must approach the Phantom Riders just above, so that Pegasus can use his hooves to destroy them. They will fall from the sky and, if they land on the ground below, a cross grave marker will appear. If players leave the grave marker undisturbed it will turn into a carnivorous plant and revive the rider to fight again.</p>\n<p>The game has three phases with multiple waves of Phantom Riders that must be defeated before moving onto the next level, taking the player closer to the phantom island. The game features a quasi-3D effect that all of the Phantom Riders fly in from the distant phantom island. As players proceed through levels, they get closer to the island. The last level has several dangers; Phantom Riders, fireballs, carnivorous plants, or drowning if Pegasus falls into the sea. The game allows for 1 or 2 players with duel and cooperative modes.</p>",

Defeat is inevitable, as the incoming missiles increase in speed and density. Some will suddenly split into multiple warheads targeting multiple islands, and if you survive long enough, the smart bombs will come out, capable of evading your interceptors. Your only advantages are the broad, area effect of your missiles, replacement islands awarded as your score races upward, and the lightning-fast, hand-eye coordination given by your ancestors just for playing video games like this one.</p>\n<p>A ROM cartridge, Polaris presents the standard elevation view of a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/4030/missile-command-variants/\">Missile Command</a> game, placing three submarines among six islands. Islands and submarines alike are targeted by missiles dropping from the top of the screen; destroyed subs come back the next round, and islands are replaced every 2000 points. Points are awarded for surviving islands, submarines, and interceptor missiles, multiplied by the level's difficulty. Interesting effects include color set changes which can camouflage incoming missiles, explosions which endure in mid-air as additional missiles reach the area, and explosions which wrap around from one edge of the screen to the other.</p>\n<p>Hot-seat, two-player play is possible, split by round with competing scores shown at the top of the screen. The manual even makes tongue-in-cheek mention that the scores can be targeted and blown up, but to no effect.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This ROM cartridge game provides a strategically faithful reproduction of the centuries-old game, Gomoku, and its newer variant, Renju. The colors of the board and pieces are not traditional, and the interface is simple, but the cartridge stores 78 variations of the traditional \"book openings\", including sequences well past the first few moves of the game. Further, it can selectively adhere to the complex strictures of Renju, prohibiting 24 opening moves and certain winning patterns any time during the game.</p>\n<p>The object of both games is to place five of your pieces in a row on a square, 15x15 board, with each player taking turns. In this implementation, the board can be reduced as small as 9x9. When playing against the computer, you can choose from eight levels of difficulty, move first or second (which defines your play in both games), switch sides, get a hint, take back any number of moves, review an entire game step-by-step, and watch the computer \"think\" or even play itself. Play against another human is possible, too, but the opening-move restrictions of Renju are left to you to enforce.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The latest breakthrough in nuclear power is broken. It's the network, of course. In the dazzling future of the late 1990's, the world's first fusion reactor is online: energy particles are shooting out of emission tubes toward the energy posts... and missing. As each one passes the posts and strikes another tube on the opposite side of the core, the reactor moves one step closer to meltdown. The reflectoid is there; that's the solid energy deflection device which bounces the particles into the posts. It's supposed be remotely controlled by a sophisticated network of computers, but tonight it has to be controlled by you!</p>\n<p><em>Reactoid</em> gives you a top-down view of the reactor core, the heart of Professor Albert Arnstein's experimental and top-secret power station. Twenty-four energy posts are at the center, surrounded by twenty particle emission tubes, any one of which could emit the next energy particle. You generate kilowatts (your score) by deflecting the particle into a post as it passes one. There's only one chance to get it right; after the first bounce off the reflectoid, the particle will just pass through it on a second attempt. If seven of those particles find their way to another emission tube, whether by shooting across the core undeflected or by your inept deflection, meltdown is reached. On the other hand, if you deflect particles into all of the posts, lighting them, you survive the round and are rewarded with a fresh start and two particles shooting across the core at a time. For each round you survive, the particles on the screen and the kilowatt multiplier increase. Three meltdowns and you're done, unless you've picked up a spare reflectoid along the way.</p>",

Your equipment: a scroll (which contains instructions from the game's manual) and a laser.</p>\n<p>Two missions have gone before you. Technology has improved since then, allowing electronic scans of the temple structure. It is a maze, and there is activity. Two million years ago a society steeped in wealth and the magic occupied the planet. Legend has it that they left behind a curse protecting their temples and the valuable artifacts contained within. Your purpose is \"to enrich the present by expanding our knowledge of the experiences and achievements of this past civilization.\"</p>\n<p>In game terms, this means blasting monsters and collecting treasure. Poisonous spiders and sentient fireballs occupy the rooms of the temple, while giant bats patrol overhead, swooping down when they spot you. Enticing you onward are golden cups, jade crosses, diamond rings, crystal goblets, and silver pitchers. Magical treasures such as crystal balls and golden crowns will for a time render you invisible and boost your laser, respectively.</p>\n<p>No small challenge is the maze itself, eerily reminiscent of a colossal computer chip. You have an overhead view, but only of a small portion, and it doesn't scroll until you're near the edge. The result is that while moving into new territory, you see only a half-dozen paces ahead. There are a few pairs of transfer portals, which will zap you across the maze, but as often with archeology, your investigation relies on legwork. The maze, occupants, and treasures are constant each play, so over time you can come to know the temple well, and your laser very well.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This ROM cartridge game challenges the player to draw circles around objects which pop up on the screen.</p>\n<p>Your joystick steers the head of a constantly moving line segment, which by circling it back upon itself, you can make into a loop. Capture an object within that loop, and you score points. Objects continue to appear on the screen, and stay until you circle them. Capture more than one object in the same loop and your reward is multiplied.</p>\n<p>The difficulty of the game is in avoiding the objects. Your line segment can run into itself and the edge of the map, but not one of the objects you're trying to circle. That ends your turn. Play becomes a trick of turning tighter and tighter circles to capture objects before they disappear, but not too tightly as to run into them. You can vary your speed, and correspondingly the length of your line segment, by the distance your joystick is from its center. The result is that at maximum speed and length, your line turns widely.</p>\n<p>Further increasing the challenge is that the objects move. Apples and cherries are nice and stationary, but the magnets drift slowly. The roller skates skate. Then the yo-yo's appear, doing what yo-yo's do. Timing becomes important.  The final complication is the skulls. They're worth no points and they don't go away until you crash. You just have to dodge them and keep circling the moving objects. Hot seat play for two players is possible, giving you the opportunity to laugh at someone else for their inability to draw a circle.</p>",

The player assumes the role of captain and ecologist on the starship Arkworld, the task is the survival of a colony of (randomized) alien lifeforms on a newly discovered planet. To fulfill it, animals and plants from the Arkworld's cargo hold can be added, with the goal to create a functioning, self-supporting ecosystem.</p>\n<p>By using the icon-driven interface, the environment as well as traits of the native colony and the species on board the ship can be examined. Various factors, such as the atmospheric elements that are expelled/inhaled and food habits play a role. The Arkworld contains two hundred species of animals and plants of randomized quantity, and there is also a limited option of genetic engineering, that may not necessarily produce the desired characteristics.\nTo make the simulation run it's course, the integrated time-control is locked into hypertime mode. The game will then run until all native animals are perished or the stability of the created ecology is proven for sixty-five thousand days. A save option is included.</p>",

The game was inspired by \"WarGames,\" an American movie of the same year which starts with a young hacker war-dialing to swipe a new game for his home computer, and ends reflecting the period's very real distrust of computers and defense systems.</p>\n<p><em>Wargame</em> presents the global view screen of NORAD's missile defense system, as envisioned by the movie. Missiles trace lines between ten American bases and ten Soviet bases, bright white circles blotting out the city on the receiving end. The object is to destroy the Soviet bases before all the American ones are gone, which takes five to ten minutes, the span often predicted in the 1980's for World War III.</p>\n<p>Commands are issued by typing fast, until the Soviets jam your launch codes, but you can recover and return the favor. Enemy subs require targeting, when you can find the time to detect them, and if you're really ahead of schedule, you can check base status on either side. Since missiles fly only one at a time, and computer responses eat precious seconds, victory mostly lies in efficient typing and remembering which bases you have left to launch from. Win or lose, the futility of trading the business ends of nuclear missiles is always clear.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Rainbow magazine, compiled a collection of text and graphical adventures programmed in BASIC. The default interface of early 1980's microcomputers, BASIC was familiar to every owner. Most of the 108-page manual is listings of BASIC code for each game; the challenge of programming in such a small space is a unifying theme. A couple, like \"The Door,\" fit into just four kilobytes, matching the total RAM of one retailed Color Computer model. \"The Door\" spoofs the universal frustration of all but a few '80's text adventures: figuring out how to tell the game what you wanted to do was often more difficult than knowing what to do. The games herein offer few exceptions to that rule, but the contributors, both amateur and professional developers, take the player to the limits of earth and outer space. Most of the background color and storyline are contained in the manual's introduction or the first screen of the game.</p>\n<p>Polynesia, Africa, the house down the street, the evil side of the universe, and even a dream provide settings. Two adventures show overhead views of your circumstance, but the rest rely on text to be your eyes and ears. Two-word responses at a command line prompt are typically all you need to unlock the mysteries.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Polynesian+Adventure\">Polynesian Adventure</a>: Hunt for treasure in the South Seas.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/219329/horror-house/\">Horror House</a>: Slaughter the computer's minions to prove you're no chicken.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Search+for+the+Ruby+Chalice\">Search for the Ruby Chalice</a>: Explore the wilds of Africa to find the world's most precious treasure.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Lighthouse+Adventure\">Lighthouse Adventure</a>: Finding the legendary pirate treasure is only half the challenge.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dungeon+Adventure\">Dungeon Adventure</a>: You get sidekicks, wandering monsters, and even a town in this dungeon-crawl RPG.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Sir+Randolph+of+the+Moors\">Sir Randolph of the Moors</a>Sir Randolph of the Moors: From rags to riches, a kid finds a sword and becomes a hero.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/207340/dreamer/\">Dreamer</a>: The program limits of four kilobytes of RAM make wandering through this dream appropriately Kafkaesque.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=One+Room\">One Room</a>: Blinfolded and tied up, all you have to do is get out.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/113989/the-door/\">The Door</a>: How quickly and how many of the 44 ways can you find to open it?</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dr.+Avaloe\">Dr. Avaloe</a>: The new job: Find your way through the mad scientist's deadly rooms.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=The+Deed+of+the+York\">The Deed of the York</a>: Brave the macabre traps left for you by your grandfather to inherit his fortune.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dungeon\">Dungeon</a>: Endure the maze of caverns to rescue the sweet princess from the despicable Groms.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=An+Unexplored+Mansion\">An Unexplored Mansion</a>: Setting out on your own, the adventure you find is a mysterious old mansion.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Escape+from+Sparta\">Escape from Sparta</a>: Preserve freedom in the universe by rescuing the creator of your robotic race.</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p>The CoCo version of <em>Tetris</em> is one of many conversions of the famous block-stacking game. The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete rows, which then disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.</p>\n<p>Options of the CoCo version include the selection of starting level (between 0 and 9) and a handicap setting, allowing to pre-fill the well with blocks in seven different levels. The playing level can be increased at any time and a preview of the next piece to appear can be toggled on and off. Scoring works similarly to the original PC version of the game as written by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/62651/vadim-gerasimov/\">Vadim Gerasimov</a>: there are more points the higher a piece is dropped, a bonus for not displaying the next piece and a bonus for playing in higher levels/difficulties. No points are given for clearing rows and there is no high score table.</p>\n<p>Implemented as a 'fat binary', the game offers a higher resolution mode on a CoCo 3. Besides displaying more of the Saint Basil's Cathedral-inspired background graphic, the CoCo 3 version allows to optionally display a keyboard command overview, the current level and a pieces statistic.</p>",

The player races a Formula 1 car from a third person perspective and can do so on five different tracks. Each race consists of five laps and the objective is to simply get the best time possible. At the same time other cars have to be avoided since crashing three times in the same race leads to game over. Upon completing a race the game automatically progresses to the next track. The game can be played with joystick or keyboard and features manual transmission with a single button used to switch between low and high gear.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Zenix</em> is a shoot 'em up that resembles <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8402/galaga/\">Galaga</a> albeit without the capture feature from that game. The enemies are invading insects that start out swarming around the screen before taking their positions above the player. At times groups of bugs leave the formation and attempt to crash into the player who can freely move (including up and down) around the bottom third of the screen. The bugs have different colours which indicates their level of armour. Those with a higher armour level require multiple hits to take down unless the player has access to armour piercing bullets.</p>\n<p>Unlike other shooters of its kind there is no life system. Instead there is a fuel meter that decreases when the ship is hit. Some of the enemies are fuel bugs. When these are hit they turn into a solid color and slowly drifts toward the bottom. These should be picked up since they refill some of the fuel and sometimes they also give an upgrade to the ship's weaponry. Weapon upgrades include armour piercing bullets and bullets splitting in three directions. </p>\n<p>In total there are 32 levels with increasing difficulty due to higher pace and more dangerous enemies. This includes monster bugs which instantly kills the player upon contact even if there is fuel is left. After every fourth level there is a bonus stage which allows the player to gain bonus points and consists of four waves of enemies that fly across the screen but that does not attack the player.</p>",

There are three different obstacles (asteroids, magnetic mines and alien ships) that the player has to shoot down since any collision will lead to a loss of one of the fleet ship. The fleet ships are also destroyed when running out of fuel which happens as they are hit by enemy fire. Refuelling is possible by manoeuvring the player's ship over one of the ships in the fleet. Some attackers can attach itself to a fleet ship to do a sneak attack and steal the ship.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Those Darn Marbles!</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Marble+Madness\">Marble Madness</a> variant. Like the original arcade game it involves moving a marble across isometric levels with the goal of reaching an exit point. Monsters, traps and long drops can stop the marble's progression but there is no limit on how many times the marble can be destroyed. The only way to fail with the game is by running out of time before reaching the ext. Extra speed can be gained by holding down the fire button which doubles the amount of acceleration. There are three different monsters: marble munchers which confuse the marble, acid pools which dissolves the marble into a pile of scunge and jehosaphats which cause the marble to perform an unintended action. Scoring is based on the number of squares rolled over and extra points are given when there is time left on the clock.</p>",

The player controls a robot that enters the system in an attempt to kill off all the bugs. Each level is a maze with a number of bugs that all have to be killed. The game is played with joystick that allow the player to wander through the corridors of the maze. When encountering enemies the player shoots by holding down the fire button and uses the stick to move the cursor around. Getting hit leads to the robot's energy being absorbed but it can recharged by locating and shooting power units. If the energy decreases to zero the game ends. Once a level has been completed an elevator exit will open and the player can move on to the next level.</p>",

The levels are timed and all pieces have to be collected before the time runs out.</p>\n<p>In the first level the player is seated in a canoe going down a river while later levels are on foot. The levels on foot allow the player to jump which is necessary in the non-scrolling levels for leaping between islands without landing in water. There are some perils to watch out for like moving objects and natives called guardians that throw spears. Some items can be picked up including a bow for shooting the guardians and a golden key which can be used to open a treasure chest which gives an extra life. In the eight level the aim is to get to a balloon and escape while in the final level the balloon is shot down and the player returns to the first scene and begins a new round of the game.</p>",

Like in the original game the cube is made up of 27 smaller cubes (called cubies) of six different colours and the aim is to rotate the slices so that each face is made up of a solid color. The cube is isometrically drawn and the player uses keyboard controls to roll the slices. While working on the cube it is possible to undo and redo up to 255 moves. A reset cube option allows the player to see how a particular cube is constructed and it's also possible to create custom cube configurations. There is also an option to use tapes to save and load games.</p>",

The game is played from a top down perspective with controls similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Asteroids\">Asteroids</a> where the player's task is simply to shoot down the spiders before getting killed. As the spiders move around the screen they leave a trail of web that can trap the player. It is possible to shoot through it but each shot will only clear a small part of it. There are two different spiders, slow and fast, and both can weave straight or jagged webs. It's necessary to be extra careful with the ones producing jagged webs since they will seek out and chase the player. Any contact with a spider leads to a life being lost. There are three lives but extra ones are given upon reaching 1000 points.</p>",

The aim of the game is simply to ski down a slope (which is randomly generated) and reach the finish banner in the shortest time without missing any gates or going off the piste. If a gate is missing or the skier veers off the piste, the time will not be recorded but the player is allowed to keep skiing. The game is played with a joystick and it is possible to choose between simple and complex controls. Simple controls involve using the stick to steer and speed up. With complex controls the button is used to simulate ski poles with speed being gained with each button press. The speed is then also affected by hills, slopes and moguls and the skier will slow down when making turns, especially sharp turns.</p>",

The player is in control of a helicopter flying over a mountainous terrain where hostile gun turrets, rockets, oil tanks and ICBM's are placed. On the ground there are also blue men that the player can pick up by flying over them. The helicopter's only weapons are missiles whose direction the player can steer by pulling the joystick up and down. The game is made up of one large level where the player simply has to try and stay alive as long as possible. A life is lost when hit by an enemy projectile but also when accidentally killing one of the blue men.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>La Belle Lucie</em> is a solitaire card game. The aim of the game is to move all cards from the tableau onto four foundations located at the top of the screen. The tableau is made up of seventeen groups of three cards and one with just a single card. Only the top card can be picked up and moved to another pile and it has to be of the same suit and at one lower than the card it is played onto. When adding cards to the foundations the player has to start with an ace and then add the 2 and the other cards in the suit in order until the king has been added. After the game has started it is possible to shuffle the cards but only twice. After the shuffles have been used a cheat move called The Merci will become available. It allows the player to pull any card regardless of position and add it to a foundation but it can only be used once.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Contras</em> is a platform shooter based on the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Contra\">Contra</a>. The main difference from the original Contra is that the whole game is played from a side view and that it lacks the behind view 3D stages. There are also differences in level design. While the first level is largely identical to the original game later levels are original.</p>\n<p>The basic gameplay is like the original game with the player moving from the left to right while killing all the enemies and destroying all turrets and other obstacles. While standing up it is possible to move and shoot in any of the eight directions (except down) while when lying down it is only possible to shoot forward. Destroying certain items leads to power ups called Falcons appearing and if the player collects them bonus points and weapons upgrades are given. Unlike the original game there is only one weapon upgrade: rapid fire.</p>\n<p>The game can be played by two players at the same time. The player that first loses all lives can steal one from the other player and keep playing. When both are out of lives an end screen appears and it's possible to continue at the beginning of the current level at a score of zero, but it can only be done three times.</p>",

The game takes place on a board consisting of 64 squares where the player competes against a computer controlled evil wizard called Varloc. On each side there are sixteen warriors: a witch, a sorcerer's apprentice, a minotaur, two archers, two knights, four dwarfs and four trolls. Like in chess each warrior is only allowed certain moves. To win the game it is necessary to defeat the enemy's wizard. If the player manages to find a hidden gem, it is possible to kill Varloc with a single hit.</p>\n<p>When two warriors clash on the board the game moves to a battlefield where the player has to defeat Varloc's warrior in a one-on-one duel. Unlike the battles of Archon, the game uses wireframe 3D graphics displayed from a first person perspective. Each warrior has its own way of attacking and defending. The minotaur rams into opponents while knights attack with a sword and can defend with a shield. Dwarfs can disappear at will while the wizard, the witch and the apprentice can shapeshift into three deadly animals: bat, snake or spider. The wizard can also turn into any of the other warriors.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Taxi</em> is a driving game where the player takes on the role of a taxi driver. As can be expected the game is about picking up and delivering passengers. The game contains six cities (Dallas, New York, San Francisco, London, Paris and Shanghai) each which is a single screen level played from a top down perspective. As a passenger appears the player uses the joystick to drive to it and pulls up to the curb to pick it up. It's destination will then appear as a cross on the map and the player has to drive there. Each delivered passenger gives a fare and a tip. Driving directly to the destination leads to a big tip while taking a detour leads to a smaller one. When driving it's necessary to watch out for red lights. Driving past one leads to a fine and the passenger will be lost. </p>\n<p>The game can be played by two players who then have to cooperate in gaining money for the company.</p>",

This version of the game features largely identical gameplay and contains all three levels from the original game. The player's task is to collect the items dropped by the woman that in this version is called Elsie and not Olive Oyl. In the first level they are hearts, in the second notes and in the third letters making out the word HELP. At the same time it is necessary to avoid Bigfatbadguy who is pursuing the player as well as Olduglyseawoman who throws bottles. These have to be either avoided or punched. Bigfatbadguy can only be taken out for a short while by hitting a punching bag so that a bucket falls down on his head. On all screens it is possible to eat a can of collard greens to gain extra speed, strength and agility which allows the player to knock out Bigfatbadguy.</p>\n<p>The game can be customized from an options screen. It is possible to select which screen each player starts at, the number of lives as well as the difficulty level. There is also an invisible screen mode where all of the background graphics (including platforms and ladders) disappear.</p>",

It is possible to switch from a right handed batter to a left handed. Swinging is done by pressing the button and the power is decided by up-down position of the joystick. When running the player is always in control of the lead base runner.</p>\n<p>When on the field, the player controls both the pitcher and all the other players. Different pitches can be done by pulling the joystick in different directions. For example a downward pull leads to a fast pitch while a diagonal downward pull leads to a curved ball. When the ball is in the air control is automatically given to the fielder that is closest to it. Once the ball has been caught the joystick is used to choose which player to throw it to.</p>",

This game is able to take advantage of the Tandy Sound &amp; Speech Cartridge, if present. The player initially starts on \"Screen 1\", and progresses through levels where the hazards move faster and additional hazards are introduced. The game was developed in Australia.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Fire Copter</em>, the player controls a helicopter armed with both lasers and water cannons. 1-player and 2-player games are available, with players taking alternative helicopter control. The player scrolls over a 3-dimensional wireframe city, looking for active fires. The player needs to position the copter over the center of the fire to spray water cannons to put out the fire. In addition, fire starting androids are present throughout the city, which need to be shot with the copter's laser cannons. The player receives points for fires put out and androids destroyed. As fire spreads, the city is in critical danger, and the player loses a life when too much of the city is engulfed in flame. The player has a total of 3 lives, and when all are lost it's game over. The fire has been quelled at the start of each life, and the city begins to burn anew.</p>",

That's when they discovered The Code Book to control the top secret experimental satellite codenamed Nebulous Project had been stolen. </p>\n<p>The player can choose from 7 possible characters, each with their individual strengths and weaknesses.

At the beginning of each session, the player is assigned weather conditions hot or cold and wet or dry. They then try to grow 4 of 16 different plants. Each plant prefers different weather conditions, and has different pest resistance. The more slowly a plant grows, the more it's worth when harvested. Plants begin to grow from the bottom of the screen, and they must be harvested when they reach the top and bloom. Verms live underground, and Grobot must descend from his harvester to scare away the Verm to prevent it from eating the crops. Gnats fly onto flowers and eat them, and can be scared away with the harvester.</p>",

The Xs can be picked back up again if needed, but each use of an X causes a loss of score. There are numerous gates, including: speed, jump, invisible, and magic. These affect character movement speed and the supply and effect of Xs. The game ends when the star has been captured. Players can create custom maps, where they define these parameters.

        "description": "<p><em>Atom</em> is an educational game to teach children about the elements.</p>\n<p>The player controls a gravitron, which circles around the central atom on the screen. The central nucleus is surrounded by 2 spinning rings, an inner energy level and an outer barrier ring. The goal is to pick up stray electrons, and shoot them towards the spaces within the inner ring, so that they become a part of the atom. If the player shoots the barrier ring with an electron, the inner nucleus will explode. The player must hide behind a gravitron bunker in the corner of the screen to survive. The player starts with 3 gravitrons, and it's game over when they are lost. A countdown in nanoseconds tells the player how long they have left to create the required atoms. The player creates the first 52 elements.</p>",

The good king could tolerate no more, and therefore commissioned the wizard Merlin to use his mystical wisdom to find a solution.</p>\n<p>Colored smoke and roaring sounds billowed from Merlin's cave for a fortnight. Suddenly one midday, darkness befell the land. A flaming star burst forth from the cave's entrance. Behind this deadly fireball appeared Merlin, carrying two long magical pikes. </p>\n<p>Each player controls a magical pike, as they try to bounce the fireball between the opposite sides of the screen. The pike can be moved in all directions, and if their castle is hit by a fireball, it takes damage. Two lakes, each in a corner of the screen, serve to slow the fireball by cooling it down.

One terrible day the Good Wizard was abducted by his jealous evil brother and imprisoned in The Castle of Tharoggad. The Evil Wizard populated the castle with many horrible phantasms which solidify and attempt to kill any trespasser they encounter in the castle. He also set a few dangerous traps for any foolhardy adventurer who attempts to rescue the Good Wizard. As the bravest and strongest hero in the land, you are selected by the townspeople to enter the Castle of Tharoggad and save the Good Wizard.</p>\n<p><em>Castle of Tharoggad</em> is a colored mouse-driven version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/22268/dungeons-of-daggorath/\">Dungeons of Daggorath</a></p>\n<p>All commands are via the movement, inventory, use, drop, and pick up buttons. The game contains five levels of dungeon to explore via a 1st person perspective, with more powerful monsters the deeper the player advances. Other features include monsters generating different sounds that grow louder or fainter as they get closer to the protagonist (even if they cannot be seen behind walls); and the real-time aspect of the heartbeat. If the player is injured or running too fast, his heart rate increases, and he may pass out if the player pushes too far. During that time, monsters keep moving and attacking.</p>",

This maze, composed of 32 different planes, is filled with fabulous treasures, but is fraught with hidden dangers and deadly bad guys. The immensely valuable Maze Melon has been taken by the evil Maze Marauder, and placed in the lowest plane of the maze. Springster must recover the melon and return it to the highest level. </p>\n<p>The player controls a spring, which can move in all directions on a maze, but can not move to levels that are too high or low. There are 8 total platform levels. On each level, the player has a limited amount of time to gather the displayed number of treasures. After this, the player must obtain a pot of gold and move it to a red square. This opens the purple square, which the player must land on to move to the next level. If the player is holding an emerald ring, and moves onto a red square, all enemies will temporarily become disoriented and move randomly. If the player moves onto a green square, they will kill all enemies on other green squares. After several uses, these squares turn black, and mean instant death. If the player is caught by an enemy, it's game over. Dark blue squares reveals special prizes, and light blue squares will make a player invisible if they are holding a candle.</p>",

You are a ZoneRunner, an interplanetary soldier of fortune, about to embark on your next mission. Your adventure entails flying your spacecraft among planets located in the outlying area of two closely situated galaxies. Your livelihood depends on buying and selling vitally-needed goods. </p>\n<p>The player moves between planets buying and selling commodities to increase their wealth. To move between locations, the player selects the direction of movement and their engine power. Player location is shown on a galactic map with 3 levels of magnification. Upon arriving at different systems, the player can buy and sell commodities. Control of shields and weapons are also controlled by sliding bars, and these need to be replenished at systems. </p>\n<p>As the player travels, they are at danger of attack by enemy vessels, which can steal the players goods.</p>\n<p>If the player doesn't meet the needs of planets, the prices of commodities can go up, and planets can even die. As planets die, the player has to work harder to supply needs. When all planets die, it's game over.</p>",

You awaken to a myriad of passages filled with monsters.</p>\n<p>The player controls a small character who must move through a maze to reach the exit to the next level. The player is armed with dynamite, which is dropped to blow up enemies and weak walls. As the player is attacked by monsters, they lose bricks, but can pick up more in the maze. Some exits are locked, and the player must discover a specific route to the exit to open the door. The player can construct walls to protect themselves from enemies, but certain enemies can chew through these. The player has a single life, and it's game over if eaten by an enemy.</p>",

As fossil fuels become scarce, the need for a new, inexhaustible source of energy grows more and more. In a dimly lit laboratory, a professor is experimenting on a newly discovered sub-atomic particle. This particle has been named, Neutroid and is causing great controversy in 'The Neutroid Project'.</p>\n<p>The player controls the Neutroid on a large grid within the Particle Vault. The player must avoid Antitroids which move on the grid and are attracted to the Neutroid. Protroid particles and special maintenance units called Grid Charges are adjacent. The player tries to collide the Neutroid with the stream of Protroids, removing the Protroids from the stream. If the player collides with a wall or an Antitroid, it begins to heat up, and after too many collisions the system will overheat. If all Protroids are removed from the system, the player advances to a more difficult level. </p>\n<p>Science is counting on you professor! Complete each grid quickly before the particle vaults reach the meltdown state, else all is lost!\"</p>",

Gameplay allows for 1-player or 2-player cooperative. The player can move rapidly left and right, but can also flap their bird's wings to raise up in the air. Enemy mounted knights appear, and the player must destroy them by hitting them from above or behind, otherwise they lose a life. When hit, knights turn into eggs, which land on the platforms. These must be picked up before they hatch into a new knight, which they be picked up by a mount to ride again. There are 15 levels of difficulty, and the player starts with 5 lives. As stages increase, new challenges like disappearing platforms or invincible dragons appear.</p>",

At the beginning of each turn, the player rolls 2 dice. That value represents the number the player can't roll without penalty. The player then repeatedly rolls 2 dice, and moves that value along the board. Every roll, the player can choose to roll again or stay. If the player hits the penalty value, they are sent back to where they started the round. Once the player stays, they will restart in that position on future rounds.</p>",

While drawing the rectangles, the player needs to avoid the Qiks, a series of colored lines that crawl the screen, and the Sparks that travel around the border and any lines the player has made. The Fuse travels along new lines, preventing the player from moving too slowly. The player has limited time per stage.

To this land began the appearance of a number of horrible twisted creatures which decimated the lands of the three races. </p>\n<p>Suddenly, a stranger arrived. His knowledge of magical arts and swordsmanship seemed unlimited. With these tools, he was able to put the evil creatures to slaughter, and spent his remaining days teaching the arts to the three races. </p>\n<p>In time this stranger passed, and he was remembered as the Paladin. Over time, the three races began to draw apart once more. The creatures have once again begun to appear, and the King of the land has been kidnapped by the forces of darkness. The player must rescue the lost monarch and reunite the land of Tarnith. </p>\n<p>At the beginning of each game, the player creates a new character, spreading 60 attribute points between strength, dexterity, intelligence, and wisdom. The player moves about from a top-down perspective, and can enter various castles and towns from the overland map. The player can talk to the various inhabitants of Tarnith for clues to solve puzzles. Food, armor, weapons, and healing potions can be purchased from various stores. Every 1000 experience points, the player can visit the Queen of Tarnith to level up, which increases maximum hitpoints.</p>\n<p>In combat, the player and monster takes turns exchanging blows until one is destroyed.</p>",

It worked well, and the people were happy (at least, the people who's opinions counted). Suddenly, a mysterious electronic intelligence appeared and began to drain the world's energy. The robot, named Ludevide, declared his intentions to continue to do so for the foreseeable future, and challenged anyone to try and stop him. </p>\n<p>The scientists constructed the PT (Power Tank) series, a weapon intended to house a worker as attempted to force his way through the myriad layers of Ludevide's stronghold. The fortress is populated by beasts made of plasma and mindless DUPES (Dense Units of Photon Energy). Each of these is deadly to the PT, and successive contact with these guardians will lead to total destruction. </p>\n<p>You have just been volunteered to pilot the newest model PT. The PT can be moved in the cardinal directions, and is able to push or pull pieces of Ludevide's castle. The goal on each level is to reach the exit point while avoiding enemy attacks. Power is used for moving the tank or teleporting objects. The PT takes damage when contacting guardian creatures, and this will drain energy to enact repairs. If all energy is drained and the tank is completely damaged, it is game over. There are 15 levels of increasing difficulty.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Warrior King</em> is a 1-player side-scrolling fantasy-themed clone of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1883/rastan/\">Rastan</a> for the TRS-80 CoCo.</p>\n<p>In an age of savagery and magic, where kings held their power by the might of their sword arm, one man stood alone. His name was Rastann, Warrior King of Aqualone. All who knew him feared his wrath, yet respected his integrity. He held his power and authority with a firm, yet fair hand. However, within the midst of the Battle of Faerendor, his crown was stolen by a changeling spy and spirited away. The Barbarian army under his command were a superstitious lot, rooted deep in tradition and religion where law failed to hold sway. They threatened to revolt, refusing to serve a king without a crown. Most of the army left to the Northlands; few remained loyal. The simple Battle of Faerendor had turned into a fight not only for Rastann's kinghood, but his life. Rastaan was desperate and only one route remained open: to recover the crown hidden within the deeplands of Faerendor.</p>\n<p>The player controls a warrior, as he does battle with lizardmen and skeletons. The player can move laterally, jump, duck, and swing his sword high, low, or backwards. The player has limited health, and takes damage from enemy attack. Magic vials can restore a small amount of health, and the player can pick up jewelry and special powerful weapons as they explore. The player must carefully avoid falling in water or lava, and can climb up or down ropes. The player starts with 3 lives.</p>",

Every bait the player collects causes the snake to elongate. If the player does not collect bait, the snake speeds up. If the snake bites itself, the player loses a life. A level is cleared by collecting all bait, and there are 10 different levels. Sometimes, the buzz worm will drop an egg. This is worth a large bonus if eaten, and a free man if it remains on the screen after all bait has been consumed. The player starts with three lives.</p>",

Each level starts with at least 1 friendly bat to help the player. The sun chases the player about the maze, and people drop crosses if they encounter another human, both of which are fatal to the player. The people constantly run from the player, and they can only be captured if led to a dead-end or trapped between the vampire and a bat. Each human captured becomes a bat, which further helps the player. Once per level, the player gains the ability to destroy 3 cross. The player starts with 3 lives, and gain an extra life each level. Each level presents a new Halloween pun.</p>",

The plane is controlled from a 1st person perspective, and closely models real aspects of the P51 Mustang. The instrument panel includes air speed indicator, altimeter, MDA light, heading indicator, fuel gauge, radar, and throttle indicator. Ground locations are divided into friendly and enemy territory, and the player can hide from opponent radar below 500 feet, but is susceptible to enemy ground fire. There are 3 levels of difficulty for each player, and bullet holes appear on the screen as the player takes fire.</p>",

The player digs a tunnel as they move, and if they burrow beneath boulders, these fall down crushing the player or monster underneath. The player is armed with a pump, which can inflate enemies and cause them to be destroyed. If the player has to stop inflating an enemy, they will eventually return to normal size. Enemies each start in their own section of the cavern, but they can sometimes move through solid rock to attack the player. If the player touches an enemy, they lose a life, and there are 3 lives at the beginning.</p>",

Yu are a mercenary, one of those who gains fortune by fighting for those who would rather not. Recently, the Wizard of the Moors has come out from his self-imposed solitude. It seems that he has stayed too long within his hold and is in need of entertainment. As a result, much of the populous has been lost. The ruler of this area, King Baccinus, has looked upon this turn of events with disfavor as the famed necromancer is killing his beloved taxpayers. Therefore, the king has sent for you, believing that only you and your comrades can win your way into the Darkmoors and defeat the dark Wizard. </p>\n<p>The player controls 3 characters, an elf, a human, and a dwarf, who are given independent commands each turn. The dwarf is a good fighter, while the human is more resistant to damage. The elf can perceive things the others can not, and has spell casting ability. </p>\n<p>The player moves through levels with the direction commands, and each area is graphically displayed on the screen. On each level, the player must find a weapon, an item of defense, and a treasure, and then find the stairs to descend to a lower level. The player can descend sooner if they choose. Characters level up and are healed the first time they descend a level. Monsters become progressively harder every time they descend a level. There are 10 levels in total, with the Wizard at the bottom.</p>\n<p>There is a save and restore feature, and all commands are via text entry.</p>",

The goal is to promote population growth by adequately managing resources. Rats pose constant danger to grain stores, and losses can be minimized by maintaining a health population of cats. Men at Arms can help protect lambs and the population. The player has to raise taxes to pay for their expenditures. The player can enhance their city by purchasing boats, bazaars, armories, castles, abbeys, and more acreage.

The King of Ursea, King Winslick, is a good king, and has long ruled the kingdom with a firm hand and virtuous heart, but he is nearing the end of his life and is fast losing health.  The King has declared that the person who can return his stolen scepter, the Scepter of Ursea, shall become the new ruler of the land.  And so you begin your quest.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of every quest, the player roles a character's statistics of strength, dexterity, and constitution.  From these, damage adjustment, armor class, and hit points are derived.  </p>\n<p>Gameplay starts on the overworld, and the player can explore the lands of Ursea, which encompasses multiple screens.  Movement uses fatigue, and if the player doesn't rest before their fatigue reaches 0, they die.  Encounters interrupt the player's explorations, and some encounters are friendly allowing the player to buy information or goods.  Exploration can be aided by boats or horses.  The player can enter the dungeon, where numerous dangers and treasures lie.  </p>\n<p>During combat, the player first enters the tactical display, where they choose which creature in a group to fight.  After choosing an enemy, the player and enemy take turns rolling a 20-sided dice for damage, with a minimum threshold to score a hit.  Creatures and the player can have multiple attacks per round.</p>",

Quandic is already an advanced civilization dedicated to pure science. Their aims include elimination of disease, space discovery, time travel, and the creation of a wise government. Their scientists have done well, and the great discovery of the year is the Time Machine.</p>\n<p>But, unfortunately for Quandic and the world, one of Quandic's foremost scientists, Cerderic, while working on a breakthrough of human disease, succumbed to the disease himself. He has gone berserk, and his deviousness and sickness make him a fugitive. No one can help him.</p>\n<p>He has stolen the time machine, dismantled it, and sent the pieces into the future. Most were recovered, but one, the key piece (of course), is somewhere in the present time. The future of the Quandic depends upon locating this critical part. The object of this adventure is to locate this item for the good of all times and peoples. You have been sent to the general vicinity, and are ready to begin your search. </p>\n<p>All locations have a graphical and text description. Commands are via text entry. Inventory is always shown in the upper left of the screen. A timer shows the elapsed time so far during the adventure. There is a save and restore feature available.</p>",

The player has the aid of 10 men in the expedition, and it's game over when all are lost. Each turn, the player has the chance to go left, right, or forward into the dungeon. These options bring the player a bit closer to their destination. Sometimes area have enemies, which the player can try to hide from, retreat from, or attack. Retreating brings the player further from their destination, while hiding has a risk of entering combat. The player must manage their food to keep their party fed, and must maintain a store of weapons to fight the dangers of the jungle. Along the way, the player can encounter friendly natives to trade with, and can also search for supplies. Digging can often reveal traps and other dangers, while searching can help find supplies. During combat, the player chooses what weapons to use, and then takes turns attacking the enemy as it approaches, with each hit leading to a loss of men. If the player retreats, they lose distance to their goal.</p>",

The goal is to capture the major Russian cities using Nazi forces. Gameplay occurs on a map of Eastern Europe, and the player control cavalry units, panzer corps, tank armies, and infantry units. Each player takes turns moving forces and attacking enemies units. Forces can be moved in standard, attrition, blitz, entrench, and march mode, which effect speed and combat ability. Forces will be resupplied each month if they can make a direct line back to their side of the screen. Better supplied units fight better in combat. Each unit has a zone of control, forcing enemies to engage in combat if they enter this area. </p>\n<p>Game play occurs in 1 week time units. Weather effects troop movement, and mud season slows the German advance. Rivers and lakes freeze solid in the winter. There are 5 levels of difficulty, with more difficult challenges including more Russian forces and longer play time. Games can be saved in progress.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Nuke the Love Boat!</em> is a graphical adventure for the TRS-80 CoCo.</p>\n<p>They are bent on detonating their stolen nuclear device on board but you stumbled upon it first. Captain Stubing was injured fighting the terrorists. You are now acting captain. With the help of Doc, Julie, Gopher, the rest of the crew, and an assortment of guest stars, you must form a commando army to keep the bomb, and the ship, out of terrorist hands. You discovered the terrorists planting the bomb in the communication room. </p>\n<p>Surprised, they dropped the suitcase containing the bomb and fled. Gopher grabbed a flaregun and fired it at the fleeing terrorists. The flare exploded in the communications room, destroying it. You are now all but stranded in the middle of the ocean with terrorists aboard. Hopefully, all of the passengers are safe, as they are watching \"Sink the Titantic!\" in the showroom. Or are they all accounted for? </p>\n<p>The terrorists have automatic weapons which could be hazardous to your health. Your only weapons are the ones your ingenuity can create. This strategy simulation is much more than a sitcom. It's a race against time and all the odds. The fate of primetime America rests in your hands. Can you stop Abdul Mullah before he Nukes the Love Boat!'?</p>\n<p>Based upon the 1970s sitcom, the player much search the Love Boat in search of items which can be converted to weapons to fight off the terrorist threat. All commands are via menu structures, and navigation is via a plan of the ship. The player can communicate with and ask the cast members for help with the mission. Once weapons are assembled, the player can send cast members off on missions to try to stop the terrorist threat. There is a save and reload feature. If the player messes up, the show is cancelled by a network executive.</p>",

All four stages of the original game are present.</p>\n<p>Junior, son of a monkey, must free his son from the evil Luigi. He does this by climbing up and down vines and jumping between platforms, avoiding the crocodile-like creatures that run up and down the vines. On later screens, he must climb chains to push locks into position so that the cage holding his son is opened. Finally, the player enters Luigi's lair, where they must avoid large electrical creatures. Fruits can be found hanging on the vines and chains, which can be picked up for points, upon which they drop, eliminating any enemies unfortunate enough to be positioned underneath.</p>",

The player navigates on a large 2D field that scrolls infinitely in all directions. The player travels through time, fighting progressively more advanced aircraft, starting with simple bi-planes, advancing to helicopters and jets, and finally to UFOs and other futuristic vessels. The goal on each level is destroy a number of enemy vessels until a boss vehicle appears and is defeated. When an enemy ship is shot down, it turns into a person parachuting to the ground, which can be picked up for bonus points.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Mis-Adventures of Eddie</em> is a graphical adventure for the TRS-80 CoCo.</p>\n<p>Hiking in the mountains one sunny morning with your trusty golden retriever, you come across an abandoned mine shaft. Dust and cobwebs fill the tunnel, looking as if no one has been there for decades. You get your lantern out of your backpack and shine it down the shaft. Several crickets now become silent as you gaze down the tunnel, which goes on as far as the eye can see. Suddenly your dog takes off down the shaft, barking madly. You chase him with backpack lugging from side to side. </p>\n<p>As you run after your dog you remember an old tale. Many years ago, there was a mining family who would not leave their boom town, even when the mines were empty of gold. They told people the mines held more that they thought. This family was after something much more, they wanted to live forever, and claimed the mines prolonged life. People called them crazy and left them to their fantasies. Several months later a mining shaft collapsed, tragically killing the miner's wife. Nobody has heard from the miner or his son since, but some say they still live in their mine, happy and content, almost a century later. But really, that's just a story told around a campfire late at night. Now where did that dog go?</p>\n<p>As the player enters the caverns, they meet the old man, and learn that his son has escaped into the time continuum and may change the course of history. The player moves through a maze of tunnels. In this maze, are a series of fields of mist, which take the player to different time zones, each one containing Eddie. In each area, the player must collect gems and stop the bumbling Eddie from messing up history. </p>\n<p>All commands are created by typing VERB NOUN entries. There are a limited number of hints available per game. There is a save and restore feature. The time and compass direction are displayed on the screen, including available movement directions.</p>",

Blessed with super powers, you have decided to use these abilities to fight crime. Unfortunately, the criminal mastermind Mr. Bigg has decided to use his superpowers to rule mankind instead of help. Mr. Bigg has plotted to take over the fair city of Oakdale, and you are determined to stop him at all costs. Mr. Bigg has hired a small army of villains, and will use them to stop you. </p>\n<p>You must search the city of Oakdale and gather the 3 components necessary to tune into the aural frequencies of Mr. Bigg, and track down the chief villain. You also must find the Power Drain, the only device which will allow you to defeat Mr. Bigg in combat. </p>\n<p>There are 3 levels of difficulty. The game screen is divided into messages, commands, and a small map of the surrounding area. The player has the option to fly or walk. In fly mode, the game moves in real time, and the player can not interact with the villains. During this mode, the enemies move on their own. When the player lands, they enter walk mode, where gameplay is turn-based, and the player can search, take items, view their map, or fight with the various villains. The player can not search an area or get an item until all villains in that area have been defeated. </p>\n<p>In combat, the player can punch, kick, dodge, blast, retreat, target specific areas, or use the power drain if in possession. Enemies are shown on the screen, and their attacks are animated. The player has limited strength, which is permanently lost with each hit. Endurance is drained by using actions, but is replenished during flight. </p>\n<p>Victory is achieved by defeating Mr. Bigg. Defeat occurs when the villains take over the city, or all health is lost.</p>",

A map of the nearby and previously explored areas are available on each level to assist the player with navigation. As the game progresses, the tank becomes armed with multiple different offensive and defensive systems, as well as stealth equipment. The tank is also armed with a radar sweep target indicator and the number and type of enemy vehicles currently in radar range. This equipment can be modified by being close to headquarters. For each mission, the tank has limited fuel and shield capacity, and tank systems can become damaged from enemy fire. </p>\n<p>There are 4 types of enemy vehicles: flamethrowers, mobile pillboxes, battle tanks, and tank destroyers, each with unique offensive, defensive, and movement capacities. Four minutes into every mission, a surveillance aircraft arrives, which beams the location of your tank to all surviving enemy vessels. Four minutes after this, a transport plane arrives, and begins to deliver new enemy reinforcements at a rate of 1 every 12 seconds. This necessitates the player quickly destroying enemy vehicles and reaching their destination.</p>",

Their only means of a defense is a shovel, used to dig holes to trap aliens. Holes cannot be dug on the bottom level. A trapped alien can be destroyed by reburying it, but if the alien escapes, it emerges in a more powerful form. The player has limited oxygen to complete each level, and starts with 3 lives. The player advances to a more challenging level by destroying all aliens present on the screen.</p>",

Each can move in 8 directions, and shoot some sort of ranged attack. The player must navigate mazes fighting enemies. Players' health constantly falls, and must be replenished by gathering food. Keys are collected to unlock doors, and the goal of each level is to reach the exit square. Certain terrain can be shot, and treasure can be gathered for bonus points. Enemies spawn from specific points, which can be destroyed. With a speech pack installed, the game will narrate character actions. The game is over when all characters have lost their health.</p>",

The character must collect gold from a series of platforms, and take them to the top-most ladder to advance to the next level. Enemy characters relentlessly pursue the player, and take their life if they catch them. Enemies will also pick up gold, and the player must retrieve it by dropping the enemy into a hole. Enemies can only exit and enter ladders from the top or the bottom, while a player can exit or enter a ladder at any point. The player starts with 3 lives.</p>",

Every hit that connects with the opponent increases the KO meter, allowing the player to land devastating punches if this is maxed out. The player and opponent also both have a health bar on the left of the screen. If the opponent is knocked down 3 times, or takes devastating hits, they stay down. If the player is knocked down once, it's game over. The player can regain some health by damaging their opponent at a full KO meter. If the player loses a match, it's game over, and must climb the ranking once again.</p>",

The scorpion can be defeated by standing below a yellow block when the scorpion is very near. The ball will change blocks back to blue.

Each treasure collected garnishes the player points, and partially refills their rapidly depleting time gauge. The player starts with 3 bombs, which can be used to destroy walls of the maze. Extra bombs can be picked up from treasure chests. If the player gets eaten by a dragon, or runs out of time, it's game over. The maze is randomized each game.</p>",

If the eggs are not collected in a timely fashion, they will drop and create a big mess which must be picked up with a shovel and taken to the trash pile. If eggs drop from the chute, the window to the coop will be jarred open, and the player must use a hammer to fix it. The player must also watch out for the chicken thief and the fox, who approach the chicken coop from the top right of the screen, and can be defeated with a club or rock salt respectively. These tools are located in the tool shed, and can only be used one at a time, and must be replaced before acquiring a new tool. There are 3 levels of difficulty.

Two creatures at the edges of the screen place balls on the conveyor belt, which randomly fall. As the seal catches progressively more balls, they balance on the tip of his nose until they reach the top of the screen. When the player catches 6 balls, they move to the next level. If the player misses a ball, they can still flip the ball back up in the air with their flippers to try to catch it again, but if it hits the ground the ball is lost. If the player misses too many balls, it's game over.</p>",

The goal is to collect as many pellets as possible without coming in contact with the opponent vehicle. The opponent vehicle will always try to change lane towards the player, and can move one lane per opening. The player can change one or two lanes per opening, and must outmaneuver their opponent. Because shorter inside lanes take less time to traverse, the time between two vehicles passing remains variable. It's game over if the two vehicles connect.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Stellar Search</em> is a series of 4 science fiction themed games set as a continuing story.</p>\n<p>The player takes on the role of captain of the U.S.S. Enterprise. The Federation has recently recovered a space probe of unknown origin. By careful study of the probe's trajectory, we have traced it back to the quadrant from which it was sent. Unfortunately, this quadrant has several black holes making it impossible to trace the proper sector of origin within the quadrant. Your goal is to make first contact with the alien race, and decide if they would make good members for the Federation. </p>\n<p>In part 1, the player must explore a number of quadrants on a 12 x 8 board trying to find the hidden planet. Some squares are empty, some contain a black hole which drains the player's energy, and some have enemy Klingon vessels which the player must manage their shields, phasers, torpedoes and other weapons. The player can recharge at several star bases. After discovering the correct quadrant, the player must navigate a shuttle craft to the planet's surface.</p>\n<p>In part 2, the aliens have taken the shuttle crew hostage. The player's job is to rescue them and try to arrange some type of agreement between the aliens and Federation. The player can fire phasers, try to beam down to the surface, communicate with the aliens, leave orbit, or arm engines. The player can speak with their bridge crew, and must defeat an incoming Klingon fleet to protect the planet.</p>\n<p>In part 3, the player beams down to the alien planet's surface and must try to rescue the captured shuttle crew. Armed with their tricorder and phaser, the player enters a text adventure and must navigate through a 5 x 5 map. The player can examine items, check their inventory, use items, look at a their map, and take items.</p>\n<p>Finally, in part 4, the game switches to a side-view arcade section. The player must level terrain by dropping bombs, so they can safely land on the planet's surface to rescue the Captain. If the shuttlecraft hits the land, they must restart. There are 4 levels of difficulty.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Duo Deck Solitaire</em> is a series of 2 solitaire games for the TRS-80 CoCo.</p>\n<p>Each game requires 2 decks of cards to play:* Sly Fox: 4 aces and 4 kings, 1 of each suit are removed from the double deck. 20 additional cards are placed in a 4 x 5 pile between them. The player tries to build up the ace foundation, while building down the king foundation. During the first phase, cards placed on either foundation are immediately filled from the stock. In the second phase, 20 cards are placed on the 4 x 5 pile in whichever positions the player chooses. The player then tries to place as many cards as they can in the 3rd phase, but spaces are not refilled. The second and third phases are repeated until there are no moves remaining or the foundations are filled.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Windmill: Gameplay starts with cards placed in the shape of a cross, with an ace in the center called the primary foundation. The 4 empty spaces between the arms of the cross are the secondary foundations. The arms of the cross represent 8 reserve positions. The primary foundation is played from ace up, while the secondary foundations are played from king downwards. Cards are played from the stock or the waste to try to complete the foundations. Gameplay ends when all foundations have been filled.</li>\n</ul>",

A number of dangers appear as the player travels, and these can be avoided by specific items, or simply rolling for fate points. If the player rolls poorly, they can lose stamina or be instantly killed by the dangers of the jungle. Further, if stamina falls to 0 the player perishes.

King Brighton had a fair and generous Queen, a beautiful daughter, Leonore, and a true friend, the good wizard Lothar. </p>\n<p>Shannon, King of neighboring Arth, had proposed marriage of his son Griswold to Leonore. King Brighton politely declined. Humiliated, King Shannon called upon demons for revenge. They descended upon Lynn, killing King Brighton and possessing the wizard Lothar. </p>\n<p>Lothar, once a kind man, turned into a cruel and heartless villain. He sought the crown and Leonore's marriage for himself, and when refused, stole her spirit, and hid it in both ordinary and magical containers. Leonore became zombie like, spending her days sitting her chamber, speaking to no one. </p>\n<p>The Queen, in turn, promised her daughter's hand and the kingdom to whomever could retrieve Leonore's spirit. Many of the land's bravest soldiers have gone to their death, one by one. Finally, you, Hector, an uneducated street brawler, and on of a pig farmer, present yourself to the Queen. It is your turn to take up the quest.</p>\n<p>The player controls Hector, who can move sideways, walk, run, jump short, jump long, climb up and down ladders, duck, punch, and stab with his sword. The player can can acquire objects, and must be careful, as Hector can only fall short distances. The player explores different scenes, where he does battle with the minions of Lothar, and tries to recover the 15 objects that contain fragments of Leonore's spirit. There are other evil objects which will injure the player. The player has limited lives, and can take only so many injuries before losing a life. If all lives are lost, the player can restart an area.</p>\n<p>There are 4 levels: outside, in the castle, and 2 dungeons.</p>",

The next morning, you awoke only to discover that the hospital had been abandoned by every doctor, nurse, and patient except yourself. The object is to save yourself from whatever the cause of evacuation might be. Unfortunately, this 'cause' has rearranged and hidden objects, broken equipment, and damaged furniture so that the simplest objectives are turned into the most difficult obstacles.</p>\n<p>All locations are graphically displayed on the screen, and available directions are displayed. The player must solve a number of inventory based puzzles. Large germs approach the player, forcing the player to flee. There is a save and restore feature, and all commands are via VERB NOUN entry.</p>",

The player does battle with hordes of dragons who breath large fireballs towards the player.

The player navigates a field of toadstools, and tries to shoot and destroy the colorpedes that approach from the top of the screen. Colorpedes move horizontally across the screen until they hit an obstacle, move down 1 row, and reverse direction. The player must contend with the bouncing bug that moves about the bottom of the screen, the beetle which falls from the top of the screen, and the stinger that travels across the screen creating poisoned mushrooms. The player starts with 3 shooters, and a new shooter is awarded every 10,000 points. The player proceeds to a more difficult stage when all colorpedes are destroyed.</p>",

As dots are collected, they transform into angled barriers, which allow the dots to move in only 2 directions. Other barriers allow the player to move in only straight lines. Flashing enemy monsters prowl the maze. The player starts with 3 lives, and a life is lost if they run into a monster or run out of time to complete the level. There are 3 levels of timed difficulty and 9 levels of enemy difficulty.</p>",

It is clear now that the Controllers are able to manipulate the human will. Somehow the shuttle must shield you from this. You cannot leave the shuttle! Are there others who know what you do? There things you must find out and if any way possible destroy the Controllers. </p>\n<p>Played from within the capsule, all commands and directions are graphically displayed on the right of the screen. The player has limited fuel and battery power. Fuel is used for movement, and can be found during exploration. The shuttle also has a power supply, which is used to control the ship's flashlights. Gas, power, and other items can be found during exploration. The player can pick up and drop items, and there is a map of visited locations. There is also a save/restore feature.</p>",

Each player starts at a randomized position in a large user-defined map. The goal is to explore sectors and colonize planets. Some sectors contain trading posts, which allow the player to purchase flagships, fighters, base kits, and scanners. Base kits allow the player to establish new bases, which generate credits each turn. Fighters can be used to protect bases, and scanners allow the investigation of adjacent sectors. The player warps to different sectors to establish bases. If the player encounters a sector with another player's base, they can declare war and attempt to conquer the base with fighters. Each player has a limited number of moves per turn.</p>",

Every 5th landing will be promoted to a higher cargo class with higher fuel consumption. </p>\n<p>The player's cargo ship can be rotated 90 degrees left and right, and can apply thrust. This can be used to slow the ship and land carefully at the designated site. The player has limited fuel, and it's game over if they leave the play field, crash into the ground, run out of fuel, or leave the planet.</p>",

Victory is achieved with destruction of their reactor.</p>\n<p>Played from a top-down perspective, the player's bug can move in the 4 cardinal directions, and fire directly forwards. Endless streams of bugs flow out of bug creator rooms. The player can enter object rooms, and can acquire a single key or missiles. Missiles can be used to destroy barriers, while keys can unlock specific doors. Transport rooms move the player to a different location in the maze. </p>\n<p>There are 4 levels of difficulty, and the player starts with 5 lives. There are a total of 6 levels, and upon reaching a new level, the player can restart at that level.</p>",

Cities were obliterated to make room for fields. , and the human survivors were placed in special prisons. </p>\n<p>Earth's only remaining hope is a secret defense base hidden in some hills. The people working at the base have developed the ultimate space craft, one which is capable of flying in a planet's atmosphere as well as the vacuum of space. You have been assigned to be the pilot of this craft. Your mission is to bring a device capable of saving Earth to Dracoz. </p>\n<p>The player controls a large ship on the right side of the screen, which can move vertically and fire to the left.

Special events such as alien invasions, missile strikes, and meteor showers occur, which change the composition of the dangers. The player progresses through stages with more enemies, and there are 3 levels of difficulty.</p>\n<p>Every 25,000 points, the player enters the laser trench, where the perspective changes to behind the craft.

Because of the unfamiliar surroundings of the hotel room, the dream quickly turns into Marty's Nightmare! The rows of booths turn into an engulfing maze with CoCo users transformed into CoCo 3 and mouse. The users are now trying to hunt down Marty for answers to their never ending questions. Your job is to help Marty see every booth in this nightmare before it is time for his seminar.</p>\n<p>The player navigates through a maze trying to pick up all the dots before a timer runs out. The player can pick up coffee, which temporarily speeds up the movement. If the player encounters a computer mouse or keyboard, they can't pick up more dots until they pick up a disk or memory chip. SRB tokens give the player another 30 seconds to complete the maze. After completing a maze, the player enters a new challenge.</p>",

There was a curse on the caves, forcing all who enter to go deeper until they perished. Due to an error in a time machine, you were sent back to this age in the form of a bat.</p>\n<p>The player tries to navigate a small bat through an endless cavern filled with stalactites and stalagmites, while trying to eat red and blue bugs, while avoiding deadly yellow bugs. The bat moves at a set rate, and the player flaps the wings to move the bat up and down. The player has 3 lives, and there are 8 levels of difficulty.</p>",

The player assigns the position where a ray will be fired into the grid, and will be shown where the ray exits the grid. If the ray directly hits an object, it is absorbed. If the ray travels beside a object, it is deflected 90 degrees. The player is shown on the screen where the ray exits. The player must flag the position where the reflecting items are located. After all positions have been flagged, the player can check their answers. The player is awarded points based upon the number of correct answers, and how many rays are used.</p>",

It is a peaceful kingdom with a just king on the throne, a good economy, and happy people. One day an evil wizard arrives at an odd, abandoned fortress outside the kingdom, called Castle Zhagwar. He wants to rule Lithana, so begins transforming entire forests into gigantic armies of goblins to attack the kingdom. The king sends a decree throughout the kingdom requesting help defeating the wizard. Finally, after many weeks, a strong, yet unskilled woodcutter named Gwydion appears to take on the quest.</p>\n<p>The controls a small character who can move horizontally, jump, climb ladders, and duck. On each level, the player tries to collect gold and the key, and bring the key to the door to move to the next level. The player has limited life, which is lost by falling or touching enemies. If the player jumps onto a ladder, it breaks and is lost permanently. As time passes, life begins to decrease, but randomly discovered healing elixirs can restore health. The ultimate goal is to reach the wizard and defeat him.</p>",

In the catacomb stage, the player moves through a series of very tight caverns trying to pick up fuel blocks. The total fuel is displayed at the right of the screen. The player must avoid the enemies that move in the hallways. Once the player thinks they have gathered enough fuel, they choose to enter a spaceflight stage, where they can move horizontally, and partially forwards on the screen. During this stage, the player can fire forwards to destroy or avoid enemies. Small amounts of fuel can additionally be picked up in space. The goal is to collect enough fuel in the catacombs to fly far enough in the spaceflight stage to return to the mothership.</p>",

Early the next morning, you are awoken to find out that the Golden Orange had been stolen. To solve the mystery, the player must review files on the Manor's residents: George, Eliza, and Melinda Chatwin, the lawyer Larry Lowdown, and the maid Susan Walker. The player can investigate the different rooms of the residence looking for clues. After gathering clues, the player must accuse the correct resident of the crime. Each game is randomized.</p>",

At the beginning of the game, each player is given a number of cards containing locations, weapons, and perpetrators. The cards no player possesses are the true crime. The player rolls dice to move between rooms, and in each room the player queries their opponent what cards they have. The player can only ask about the room they are in. Once the player has determined the true aspects of the crime, they can guess, and will win or lose the game based upon their guess.</p>",

And one of the ways to keep it cheap, is to ship by sea. You work at a Chinese cargo port, making sure containers are properly loaded onto freighters waiting to ship goods. </p>\n<p>Each freighter can carry 8 containers. Containers are placed from the crane atop the screen, and can be placed in 9 separate positions. The container is always placed in the lowest possible empty cargo slot. There are 4 different color-coded weights of containers. If too much weight is placed on the front or back of the ship, it will sink and the game is over. If a container is placed on the bridge of a ship, the ship is destroyed. A perfectly balanced ship gives bonus points, with the heaviest loads in the center, and the lightest loads on the periphery. The crane can only hold a container so long before dropping it, and this time reduces as the game progresses. When is ship is fully loaded, it sails out to sea, and a new empty ship takes a place in the loading dock.</p>",

It is up to you to attempt this perilous deed.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of each game, the player is randomly given attributes in strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution, hit points, gold pieces, and armour class. Before entering the Dragon's dungeon, the player can purchase weapons, armour, food, and projectiles. Dungeons are explored from 1st person perspective, and the player does combat with enemies. The player can return to town to resupply by climbing up the starting ladder. The player can also find secret doors and open chests.</p>",

A number of enemies cycle in front of the players, and fire towards the bottom of the screen. Numerous shields offer protection, and the players must fire between these shields to destroy enemies. If a player takes 3 hits, it's game over for that player. The L and R by the scores at the top of the screen indicated the left and right player; this indicates both which joystick port and which side of the playfield the player starts at.</p>",

Papa Smurf barely had time to use his magic before they were all found. Luckily, Papa had three magic diamonds that he used to make the village invisible. Gargamell wasn't very smart, so he left the area. Things were fine for a few days, until a really bad storm swept through the village. Strong winds carried the three diamonds away to an unknown cave. It would only be a matter of time before Gargamell would find the village again, so Hefty Smurf bravely volunteered to retrieve the smurf diamonds before it was too late. The next morning, Hefty sets out to find the diamonds.</p>\n<p>The player controls a smurf who moves laterally, and jumps between platforms and climb ladders. The smurf enters new screens by moving off the side or top of the screen, but if they move off the bottom of the screen without using a ladder they lose a life. The goal on each level is to discover the hidden diamond. It's game over if the player loses 3 lives.</p>",

You are tasked with exploring the dungeon and battling sea creatures in a quest to find the sword of the Merman Andon. This sword is needed to kill the Kraken. </p>\n<p>At the beginning of each game, the player rolls a random character, equipment, and stats. Each turn, the player can move through the passageways and rooms of the dungeon. A map is provided to guide the player. Each turn, the player encounters an enemy that they can fight or run from.

Unfortunately, your battalion runs into a Panzer division at one bridge. After a short battle, your battalion retreats. In the confusion, you become separated from the battalion, finding yourself at the far end of the bridge. Looking back across the bridge, you see the German tanks start up to pursue your fleeing battalion. After finding an abandoned mortar hidden in the bushes, you prepare to meet the enemy. </p>\n<p>The player controls artillery at the left of a bridge, which can only fire between 90 and 45 degrees towards an incoming tank. The tank drives towards the player, and the goal is to lob an artillery shell onto the tank. Tanks approach one at a time, and each tank approaches more quickly. The player can not move their turret or fire while a shell is in the air. If the tank reaches the end of the bridge, the player loses a life.</p>",

When the player moves along a pathway they have already cleared of dots, they leave a small trail of blue dots behind them. The player loses a life when touched by a ghost, and it's game over when 3 lives are lost.</p>",

Gravity continuously pulls the ship towards the bottom of the screen. A single alien ship moves about the screen, and the player tries to shoot this down. The player has limited fuel, but can resupply by landing on the flat landing pad at the bottom of the screen. The game tracks how many enemy ships have been destroyed and the number of player ships lost. If the player flies off the top of the screen the level resets. The player starts with 5 ships, and a ship is lost by hitting the bottom of the screen or an alien vessel.</p>",

Each unit of time covers 1 month of game play, and different weather conditions are present each month. All German and Soviet units are displayed graphically on the screen. Cities can be displayed with the country currently in control. Each unit gets limited movement points per turn, and each unit has individual strength points. </p>\n<p>Combat occurs when German forces are moved near a Soviet unit, and total losses are displayed after combat. Air attacks can be used to reinforce player attacks by asking for airflotte assistance prior to troop movement. Supply, terrain, weather, air power, and blitz affect combat results. Supply points are distributed to all forces, and determine fighting prowess. Supply points are determined by cities captured and surviving until the Spring, while supply points are used by all troop actions and movements. </p>\n<p>Game play continues until all Russian cities are captured, total strength of units falls below 75, or the game reaches January 1944. Victory is achieved if all Russian cities are captured.</p>",

The player starts in the upper left, while the Volsungs start in the lower right. Each uninhabited planet can consist of 8 types of star systems, where the player can start either an agricultural, energy, mining, or industrial colony. The player can create 4 types of space ships.</p>\n<p>Each turn consists of a meteor shower phase, where all ships in an area of the galaxy are wiped out. Total production is displayed, and the player can earn credits which are used to purchase new vessels. Groups of ships can be moved during the movement phase. Each turn, the player can scan surrounding star systems, and systems can be colonized by moving an explorer ship to that location. The player then chooses which type of colony to form, and can only create 1 colony per turn. </p>\n<p>Combat occurs by moving two opposing vessels adjacent to each other. Multiple ships can be brought to bear at once. </p>\n<p>There are 3 levels of difficulty which determine the number of game play turns. The player receives a game play ranking at the end of all available turns.</p>",

Each turn, the player supplies movement and commands for each unit. Units can fire on enemy units, and can also shoot mortars instead of movement. Units can also radio for naval barrages, or call intelligence to help loate nearby Japanese units. The player has a limited number of Seabee units, engineering crew which can be used to clear jungle or construct airfields. Once per turn, the player can provide reinforcements to a remaining unit. American troops received a continued rate of supplies and supply ships, but these must be protected by constructing airbases to allow air defense of supplies. If supply levels drop too low, combat effectiveness of troops is gravely reduced.</p>\n<p>Air operations must be coordinated with ground troops, and the player can launch search, interdiction, and cover operations to help locate Japanese forces, attack forces, or prevent enemy attack respectively. These can only be called every several turns dependent upon airfield status. Game play continues until all Japanese camps are captured or field strength falls below allowable level. The player receives a final victory score at the end of game play.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Kamikaze</em> is a 1-player strategy wargame for the TRS-80 CoCo.</p>\n<p>A game of naval combat between Japanese and American aircraft carriers during World War II. Game play occurs between January 01, 1945 and January 08, 1945. Each day is divided into 4 turns set during daylight hours from 0600 - 1800. </p>\n<p>The game starts from the bridge view, where the player can view the status of their two aircraft carriers <em>Dolphin</em> and <em>Seminole</em>, and their fighter, dive bomber, and torpedo bomber allotment. The player can view their ships under the flag menu. Map views the gridded map screen, target examines contacts made using radar and search, ready prepares planes for air cover and attack, repair allow fixes to the carriers, and convert allows moving aircraft between carriers. </p>\n<p>Most game play occurs from the map view. Radar is used when the player activates the map, and looks for nearby enemy ships and planes. In search, the player sends out aircraft and can evaluate up to 4 squares per turn. The player also can send out 3 picket gunboats to look for Japanese craft each turn, but these are at risk of being destroyed by Japanese air attack. The player institutes air attacks from this menu, and can send any readied aircraft to attack enemy ships within range. Fighter craft can be used to defend from incoming bombers and enemy fighters. At the end of air combat the player can move their fleet.</p>\n<p>During the Japanese attack, the player can be attacked by Japanese kamikaze fighters. The player enters an arcade sequence where they control the main gun of their defending craft, and try to shoot down incoming Japanese planes. The player can take a limited number of hits before their ships are sunk. Surface attacks occur if the player's fleet directly encounters the Japanese fleet, and the player can either choose to sacrifice one of their vessels to cover their escape or directly engage in combat with the more heavily armed Japanese force.</p>",

Units automatically engage in combat when adjacent, and artillery can be aimed and fired at distant troops. </p>\n<p>French troops gain higher morale and combat prowess when near Napoleon due to his high influence. If Napoleon is lost, the player immediately loses. French units gain combat power when attacking from the north, and to a lesser extent from the east or west. Any units positioned in rough terrain will receive a defensive bonus. Cavalry units can be sent on patrol to view enemy troop movement further up screen, but there is a risk they will not return from their scouting mission.</p>\n<p>Two Additional corps can be called in during game play, and the probability of success depends on objectives captured during the expedition. The player can impede enemy troop reinforcements by capturing the objective cities of: Ligny, Nivelles, St. Jean, and finally Waterloo.

A robot species so advanced that man is inferior to his own creation. Guided by their infallible logic, the Robotrons conclude: the human race is inefficient, and therefore must be destroyed.</p>\n<p>You are a mutant human, who by some freak of nature has the ability to shoot energy pulses from his body in eight different directions! Your job is to save humanity from their own creation. The player can move and fire in any of eight directions. You get thrown in a room with various evil baddies strewn about, you've got to kill all the susceptible robots while at the same time finding some way to grab humans and avoid death. Indestructible hulk robots can not be killed, and they seek out and kill humans. Quarks produce tanks, which fire projectiles that bounce around the screen. Brains can reprogram humans into progs, which become enemy units.</p>",

The rows of aliens begin at the right of the screen, and the player controls a laser cannon at the left of the screen. The goal is to earn points by shooting the aliens before they can land. The aliens march back and forth, and each time the end of the screen is reached they will drop one row closer to the bottom. Shoot them all to move to the next harder level. If any aliens reach the bottom of the screen it's game over. A flying saucer intermittently moves across the screen for bonus points. Three shields offer protection from alien fire, but also block the player's shots. The player begins with 5 laser cannons, and it's game over if all are destroyed.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Spellbound: A Dungeons &amp; Dragons Adventure</em> is a 1-player roleplaying game for the TRS-80 CoCo.</p>\n<p>The powerful Archwizard is marshalling his forces of evil in the dungeon beneath the Town of Midgard. The forces of light are represented by Ymiro, the leader of the local temple, who strives to gather adventurers to defeat the evil. </p>\n<p>At the beginning of each adventure, the player can access numerous locations of Midgard via the menu. The Adventurer's Guild creates new characters. The player creates a party of 6 adventurers from 5 classes: fighter, thief, wizard, priest, or paladin and 4 races: elf, human, dwarf, or gnome, and rolls for statistics. The Unicorn Tavern serves as the meeting place for these adventurers where a party can be gathered. The Library provides information and back story on the game world. </p>\n<p>Once a party has been gathered, they can purchase equipment at Elmo's Trading Post, rest and recover at the Green Dragon Inn, purchase healing and level advancement at the Temple of Ymiro, or finally choose to enter the dungeon beneath Midgard. </p>\n<p>Once entering the dungeon, game play occurs from a first person perspective in a wire frame maze. The player encounters parties of monsters, where the characters can use items, parry attacks, run away, cast spells, or fight if close enough to an enemy. Each enemy has distance, and can approach or run away from monsters. Experience points and gold from combat can be used to level up the characters.</p>",

Played on a 12 x 9 board, each turn the player can choose 1 of 5 randomly selected positions on the grid. </p>\n<p>The player can establish a new outpost by selecting a coordinate in the middle of nowhere. A new shipping company is established if a location adjacent to an outpost or a star is selected. This will reward the player 5 new stocks in the company, and each turn the player can buy more stocks in an established company. If a position is selected between two adjacent companies, they will merge under the name of the larger company, and the held stocks will increase in value. A company grows, and stocks prices increase in value, if a position adjacent to an established company is selected. After all spots are chosen, the player who has accumulated the most money is the winner.</p>",

These plants have a reputation of being able to survive in all climates, and in fact are supposed to grow at an incredible rate. The Federation is desperate! If Earth's food source is not replaced soon, the Federation will have to evacuate all animal and Human life. Your mission is to go to the planet Zephyr and obtain the seed of these plants and return to Earth.

The hive consists of 6 concentric counterclockwise rotating circles, each with a number of breaks that the bee catcher can move in and out of as they also rotate counterclockwise within the hive. Also within the hive are a number of guard bees that move at different speeds within the rings. At higher levels, guard bees can move between rings and counterclockwise. The player starts with 6 lives and loses a life if they contact a guard bee or run out of time. When all honey bees are collected, the player advances to the next level.</p>",

Things haven't looked too good on this trip as the food supply was mistakenly swapped with that of a swine transport. Things turn worse when a siren sounds. The ship has collided with an asteroid and everyone is heading to their escape pods. Unfortunately, this ship is outfitted with Personal Escapemods Version 1 by Fat Chance, Inc., the biggest hunk of junk ever put together.</p>\n<p>The game window is divided into a large front view, and 4 separate panels that provide top/bottom and side views of the vessel. The screens will show the location of dreaded Hugons, so the player can try to avoid them. The escape pod has limited fuel which is drained by acceleration. The player's shields take damage by getting rammed by Hugons, and if they take too much damage the ship is destroyed.</p>",

Each year, the player must allocate resources to maintenance and growth of their grain production, as well as their fishing fleet. The goal is to promote population growth by adequately managing resources. Rats pose constant danger to grain stores, and losses can be minimized by maintaining a healthy population of ferrets. Guards can help protect fishing fleets and the population. The player has to raise taxes to pay for their expenditures. The player can enhance their city by purchasing fishing boats, markets, armories, temples, adding onto their hall, and more acreage. If the population is overly exploited they may revolt, causing great damage to resources and infrastructure.</p>",

Each time the player travels or visits an informant it uses the player's limited time and money. If the player can't identify Dr. Ockywoky and open the safe in time it's game over.

There are also energy capsules to gather to power up your smart bomb that damages everything hostile on screen. Apart from lesser alien vessels, you will be encountering boss aliens with more complex attack patterns, also requiring a lot more damage to take out.\nThe game features a point system and high scores will be saved onto the high score table.</p>",

        "description": "<p>You are an emoji. You find yourself confined in some sort of bottomless pit, endlessly scrolling as you fall downwards. How long can you last?\n<em>Water Fall</em> is a simple arcade game with just one character, your protagonist, with randomly generated scrolling platforms and colored pellets. Your goal is to always land on a platform, avoid the pits and move fast enough so that you won't be caught between a platform and the top of the screen. Also, collect as many pellets as you can along the way. Pellets come in different colors each with its corresponding point value. Additionally, every second or so that passes awards you with points, so the longer you survive, the higher the score. The game gradually picks up speed and platform patterns become more challenging, culminating in an unavoidable game over.\nThe control mechanics are extremely simple, there's no jump button and you can only move left or right to land on platforms below.\nVisually, there are a couple of notable features. The game runs on low resolution semigraphics and there's some (Choppy) backdrop parallax scrolling. When it comes to audio, the game only supports the Tandy Speech and Sound Cartridge if your computer is equipped with one, playing a simple tune and a few phrases in synthesized voice, e.g. when you pick up a pellet the game announces aloud the number of points made.</p>",

Additionally, this release incorporates a different screen mode to fix its predecessor's incompatibility with the Tandy CoCo 3.\nThe gameplay is unchanged: You control a particle and move across a grid, collecting green and orange particles. Your sprite is constantly moving and can only be made to take left of right turns with your joystick, there's no direct directional control. Colliding with the harmful white particles, laser beams and the top or bottom of the screen causes damage. Collecting an orange particle will enable you for a few seconds to chase and consume a white particle for an energy boost. Once you pick up all, you move on to a more challenging level.</p>",

Millions of people have undergone surgery as a means to become mental superhumans. As it turns out, these devices are actually a method of mind control for the corporations to affect how people think and act. You are a gunman who's had enough of that. Your job is to infiltrate the headquarters of one such corporation and assassinate the chairman and orchestrator of this conspiracy.</p>\n<p><em>Gate Crasher</em> is a first-person shooter, not unlike <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Wolfenstein+3D\">Wolfenstein 3D</a>. You wander through the halls and corridors of  a five-story office building, armed with a firearm, taking out armed henchmen in black suits and making sure not to hurt innocent programmers (Dressed in white shirts). There are bullets and first aid kits strewn about the complex, to replenish your ammo and health. Also, there are electronically locked doors whose code must be decoded (In some sort of puzzle minigame) and computer terminals to destroy before you can move to the next floor. Technically, the game features 360 degree motion and digitized sound effects.</p>",

So much celebration, in fact, that the overthrown king's stock of ale was depleted, and the player was forced to rummage through the castle for more.  Upon discovering a staff with indecipherable writings etched on it, the player brings it back to their inebriated companions.  As the companions drunkenly play with the wand, the player finds themself transported to the dark dungeon deep within the bowels of the castle.  The player must now escape from the Dungeon of Denna.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of each new game, the player rolls a character's strength, agility, physique, and alertness.  Statistics determine the player's hit points, combat factor, defense factor, damage modifier, and number of attacks.  The player can equip one item at a time, and has eight body parts with individual strength: head, neck, left arm, right arm, chest, abdomen, left leg, and right leg.  </p>\n<p>While navigating the dungeon, the player can only see the area immediately around them.  The player encounters doors which can be trapped, and may be one-way.  There are also secret doors that appear identical to walls.  The player further encounters stairs that allow them to move up or down levels.  Items can be found throughout the dungeon that can be picked up or dropped.  Furniture can be encountered, which can be looked in, on, under, or behind for items.  Weapons can be wielded or unequipped.  Spells can also be picked up and read.</p>\n<p>When in combat, the player is provided with monsters' hit points, number of attacks, combat, and defensive factors.  Each monster has eight areas to attack with individual hit points and probability to hit.  To kill a monster, total hit points or the hit points for a specific area must be reduced to zero. As the player defeats monsters, their experience and combat aptitude increases.</p>",
