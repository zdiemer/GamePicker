        "description": "<p><em>Sev Zero</em> combines tower defense-style strategic base building with fast-action shooting mayhem. The player needs to defend the planet by holding off the alien onslaught using an expansive arsenal of destructive firepower. While playing players frequently teleport between their ship and the ground: start off in tower defense mode to assess your surroundings and tower placements, then beam down to help blow your enemies away in face-to-face combat.</p>\n<p>The game also has a companion app called <em>Sev Zero: Air Support</em>. Using a tablet, and playing alongside the game on the Amazon Fire TV for instance, the game expands to a multiplayer, multiscreen cooperative experience where a friend can help repel the invasion by firing missiles, freezing enemies, deploying explosive decoys and more. On the tablet the player can also time a supercharge ability, granting invulnerability and massive firepower bonuses to the player on the TV in the middle of a firefight.</p>",

He can also stick to wooden surface, even on ceilings, slide down on jade which makes him really fast, and ricochet on metal plates which improves damage he deals to enemies.</p>\n<p>You can control the camera position using the Fire Phone camera, control movement of To-Fu using two-finger tap and drag Tofu to jump on longer distances. The game has different areas with multiple levels each. The last one is made of challenges that can be unlocked or bought. Each area ends with final boss; defeating him unlocks the next area.</p>\n<p>The game offers an in-game shop where you can buy additional skins and levels through in-app purchases.
