This game belongs to the first series, also known as the <strong>\"Silver Series\"</strong>. Originally Ball should have been called <strong>Acrobat</strong>, hence the serial name AC-01.</p>\n<p>The small character in the game has to juggle two balls, moving his arms from right to left. Although slow at first, the pace progressively goes faster, challenging the player's reflexes and sense of rhythm. In game B, the player has to juggle three balls instead of two. Failing to catch one ball will have a \"crush\" appear on the screen, automatically ending the game.</p>",

The pet starts off as an egg, and will progress through several stages of life until it dies or reproduces. Depending on the creature's gender and how well it is cared for, it may develop into a number of different forms as it grows older.</p>\n<p>This Tamagotchi release is the first one to allow multiplayer, which is accomplished by connecting two devices via the infrared port on top. The two Tamagotchi pets will then either exchange gifts, or play a competitive mini-game against each other. Afterwards, the two will be registered into one another's friend lists. The more two specific pets connect with one another, the more affection will build between them. Two adults of the opposite gender may fall in love and produce offspring if they reach a high enough affection level. At that point, the adult creatures will disappear, leaving the players to care for the new babies.</p>",

Originally Vermin would have been called \"Mogura Tataki\" (Whacking Moles), hence the serial name MT-03.</p>\n<p>Designed to play like the popular \"Whack-A-Mole\" game from the arcades it's the player's mission to whack the moles coming from the bottom part of the screen appearing in 5 different spots. The goal is hitting them on the head as fast as possible, before the moles run away and passing the player, resulting in a \"MISS\". Failing three times will end up in a \"Game Over\". The controls are simple movements to the left and right, taking into consideration the wingspan of the on-screen character. Hammering the moles is done automatically when their heads appear under your hammer.</p>",

The gameplay is similar to other Tamagotchis, but with a few twists that reflect the pet's nature as an angel. One such feature is Angel Power, or AP, which increases when the pet is fed, and can decrease if the pet is neglected or the player fails to administer praise at the proper times. AP helps determine which evolution path the pet will take. In this version, there is no discipline option, but the pet must be praised whenever the player notices it praying.</p>\n<p>The device includes sound and motion sensors. At times, the pet may go for a stroll, during which time it will disappear from the screen and be unavailable for interaction. Although the pet will eventually return on its own, it can be called back early by simultaneously using the praise option and activating one of the sensors. The motion sensor is also used to scare away bats, which occasionally appear to steal the pet's food during meal times.</p>",

The player needs to wait for the two to each lift a sign reading a random number from 1 to 9. In single-player, if your player character shows a <strong>higher</strong> number than the CPU's, then you must push the <strong>hit</strong> button. If yours is the <strong>lower</strong> number however, then you must push the <strong>dodge/flee</strong> button. If you manage to hit your opponent before he could dodge or avoid his attack, you will score points. Game B is used for playing against a fellow person instead of a CPU.</p>",

The normal care options, such as feeding the pet and cleaning up after it, are present, and there are several options unique to this Tamagotchi as well. Occasionally the pet will be threatened by a predator, which the player must scare away by activating the device's motion sensor. In addition, the life cycle of the pet includes a cocoon stage. During this time, the only care option is temperature, which needs to be monitored throughout the day and adjusted as necessary. The cocoon's temperature can rise and fall without the player's input, and can potentially kill the pet if it remains too hot or too cold for an extended amount of time. The average temperature maintained during this stage influences the pet's evolution path.</p>",

When the lion escaped the guard would be seen running and climbing on top of the tree.</p>\n<p>A vaguely similar concept to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/86580/game-watch-gold-manhole/\">Manhole</a>, where the goal was to protect pedestrians on <strong>two</strong> levels, Lion requires simultaneous interaction with 6 open cages with two guards, armed with only chairs. The chair is simply used to push the animal back, whilst the cage stays and keeps open. In game B three lions, instead of the two lions in game A, need to be dealt with. The game can be played by two players simultaneously, with each controlling one side.</p>",

Occasionally the pet will be threatened by a predator, which the player must scare away by activating the device's motion sensor. In addition, the player needs to pay attention to the water quality. The water becomes dirtier over time, and needs to be cleaned periodically in order to keep the pet healthy.</p>\n<p>This Tamagotchi is one of the more difficult ones to raise to adulthood, due to it requiring very diligent care.

In Game A, a single turtle, middle one, will not submerge and stays on top of the water. In Game B all turtles will dive.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Super Game Pod!</em> is a non-screen handheld aimed at younger audience which features six mini-games which require some thinking and pressing the right button to proceed to next question and earn sound of success. Just like a handheld, the device contains left and right button, while in place of the screen there are various buttons for various games. Buttons marked with numbers from 1-10 and shapes are used for memory-related games. On the right side are rock-paper-scissors buttons and at the bottom are six buttons which launch selected mini-game.</p>\n<p>Pressing the game buttons without starting a mini-game will just yield in a female voice telling you which buttons you have pressed. Otherwise, that same female voice is used in all the mini-games to tell you what to do and do not.</p>\n<p>Six included mini-games are:</p>\n<p><strong>Migi, Hidari</strong></p>\n<p>The simplest game which tell you to press or not to press left and/or right button. By hearing \"press right button\" or \"do not press left button\" the player has to press the corresponding button or remain idle until next request. Only left and right buttons are used for this mini-game.</p>\n<p><strong>Kazu no Yaritori</strong></p>\n<p>The voice lists several different objects (i.e. tomatoes and apples) and the player must answer the total sum of them. Buttons labeled from 1-10 are used for this mini-game.</p>\n<p><strong>Ichi no Kioku</strong></p>\n<p>This is a memory card game. On the buttons from 1 to 10 are five pairs randomly assigned. Pressing button will tell you what is placed there. For example, pressing number 5 may tell you there's a apple there, and pressing 8 may hold an orange. Connecting all the pairs results in a success.</p>\n<p><strong>Suuji no Kioku</strong></p>\n<p>This game requires you to remember the right sequence of numbers. At first you have to press 3 numbers you hear in the right order, then 4, and so on. Missing to press the right number in the sequence will repeat the same sequence until you get it right.</p>\n<p><strong>Katachi no Hayaoshi</strong></p>\n<p>This mini-game uses same ten button which have number and various shapes on them. It requires the player to quickly press all the shapes that match the given condition. For example, if the voice says \"press all the shapes that are not round\", then pressing stars, rectangles and triangles would be satisfactory.</p>\n<p><strong>Otodashi Janken</strong></p>\n<p>A slightly irregular game of rock-paper-scissors where the goal isn't always to beat the given selection. Based on the request, the player will have to select rock, paper or scissors to either win or loose if that is required.</p>",

His task is to go back and forth between all four spots and release the concrete before anything is spilled. Failure to do so will result in dumping of said concrete on the truckers waiting to make their delivery. To reach the different levers Mario must travel between floors via elevators, which must be taken carefully to avoid Mario falling off.

A Pok\u00e9mon from one of those two games can be sent to the <em>Pok\u00e9walker</em>, where it will gain experience points from the steps the player takes in the real world. A currency called watts also builds up as steps are taken, and can be used to purchase one-time use items that offer a chance to find an item or catch a wild Pok\u00e9mon. Three items and three captured Pok\u00e9mon can be stored on the device, and will be sent back to the Nintendo DS game the next time the <em>Pok\u00e9walker</em> communicates with it. The Pok\u00e9mon and items that can be found depend on the location selected when a Pok\u00e9mon is sent from the Nintendo DS. Two courses are available at the start, and more can be unlocked by accumulating a certain number of watts, performing a specific task in <em>HeartGold</em> or <em>SoulSilver</em>, or receiving a special Wonder Card from an official event.</p>",

Instead of controlling Donkey Kong, the player controls Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck is standing on the side instead of Mario. Compared to the mockery Mario displayed in Donkey Kong Circus, Donald isn't mocking Mickey. On the contrary, he jumps as if he was panicked and worried about Mickey's well-being. It's concept and gameplay are the same as Donkey Kong Circus</p>\n<p>The product code of this game <strong>MK-95</strong> and the sixth game in this series <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/95857/game-watch-panorama-screen-donkey-kong-circus/\">Donkey Kong Circus</a>, codenamed <strong>MK-96</strong>, seemed to have their code names switched, since MK (= Mickey Mouse) and DC (= Donkey Kong Circus), but this isn't the case.</p>",

System: Boxing</em> is the first of three released games in the eight series of Game &amp; Watch games published by Nintendo, also known as the Micro Vs. System Series. This series allowed for two players to battle against one another on the same screen. The Micro Vs. series boasted a wider screen and the innovative storage feature of the two small joy-pads and their wires inside the shell of the system. The US version of the Micro Vs. Boxing game was renamed to <strong>Punch-Out!!</strong> using the popularity of the eponymous <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/64010/punch-out/\">arcade version</a>.</p>\n<p>Players will have to fight during nine rounds of 1 minute each, to claim victory. The up and down directions are used to set the height of your strike or blocking stances, whereas the rest of the D-pad will allow you to move around the ring. A point system, like an energy meter, will give you real time information about the health and shape of your boxer. In order to balance fights between two players with different skill levels, it's possible to set each fighter's amount of energy beforehand.</p>",

The map has been shredded to pieces and attached to balloons spread across the levels. One has to use your jet pack to collect as many pieces as possible, whilst avoiding sparks. These will have you fall into the seas below when touched. The \"Eject\" button controls the altitude of the jet pack. The more you push it, the higher you will go. Whereas, if you don't push it at all, your character will be sent into a free fall. Bonus stages are added, allowing you to grab extra balloons during a short period of time. Rocks in the water grant you a temporarily minute of rest. Every 8 levels a boss encounter ensues, where you have to dodge and defeat the enemy. Over 200 levels are available, which can be completed by collecting 25 balloons. The \"Game Over\" screen system, after 3 lives lost, isn't present anymore. One can continue indefinitely as long as you score at least 100 points between two failures.

The system has a directional pad and two face buttons similar to Nintendo's Game Boy, as well as two switches on the top for power and sound. It's powered by a small 180mAh battery which can be recharged using a standard Micro-USB connector on the bottom of the device.</p>\n<p>The game is a simple but fully-featured rendition of Tetris based on the official Tetris guidelines. The d-pad is used to move your Tetrimino to the left and right, as well as perform a soft drop or a hard drop. The two face buttons are used to rotate your Tetrimino clockwise or counterclockwise. The game has a total of fifteen levels of difficulty which like other version of the game simply increase the speed at-which the Tetrimos fall as you clear lines.</p>",

It also has a crossword helper function, anagram solver and a games mode.   </p>\n<p>The display is nineteen character wide black-on-grey in a dot-matrix style with each character being seven dots high and five dots wide. When the device needs to display lengthy text it scrolls across the display right to left.</p>\n<p>Games mode is selected by pressing the yellow button that looks like the five on a dice, one of four such buttons situated above the QWERTY keyboard, the games button is the second from the right. The games available are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hangman</strong>: the game starts by letting the player select the number of characters in the word to be found, the shortest length is three characters and the longest is thirteen. The game then displays the word as a series of question marks, e.g. ??????. The player presses letters and the game either places the letter into the word or it responds with a message such as 'There is no P'. The player has nine attempts to guess the word before it's Game Over.</li>\n<li><strong>Jumble</strong>: Once again the player sets the word length but this time the game provides a jumbled word such as BBYUGR for GRUBBY and the player's task is to enter the correct, unscrambled word.</li>\n<li><strong>Word Search</strong>: After selecting a word length a word is displayed together with a number. The number shows how many words of three or more letters can be made from the original source word, it is the player's task to enter them all and as each word is entered and accepted the displayed number decreases.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The device weighs just over 50 g without its CR2032 battery and measures approximately 9.5cm x 6cm x 1.25cm.</p>",

A series of rings scroll in from left to right and the player's task is to collect them by moving Tails up/down by means of the two buttons to the right of the screen.

The player can choose between controlling a Celebrity Chef, a Social Media Star or a Fashion Designer, with a special mini game unique to each character that is used to make money and acquire more items for the character's house. The home starts off with four rooms, but can be expanded up to 32 total. Each room can be decorated with items purchased from a catalog, and it's even possible to adopt a pet. The player is also charged with keeping the girls healthy and happy by making sure they are fed, bathed and rested. However, unlike most virtual pets, the girls will not get sick or die.</p>",

Avoid getting run over by wolves, buffaloes, a horse and covered wagon and a steam locomotive.</li>\n<li>The second screen is a shootout inside the bank. One robber is taking all the money from the safe and the other is moving up and down shooting at you. There is a bank clerk moving up and down acting like a human shield, try to shoot the robber and avoid hitting the clerk. Hitting the bank clerk costs 10 points, getting hit by the robbers and you lose a life. Hit the robber 3 times to defeat him, and then the other robber takes the sack of money and flees from the bank to the final screen.</li>\n<li>The third screen at the top is a one-on-one fist fight. Try to punch the robber while blocking his blows. The player can punch and block high and low.

The game can be played either in normal mode going through all 3 screens in succession, or each of the screens can be played as an individual game. The device has a D-pad and buttons located alongside the bottom screen. The top screen can fold onto the middle screen for easy portability. There is a built-in clock and alarm function.</p>",

It's a sports themed game where you play a game of water polo, starting at the bottom screen and working his way up.

Move left and right to intercept the balls coming in from the left, right and center.</li>\n<li>In the second screen in the middle, the player has to take the ball across the pool to the opposing side, moving left and right across three lanes while avoiding the opposing players.</li>\n<li>In the third screen at the top, the ball is on the opposing side and the player has to score a goal in the other team's goal. The ball is thrown from left to right and the player can move left and right to thrown the ball in the goal and not into the hands of the goalie.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each screen has its own miss counter, meaning that in the bottom screen you can get max. three goals but this is separate from losing the ball three times in second screen, or missing three times in the third screen. The game can be played either in normal mode going through all 3 screens in succession, or each of the screens can be played as an individual game. The device has a D-pad and buttons located alongside the bottom screen. The top screen can fold onto the middle screen for easy portability. There is a built-in clock and alarm function.</p>",

The device's primary controls consist of a circle shaped 4-way directional pad, and a second similarly shaped pad that acts as two buttons. In the game the player controls Leonardo and must rescue April who has been kidnapped and tied up by Shredder. The game has three game modes. In mode 1, the player must first fight a bunch of enemies until they are allowed into the water. Once in the water they have past two obstacles to retrieve a key and then swim back. After that they can walk up to April and unlock her restrains to win the game.</p>\n<p>Mode 2 follows the same basic formula as game one, except now there is a shield around April which the player has to destroy with bombs. The bombs are located where the key is, and the player must collect the bomb and bring it to the shield were it will explode. They then need to do that a second time to completely destroy the shield and allow the player to collect the key. Additionally, the player can only be in the water for 10 seconds, and will lose the game if the time runs out. Game 3 is identical to game 2, except the player has to use 3 bombs instead of 2 to destroy the shield.</p>",

In the game, the player takes control of the 4 titular turtles as they fight off the Foot Clan's minions on their way to face off against Shredder. The game is controlled by using the right button to attack and the d-pad to choose the direction to attack in and to jump up and down to avoid projectiles. If the turtle the player is controlling is hit, they are out of commission and the player is forced to switch to another. If all for are out then it's game over. The game consists of 5 stages. In the first two the player fights against hordes of the Foot Clan's minions, and in the final 3 stages they face off against Bebop, Rocksteady, and finally Shredder himself.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3: Shredder's Last Stand</em> is the third of Konami's series of TMNT LCD games. The device's primary controls consist of a circle shaped 4-way directional pad on the left, and a singular button on the right. In the game the player controls the 4 titular turtles as they fight off against Shredder's minions on the streets of New York City. The game is controlled by using the d-pad to move and the right button to attack. If the turtle the player is controlling runs out of health, they are out of commission and the player is forced to switch to another. If all for are out then it's game over. The game consists of 5 stages where the player walks to the right, attacking enemies and jumping over obstacles. In the middle and the end of each stage the player faces off against a boss. Once the player reaches the end of a stage their health is restored and they're given a choice to switch to a different turtle.</p>",

The offensive team has two players who can pass, shoot and move around with the directional buttons. The added player and ability to pass is a new ability compared to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Basketball\">its predecessor</a>. The defending player can choose between three types of play (Man-to-man, zone and press). The game handles fouls, 3-second rule violations and features four game speeds. The game is played in four quarters and can include tie-breaker overtimes.</p>",

The player is presented with a 5x6 grid of lights with one central point unlit. The player's goal is to turn off all lights but one. To do this the player can select a light and make it jump over another adjacent light (horizontally, vertically or diagonally). Any light that's jumped over is turned off. The game features two difficulty modes which affect a timer that provides a time limit to solving the puzzle.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Enterprise</em> is a dedicated handheld device that combines three games and a calculator function. The device features a keypad and LED display similar to a pocket calculator, but also allows the following three games to be played:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>American Pontoon</em> - A digital version of Black Jack. The player draws cards with the goal to get as high as possible to a value of 21 without going over. The player plays against the dealer for which one of the first cards remains hidden. The game allows for more advanced rules such as insurance, splitting in case of two identical starting cards and doubling down.</li>\n<li><em>Brain Drain</em> - A <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/9137/mastermind-variants/\">Mastermind variant</a> in which the player must crack a four digit code. After each guess the player is shown the correct numbers and the numbers that are in the code but in a different position. Using logical deduction the player can try to crack the code in as few tries as possible.</li>\n<li><em>Speedway</em> - A motorcycle action racing game. The player's position on the screen indicates the speed and the player can accelerate, brake and shift lanes to avoid collisions with other motorcyclists. The goal is to reach as much distance as possible to get a highscore.</li>\n</ul>",

The device is styled like a spiral-bound notebook, one of the hallmarks of the various Blue's Clues series from the beginning. This particular version is based on the show that started airing in 2019, and features an animated pixel likeness of host Josh Dela Cruz alongside canine series mascot Blue. The top of the device features a membrane keyboard while the bottom half has an LED touchscreen that kids can draw on with the included stylus.  The notebook contains six learning games, including one activity that tasks a child with playing their own version of Blue's Clues by drawing clues on the touchscreen.</p>",

A \"super-sonar\" detector can be used to locate enemy subs, though energy is consumed when doing so. Ten points are earned for destroying an enemy sub, while the player must either avoid getting hit by enemy mines or lessen their impact by activating the protective shield. If the player's sub is hit twice by enemy mines, then the game is over.</p>\n<p>All enemies must be destroyed before the player sub's energy runs out to advance to the next level. Level 1 features 10 enemy subs, and each level features an additional 5 subs, which move increasingly faster. There are nine levels total and also support for two players to compare scores.</p>",

When a player completes a certain number of actions, their Digimon will level up and change form. Players can also participate in battles, which are instigated either by interacting with other users, by tapping the device at an NFC terminal, or online via the app. Different creatures can be added to the device via special DiM cards, purchased separately from the main unit.</p>\n<p>This version of the Vital Hero unit has a black wristband and comes with a DiM card for the character Boutmon.</p>",
