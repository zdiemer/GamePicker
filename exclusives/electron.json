The player controls his laser base down the bottom of the screen and has to shoot at the aliens moving back and forth above while avoiding their fire. To his help he has three bunkers that offer some protection from fire. In addition to the aliens' regular fire they also drop bombs that explode in mid-air, with shrapnel flying in multiple directions. There are eight different aliens and they differ in points value from ten to eighty. In addition to these there's also a mothership that occasionally passes by at the top of the screen and is worth a larger amount of points. The game can be played by one or two players and each have three lives.</p>",

The year will then be played out with graphs showing inflation, popularity and unemployment while messages show if funds are not sufficient in an area.

It's similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/93535/pirate-pedro/\">Pirate Pedro</a> from the same author but deals with division instead of addition and subtraction. The player has to answer ten division problems given by Daniel Duck. The task is to help Felicity share out bags of oats to her hungry horses. For each question the player enters how many bags each horse should get and if there is a remainder that too needs to be entered. If answering wrong an animation will show Felicity give out the correct amount of oats to the horses.</p>",

The player is on their last mission, a one-way trip to shoot down as many raiders as they can before their ship runs out of power.  Played from a 1st-person perspective, the player moves a crosshair to engage and shoot enemy vessels.  The further an enemy is away the more points awarded when destroyed.  Shooting lasers decreases the player's limited power.  It's game over when all power is lost.</p>",
