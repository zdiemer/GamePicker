        "description": "<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></p>\n<p>Programmed exclusively for the Atari 8-bit computers, <em>Gauntletak!</em> was one of the earliest \"<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Cave-flyers+and+Thrust+clones\">cave-flyer games</a>.\" It was also one of the earliest games that functioned in the shareware mode of distribution, though the word had not been coined yet, and was generally distributed on BBSes. The shareware version was named <em>Gauntlet</em>, and, though it was released a year before Atari's release of the popular coin-op arcade game by the same name, the developer opted to rename it for the paid version.</p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong>\n<em>Gauntletak!</em> is a side-view 2D shooter in which the player controls a lander-like ship in a zero-gravity cave environment, progressing through fifty screens and facing progressively more difficult enemies and situations before facing the final Kingship.</p>\n<p>Movement is similar to other lander-style games, though simplified by the lack of gravity. Pressing the joystick in any direction thrusts in that direction, with momentum maintained until either canceled by thrust in the opposite direction, or pressing the X key to cancel all motion. Meanwhile, holding down the fire button while pointing in any direction fires the ship's weapons in that direction, allowing the player to drift in one direction while firing in any other direction. The controls are simple and intuitive, without the complexity and higher learning curve involved in many other lander-type games.</p>\n<p>The core portion of the game involves avoiding and destroying a variety of enemies, including homing proximity mines, ground installations that fire all sorts of guns and missiles, and a variety of alien ships whose firepower increases over the course of the game. The alien ships have varying AI behavior, from simply pursuing the player directly to using the terrain to take cover from player fire. To succeed, the player must use the terrain as cover and avoid being detected by too many on-screen enemies at once or be swarmed and damaged excessively or destroyed.</p>\n<p>The player's ship fires direct-fire fusion bolts in a steady autofire, limited to six bolts on-screen at any given time, creating tiny explosions on impact. At the beginning of each game, the player also chooses one of three missile types, with different characteristics and tactical uses, that will be used for the entirety of that game. Missile ammunition is limited to 10, but replenishes periodically. </p>\n<p>The environment in Gauntletak! is completely destructible, and sometimes must be blown through to progress to the next screen. Beginning game options also provide an option to play the game without any landscape whatsoever.</p>\n<p>Everything in the game takes damage continuously as long as it is in contact with an explosion or some other object. The player's ship starts with 30 points of shield damage capacity, and if that shield is ever reduced to zero, the next hit will destroy it. Every screen completed increases the player's shield by 2, up to a maximum of 99, and the player receives 100 bonus points per shield point remaining at the end of every screen. Every 10,000 points, the player receives an additional 10 shield points. Thus, it is important to build up shield points in the early game so as to bring in enough points to get the 10,000-point shield bonus every one or two screens.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTEWORTHY TECHNICAL ASPECTS</strong></p>\n<p>One of the most noteworthy aspects of <em>Gauntletak!</em>, beside its sophisticated treatment of movement and intertia, was the sheer number of moving objects it can have on the screen at once -- often ten or so enemies, six of your fusion bolts and scads of enemy shots and missiles -- despite the fact that the Atari 8-bit video driver made this impossible because of its need to redraw the whole screen when even one pixel was changed. The author circumvented this limitation by programming the game in lean assembly-language code, writing his own video driver and packing it into 28k. Few other action-arcade games of the time matched the complexity and dynamism of the action, and the physics modeling implemented in <em>Gauntletak!</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>REGISTERED VERSION RELEASE</strong></p>\n<p>The developer released an expanded registered version of the game, mailed to players who paid for for registration. The registered version had a number of improvements over the shareware version, including more levels, new missile types, and a larger variety of enemies. Some of the new enemies had new AI behaviors, including behaviors like coordinating attacks. The registered version could accommodate twice as many objects on the screen at once, increasing the difficulty ceiling of the game. It also came with a printed manual.</p>",

The two cowboys can shoot each other, the victim going to one of two hospitals in the upper corners of the screen. Following the two cowboys are snakes and tumbleweeds; the snakes follow one cowboy, the tumbleweeds the other. If caught, a cowboy will be paralyzed for a few seconds.

You have five ships, but there are many ways to lose one. Lazer beams and triangular rays toggle on and off, so require timing and planning to avoid. Argoniks patrol the area, and are fatal to the touch - however, they can work in your favour, as they activate some types of indestructible blocks on contact, changing the blocks' frames from white to red as a signal to you. </p>\n<p>Most doors are closed by default, and are activated by firing into their brown covers. They can be closed in the same way - this is a defensive tactic to block Argoniks, but make sure you are not in the way of the door as it closes. You can collect and activate shields to deflect and block various hazards - although the ultimate challenge is to complete the game without them.</p>",

Depending on this, you can use either your tail, stinger or wings to make contact with them. Every time you boot the game, the behaviour of the crystals changes, emphasising the need for experimentation.</p>",

You must bomb the ground to dig a hole to reach the dollar signs but beware of the plane as it is dropping giant clods of dirt to fill in the hole, and maybe bury you. Even if you avoid the dirt clod, you will need to bomb to uncover the treasure again. When you gather a treasure, you must land on your base to claim it. If you are destroyed before you return to base, you drop the treasure. You can only carry one treasure at a time. After you collect all the buried dollar signs, you move on to the next level.</p>",

You must fight your way through, gathering food and treasure while destroying monsters. Each time a monster touches you, you lose energy. You can gather food, which can be eaten to restore energy. Once you reach the end of the dungeon level, you descend to the next level down. If you are playing mutiplayer and one of you dies, the other player(s) can revive their fallen comrade by shooting a heart found in the level.

Your aim is to take over several hostile planets, such as the verdant Xavier and militaristic Cytron.</p>\n<p>Gameplay takes a wider range too, eschewing the side-view blasting of its predecessor. There are two distinct gameplay styles. First you must fly up the screen <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/11460/xevious/\">Xevious</a>-style, destroying the force field towards the end of the level (fail to do this and you must replay the whole level). You must face waves of enemies as well as ground installations. There are many hidden targets to shoot; these release white flags which when collected award extra lives, a short-term shield, or a points bonus.</p>\n<p>Once you reach an accessible base, you must enter it on foot, in a section with similar gameplay to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=5013442533543\">Gauntlet</a>. Keys, weapons and bonus items are hidden in hatches on the wall, which are activated by touching them (most are empty, however). Blasting through walls (using a different weapon to your main one) is a large part of progression on these.</p>",

Aboard the Thunderfox space fighter, you are on a mission above a transporter, which contains Disilicate energy crystals intended to power the Phalon War Machine. If you do not infiltrate the transporters and their heavily-guarded Energy Rooms, and destroy the crystals, your society is doomed. It's a race against time - a death missile is being prepared, and will launch to destroy Thunderfox when time runs out. As you fly over the transport, you will encounter enemy ships and defence lasers. Once you reach the end of the ship without destroying all encroaching enemies and bases, you are automatically reversed.</p>",

It also moves past the heart which starts next to you, and even across the screen's borders. </p>\n<p>This is correct; the idea of the game is to use your gas cannon to guide the heart (which represents a clearance pod) from one end of the screen to the other, within a time limit. If this runs out, or the heart hits a wall or any of the marauding enemies or hazards, a life is lost. Controls are rotational - moving the joystick left or right changes the character's angle, while pushing forward causes him to move in that direction, with fire activating the blow-gun.</p>",

The player controls a car which moves constantly in the direction it faces, unless you hit fire button for the brake. </p>\n<p>Drive over the $ signs, special items (depending on the level they may be hearts, rings or chalices) and white vans to collect money, \nand return it to your hideout (in the south-east, represented by an H). You have limited gas, but can top this up by stopping at one of the gas stations. As time goes on, you will encounter roadblocks (which cause you to lose fuel more quickly) and stop signs (which take all your cash when you try to pass them).</p>\n<p>The police don't take this lying down - their cars (red, blue and yellow) chase you, especially when you are carrying lots of money or have hit a white van. Making contact with a cop car costs one of your three vehicles and takes any money you are carrying - money you have stashed at the hideout is safe. The ultimate goal is to find the three of the special items and then the white van, which leads to an increased difficulty level - with higher police interest no matter how much money you are carrying.</p>",

You'll control him as he kicks his way through the games puzzles.</p>\n<p>You'll be able to make your springman wander up and down the left side of the screen pushing a tile with a symbol on it before him. This tile can be kicked to the left where a stack of tiles await. If you've lined up your tile with a matching one on the other side they all shall vanish, if any tiles are above they'll fall into the newly vacant spaces. You'll also have a limited number of lightning tiles which will act like the sort of tile that it comes in contact with after you kick it. After you clear all the blocks you will be moved to a new level with, hopefully, a new background.</p>\n<p>Each level has a number of neutral tiles that you can bounce your tiles off to have them hit another area of the tile mass that you're trying to clear.</p>\n<p>A two player mode is also available where you can play against someone else on the same computer. Instead of clearing levels you'll play to see who can get a certain score. After that is reached a new area will begin.</p>",

Your red head will move vertically on the right side of the cell while holding a tile to you left. This tile will show a symbol on it. The symbol will match with tiles on the other side of the cell. Your goal is to shove the tile across the room and match it with tiles that share its symbol. Once you destroy a tile you'll receive a new tile, more specifically, a tile that matches one near or behind the one(s) you destroyed</p>\n<p>You can attack the tiles directly from the right or ricochet them off an angle in the ceiling. Another devious trick up your sleeve is the lightning tile. This tile with its lightning design can mimic any other. If it touches another tile it will act as if the correct image has touched it and booth shall explode.</p>",

It's time to grab a gun and shoot at those little pests.</p>\n<p><em>Bug Hunt</em> is a game designed for the Atari XG-1 light gun, and came bundled with the Atari XEGS and the stand-alone XG-1.</p>\n<p>The game consists of seven waves. Each wave features more of the little critters (flies, spiders, butterflies, ticks, frogs, etc.) on the sections of the PCB, waiting to be shot. Some are large and stationary and easy to hit, others are small and move rapidly and net more points. To progress into the next wave, a certain accuracy percentage must be met (from 25% to reach wave 2 to 80% to reach the final wave). The final score is converted into a performance rating - CEOs, directors and managers at the lower end, programmers, hackers and engineers at the higher end.</p>",

These can be interacted with by pointing to them with the cursor and pressing \"Fire\"; this will cause a menu with various commands to appear. Usually chests, windows or shields have items hidden within that can be picked up, while people can be given items. Note that up to four items can be carried in the player's inventory. Sometimes \"spells\" can be found; using these will show a map of the game. </p>\n<p>To enter another chamber, one points to a doorway, presses \"Fire\" and chooses the \"go\" option.</p>",

Bricks fall from the top of the screen; they have varying speeds - some fall slowly, some fall very fast. By pressing the Fire button, you can shoot a fireball which will destroy any bricks that get in its way. As time passes, more and more bricks begin to fall. </p>\n<p>If a brick falls beyond the blue line, then the line will rise a little along with your ship. If you miss a lot of bricks, you'll soon find yourself close to the top of the screen, making it harder to hit bricks in time. The bricks harm you and decrease your energy when they touch you. </p>\n<p>Shooting bricks makes the blue line descend back. If the blue line is all the way down, then shooting bricks will give you some energy.</p>",

You may turn it left/right, move it up/down, shoot the missile, and drop the bomb. Mobile patrol drone defenders and fixed missile launchers are shooting at you, so avoid them and their bullets. People are standing in certain places and crying for help, so you should pick them up positioning the chopper over them. The chopper will crash if it will run out of fuel, or collide with the wall. There are ten captives in each labyrinth. Points are accumulated for captives rescued, enemy installations destroyed, and speed.</p>\n<p>Three difficulty levels differ by points awarded. The game may be played by 1-4 persons in turns in Solo and Team mode. While in Solo mode each player controls all functions of his helicopter, in Team mode two persons are involved - while one person is controlling the chopper, another is shooting and throwing the bombs.</p>",

The design to be created is displayed on the left of the screen, and the current arrangement of gems is on the right. By clicking on a gem here, the player turns it into another type of gem - clicked multiple times, it cycles between various types of gems (the sequence is displayed at the top of the screen) and finally disappears, with all the gems above it falling down. Clicking on a gem also changes the four gems around it - but these neighboring gems cycle forward by two types of gems instead of one. </p>\n<p>There are 50 levels. If stuck, the player can press Space to restart the level, but this makes him lose a life. There is a time limit, and running out of time causes the player to lose a life and the level to restart.</p>",

Something is keeping him up.</p>\n<p>It's those damn cats again.</p>\n<p>In ZiMAG's <em>Cat Nap</em>, the player controls a person bent on revenge against three noisy alley cats\u2014Puff, Pearl, and Brutus. The cats walk back and forth across the top of a picket fence, meowing constantly and loudly. The player starts with an inventory of six objects which he must hurl out the windows in hopes of knocking one of the felines off the fence, effectively silencing them for a brief period. The protagonist is never actually shown, but is represented by a hand that can be moved left and right between three windows. After selecting an object, the player then positions his hand in front of one of the windows and uses the fire button to chuck the object at one of the unsuspecting kittycats. If the player is able to continuously strike each of the cats within the 5 minute time limit, he wins the game and is finally able to catch some Z's.</p>\n<p>But watch out for Scruffy! This lazy dog, who normally sleeps peacefully in the grass in front of the fence, will awaken in a fury of barks if one of the cats happen to fall on him, adding even more noise to the cacophony of meows.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The player controls a crewman on the USS Sea Moss, a nuclear submarine patrolling the icy waters of the North Atlantic. While conducting routine maintenance, the player finds themselves alive, alone, in a sealed hatchway, following an underwater gas attack by a treasonous saboteur. The player's Pyrrhic goal is to find and neutralize the saboteur and scuttle the vessel to prevent its military and technological secrets from being recovered by an enemy power. But the first problem is surviving escaping from the hatchway into the gas-filled interior...</p>\n<p>The game's interface is via an appropriately claustrophobic windowed text system not dissimilar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/1405/adventure-international/\">Adventure International</a>'s, with certain screen areas indicating location, exits, inventory, and player input. The player communicates with the computer by using two-word VERB NOUN phrases. Though the interface is primitive, the game is still more sophisticated than <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/202/brian-moriarty/\">Moriarty</a>'s earlier Adventure in the Fifth Dimension, which was written in BASIC -- this game employs machine language.  Soon after, Moriarty would be working at <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Infocom\">Infocom</a>.</p>\n<p>This game was published in issue #5 of A.N.A.L.O.G. Computing as type-in code, and was inspired by cover artwork for a long-dormant submarine arcade game hanging in the magazine's offices.  \"Feelies\" appearing photographed in the magazine helped in the solution of some of its puzzles.</p>",

        "description": "<p>For decades the star system Chi Draconis has been held in slavery by the Vorrakian fortress built into an orbiting asteroid. Capable of destroying entire planets, the fortress has all but wiped out the Draconian Star Force and extorts a vast wealth of transuranic ore from the enslaved system. Recently, though, a ray of hope has been glimpsed: a fissure in the asteroid was detected by long-range neutrino scans. It could lead to the core of the fortress, to the emerald power crystal, to freedom for Chi Draconis!</p>\n<p>Five brave pilots in tiny fighters are lined up to attempt navigation of the fissure and destruction of the power emerald. First they must face the patrolling Vorrakian squadron, then the mine field, and on through unknown dangers and defenses. One at a time you will guide them; if the first fails, then the second will start the approach. The one who succeeds, in the fine Sisyphean tradition of 1980's video games, gets to start all over again.</p>\n<p>The game screen offers a cross-sectional view through the asteroid. If your fighter impacts the cavern wall, a mine, or any of the myriad hazards populating the fissure, the end is instantaneous; there is no flash of light, no debris, just oblivion. Suddenly you are back on approach toward the asteroid, guiding the next brave pilot, or on the score screen looking at your rating, which begins with \"Ground Gripper.\" Forward movement is relentless. Thrusters will speed up the ship temporarily, but there is no stopping and surveying for the best route. Though the ships are each equipped with a laser, its range is hardly greater than the length of the ship. All your offense is point-blank, all your defense lies in dodging.</p>\n<p>Two caves of increasing difficulty await those who conquer the first level, and the adept who surpasses all three meets the first cave again, but with sluggish controls. That's if you have the easy data access of the game's disk version. The cassette version can only work with what is loaded in memory, so defeating level one takes you back to level one.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Plattermania</em> is set in a circus and can accommodate one to four players. The player controls a clown up on stage who has 12 poles. As the clown, each player starts the game with 10 platters. Before the start of each player's turn, the number of platters which must be spun simultaneously is displayed. To reach the goal, the player must have the correct number of plates spinning at once for at least 8 seconds. Platters will fall if they start to wobble and the player does not move the clown to it and spin it up soon enough. They will also fall if they are spun too hard. If the player breaks three platters without achieving the 8-second goal, the turn ends. Otherwise, the turn lasts until a platter falls and breaks after the 8-second goal has been achieved. Bonus multipliers for score can be earned by keeping platters spinning beyond the 8-second goal. Once all players have had a turn, the scores of all players will be shown on screen. Each time a player meets the goal, the player is moved up one level. If a player fails two turns in a row, they will be dropped down a level. When a player runs out of platters, the game is over.</p>",

The protagonist is a man cryogenically frozen in modern times and thawed years later, in a world populated only by women. The goal of the game is to escape your imprisonment, and perhaps somehow restore your gender to existence. </p>\n<p>The screen shows the room that the player is in, as well as the inventory on the left and a map on the right. The game uses a \"point-and-click\" interface: the player moves the cursor around using the joystick, and presses FIRE to bring up a menu with interaction options for the selected object. Frequently, the game shows closeups of objects such as drawers and lockers in a separate, small window. A button below the first-person view allows to walk in any direction where there's an exit. Up to four items can be carried at a time, and items can only be dropped in specific spots. The protagonist must regularly eat food, otherwise he will starve into a game over.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Adax</em> is an arcade adventure game where the player becomes a special agent, dispatched by the Earth military to the planet Adax in order to blow up a secret alien base and recover several disks with secret info. </p>\n<p>The agent must travel around the six sectors of the planet, dodging or killing dangers and finding crates with objects inside--such as keys, ammo, \"spheres\" or disks. The enemies can be dispatched by kicking or punching them, by shooting them with a pistol (though ammo is limited), or by tossing \"spheres\" that roll along the ground and explode on impact. The \"spheres\" can also destroy the ever-present landmines which otherwise have to be jumped over. The keys can open locked doors, but are one-use. In an adventure game fashion, there are also special items with specific uses. </p>\n<p>Each sector contains a vehicle that can take the agent to any other sector. </p>\n<p>Contact with an enemy or falling from a height drains the agent's health, but killing enemies restores health.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Syn Boga Wiatru</em> (Son of the Wind God) is a platform game, set in Inca cities and temples. The player is a professor who, on each of the game's four levels, is trying to find a priceless amphora. Jumping around and climbing ladders and ropes feature heavily. The main threats, apart from steep drops, are various enemies that walk around; falling a long distance or contact with an enemy drains the professor's health. Running out of health ends the game immediately. </p>\n<p>The professor has two thrown weapons: rocks and knives, both of which kill enemies instantly. There is limited ammunition, and rocks have the additional demerit of being affected by gravity over long distances. Ammo can be replenished by collecting diamond-like pickups. There are also keys, used to open locked doors (each key is one-use, so it's necessary to decide which doors to open and which to leave alone). Finally, the player can find cups that replenish health.</p>",

Customers and bandits come through the doors; bandits must be quickly shot before they do the same to you, but shooting an innocent person by accident results in losing a life. If a customer is able to enter the bank unmolested, they will deposit money; once all 12 doors have had customers deposit money through them, the next level begins. </p>\n<p>Sometimes, messengers will come in with numerous hats on their heads; these can be shot down, eventually revealing a moneybag to be shot for points, or a bomb that makes you lose a life if you shoot it. </p>\n<p>Certain levels are set during night-time, which makes it harder to discern the good guys from the bad guys.</p>",

Like the original, it is a computer version of the pen-and-paper Battleship game. There are five ships for each player; they can be rotated between eight angles (horizontal, vertical and 45-degree diagonal), and some of the ships have a slightly more complex shape than just a line. </p>\n<p>Also like in the original, in each turn the player, instead of firing at one square, gets to choose a number of squares to fire at (the more ships the player has left, the more squares they can attack each turn). An animated sequence at the end of the turn shows the shots being fired. </p>\n<p>A two-player competitive mode is also available.</p>",

As a caveman, on each level the player has to find food for his family. The main protagonist wanders around the wilderness and explores caves in his search. Hostile animals and plants have to be avoided - contact with them drains health. There are also dangerous environment elements such as bonfires or deep water. There is a time limit on each level, and a specific amount of food to be collected before the level can be completed.</p>",

To complicate matters, he is allergic to the plants grown on his plantation and can only walk upon designated paths. </p>\n<p>Each level is a mazelike path around which our hero can move, with the occasional crossroads.

The hero can walk through thin walls to accomplish his goal. </p>\n<p>A deadly, roving sphere on each level must be avoided; colliding with it kills instantly. Every level also has a time limit.

The way to the exit is usually blocked with various obstacles: rocks, boxes, pits. </p>\n<p>Rocks can be pushed around, but only one at a time, and they cannot be pulled. Boxes are similar to rocks, but a row of them can be pushed around as one. Pits need to be filled with a rock or a box, depending on their shape. Teleporters transport the hero to another teleporter. Bombs can be pushed around, and explode when a trigger is pushed, destroying everything (and detonating other bombs) near them. </p>\n<p>Every level has a time limit. Passwords can be used to skip to later levels.</p>",

The player takes control of the world's armed forces, opposing an army led by a rogue general. </p>\n<p>The game takes place on the world map, covered with cities; depending on the difficulty level, the number of cities that belong to the player and to the computer opponent are different. Some of the cities already have military units stationed in them. Playing in turns, the players each move their units around and give building orders to the cities. The goal of each player is to take over all the cities and destroy all of the enemy military. </p>\n<p>Each of a player's units can move during his turn, as long as it still has movement points left for that turn; units also use up fuel and regularly have to refill it by entering a city--an unit that runs out of fuel is immobile. Upon contact with an enemy unit, combat breaks out, ending with the opposing units losing some of its manpower. An unit is destroyed once its manpower reaches 0. </p>\n<p>Cities can be ordered to construct units--ground vehicles, planes, and ships; the more population there is in a city, the faster it builds units, and the more room it has for stationing units. Stronger units take more time to produce.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Fred</em> is a platform game, where the player controls a caveman, walking horizontally through the levels. Like in nearly every platform game, there are hanging platforms for the caveman to jump on, though sometimes parts of the platforms give way. Climbable ropes also appear. </p>\n<p>There are enemies on the way, such as birds and frogs; Fred can defend himself by tossing rocks that travel in an arc, though ammunition is limited, but Fred can pick up new rocks along the way. Another weapon is the spray can; when found, Fred can spray in front of himself, killing enemies this way. Contact with an enemy or a hazard (such as a cactus) costs a life and sends the player back to the last checkpoint. </p>\n<p>Weapons can also be used to crack open jugs found along the way. There are pick-ups to find inside, such as rocks, ammunition for the spray can, a cap that protects from a single loss of life, or shields that make Fred immune to all dangers. </p>\n<p>The game was originally released in 1990 as part of a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/52769/misjafred/\">compilation</a>.</p>",

The goal of the game is to find Syrylak and defeat him. </p>\n<p>The player controls Tannatos as he travels around the game world; similarly to a classic platform game, dexterity in jumping from platform to platform and in avoiding dangers is necessary. Touching an enemy or their projectile kills Tannatos instantly, and there are limited lives. </p>\n<p>There are numerous items strewn around; Tannatos can carry up to three at once and use them wherever necessary to solve puzzles. Unnecessary items can be dropped in specific spots. </p>\n<p>An indicator in the corner of the screen shows the progress made in the game so far.</p>",

In the field, this can be used to pass to another player. When not in ball possession, pressing the fire button changes the controlled athlete to the one who is nearest to the ball (unless he is already controlled by a human player on the same team; then the second-nearest is used). </p>\n<p>Available options are number of human players, three match times (10, 45 or 90 minutes) and four difficulty levels.</p>",

The game takes place in 3216 AD and Earth is about to be destroyed by aliens from the planet Tritan. They have established their base on Mars and the pilot needs to travel there to take out the Time Scalers, devices that allow the aliens to travel to Earth. There are seven scalers to take out and there only two possible landing paths per scaler.</p>\n<p>The game is a side-scrolling shooter over the surface of the planet Mars. After take-off, the ship needs to bomb radar dishes, time scaler tripods and fuel dumps, while taking out missile space cruisers and auto droids with a regular laser. The ship only has a limited amount of fuel and shields. Fuel is replenished by bombing fuel dumps. The goal is to survive until the time scaler devices have been destroyed, and also to avoid mountains while flying. When fuel is about to run out, it is possible to eject the pilot.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The empire of Xandor has been under siege by dark forces. Desperate, the King Gaelyn sent a request for help to the lords of the castles in his land. From each castle, three subjects - a prince, a knight and a page were selected to face riddles and dragons.</p>\n<p>This is the background of the board game <em>Trivia Quest</em>. After selecting the difficulty and their castle, each of the participating players (one to four, there are no computer players) needs to choose the correct answer out of four options in the first so-called \"wisdom round\". This is necessary to accumulate enough gold and food to enter the game map with a character and be able to progress there. An incorrect answer starts the next player's turn. </p>\n<p>On the board itself, movement is also dependent on answering the questions which are prompted by landing on one of the trivia question squares. These are divided into four categories (for example,a TV square means a question out of television, literature or movies), and the faster a question has been answered correctly, the more squares a player's character can move. It's possible to switch between the three different characters provided enough gold has been accumulated. There are also special squares denoting dragon lairs. These trigger an arcade sequence where additional gold can be gained if the dragon is defeated, but in case of a loss the dragon also takes gold from the player. The fighting ability is influenced by the character type, with the page being the weakest. Finally, there are squares and situations which can lead to a \"wisdom duel\", meaning a player vs. player question battle.The quest ends when all three characters have reached a home castle, the winner being the player with the most gold.</p>",

These two characters try to murder the happy carnival crowds by dropping missiles on the ferris wheels and planting bombs on the roller coaster. The only one to stop them is Super Sam who has to save the rides' passengers from a gruesome death and then shoot the perpetrators. </p>\n<p><em>Carnival Massacre</em> is split into two parts. First Butcher Bill has to be stopped at the ferris wheels. The player stands at the ground below the ferris wheels and above them Butcher Bill will move in a sky lift. He will throw rocks at the passengers and as they fall out from the wheels the player has to try and catch them. At the same time the player has to avoid being hit by rocks since that will kill them. If you miss too many passengers a giant coil spring will appear and bounce around the screen. The player has to jump over it to avoid dying. When the ferris wheels are empty and the player has managed to save at least six passengers, they get the chance to take down the villain with a gun. After that the player moves on to the roller coaster where Ruthless Rick has planted some mines. When the cars hit the mines the passengers will be thrown out and the player has to catch them just like at the ferris wheels. Once again Butcher Bill appears and start throwing stones at the player. The rules are the same as for the ferris wheels.</p>",

The game is played from a top down perspective and the player races against three AI drivers on five different race courses. Four of these are based on real race tracks from around the world; Indy, Monza, Watkins Glen and Monaco. The difficulty level can be set before the race and ranges from amateur to championship. The higher the level the harsher the competition from the AI drivers will get. The player also has to watch out for oil slicks and trees by the tracks. The racing can take place both day and night. The game is played with joystick and the player gets to steer, accelerate, shift gears and brake.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Stellar Shuttle</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/66710/lunar-rescue/\">Lunar Rescue</a> variant. \nThe planet Ttam has drifted into a dangerous asteroid belt, requiring that all inhabitants be evacuated to a mother ship orbiting outside the belt. The player has the shuttle ships to work with, to fly through the asteroids and pluck the refugees one at a time from the surface. To help avoid the asteroids, the speed of the shuttle can be slowed down by using the shuttle's retro rockets. The retro rockets can also be used against dragons that start appearing at level two.</p>\n<p>Once the player has picked up a refugee, he or she has to return up to the mother ship. Here players will get access to a blaster that can be used to clear the way through the asteroids, however there are also falling comets that require maneuvering and speed to avoid and drifting derelict spaceships that need to be shot.</p>\n<p>For each level there are six refugees that have to be rescued one at a time. Once that has been done, the player moves on to the next level. </p>\n<p>Scoring is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each Landing: 200 points</li>\n<li>Return of each refugee safely to the mother ship: 300 points</li>\n<li>Large asteroids: 20 points</li>\n<li>Small asteroids: 50 points</li>\n<li>Derelict Spaceships: 300 points</li>\n<li>Dragons: 200 points</li>\n<li>Every six rescued refugees: 1,000 points</li>\n</ul>",

The player has to clear a level within a time limit by moving symbols of the same design left or right, taking into account possible ways in which they may fall if there is no space beneath them. When symbols of the same design come in contact with each other, they disappear. An editor for constructing levels is included.</p>\n<p><em>Chromatics</em> is a standard falling blocks game based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Columns\">Columns</a> concept. Different colored blocks need to be arranged into sequences (horizontally or vertically) of at least three to make them disappear. If the player isn't successful, the number of blocks stack until the top, at which point the game is over. The number of colors in play can be adjusted from three to five.</p>",

The player either takes the role of one war party or battles against another fellow wargamer.</p>\n<p>During each turn, both sides give detailed orders to their units which are then performed simultaneously. Order are assigned on the tactical map, but for planning there are also four strategic maps available which either show the terrain, Allied units, Axis units or all units. Additionally there are tables about corps (a list of all units), supply and airplanes. The simulation of the two latter are a focus of the game model. Of course there are also a number of other factors, including morale, unit capabilities, or, fatigue. A variety of options can be used to change the complexity of the game, including the AI level or if enemy units are visible. Supply and airplane effects can also be deactivated.</p>",

The player manages the production in the eight provinces; the goal being to industrialize them in order to make the country a big player and increase the population. If a province is advanced enough, it will merge with Great Britain which simplifies the administration. The game is almost completely text based and all time is spent in menus in which the player makes production and resource distribution choices.</p>",

It is set during the American Civil War and covers, not entirely surprising, the battle of Chickamauga from 1863. The player either takes the role of the Confederates or the Union troops and tries to defeat the enemy. During each turn, both players (or one player and the AI) give orders to their units and then they get performed simultaneously. The simulated aspects of war include morale, unit abilities, war tactics, morale or fatigue. Various options can be set before and during a match, e.g. switching certain game mechanics off like the invisibility of enemy units outside sight.</p>",

Britain is divided between 16 kingdoms, but because everyone wants to reign the whole country, a violent dispute is inevitable. So King Arthur manages his kingdom, builds up an army and prepares for the things to come.</p>\n<p>The majority of the game is spent in the menus of Camelot: Merlin's room (magic is used to put negative effects on other kingdoms, but usage is restricted), the treasury (all financial aspects including taxes and army management), the throne room (official communication with other kingdoms like paying tributes or declaring war), the round table (monitoring and managing the contentment of the knights; a revolution would be unhealthy) and the trap room (only used when the kingdom is under attack). Arthur can also move outside the city and visit his vassals or other kingdoms (the latter with non-friendly intentions). The last component is the battle system which, just like the rest of the game, is in real-time. Similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Legionnaire\">Legionnaire</a>; the player commands the army on a overhead map.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Armor Assault</em> is a turn-based strategy game which is about tactical tank battles between NATO and Soviets. However, this is not a wargame as each side has only six tanks to manage. The rules are relatively simple: in each round, orders are issued to the tanks and then the orders of both sides are performed simultaneously. Options include movement, setting mines or fire. The latter comes in two variants, either direct fire or opportunity fire which gets triggered when an enemy tank moves by during the movement phase - each tank is restricted to one type per round. The terrain plays a role because it changes the movement costs and can provide cover.</p>\n<p>The game comes with six tank types (can be chosen before a match) with certain advantages and disadvantages and twelve scenarios with different victory conditions (mostly to conquer or destroy a certain target). The editor can be used to create more maps and tanks.</p>",

The sun in the center of the game can be set to exert positive, negative or no gravity on the players' ships, and the gravitational force can be set in five levels from very weak to very strong. The playfield can be set to either wrap around or to have the ships bouncing off its boundaries, and the maximum speed of the ships can be set in four different levels.</p>",

However, in an instance you are completely taken aback as you look behind and see a blazing fireball speeding in your direction. In a splash second, you perform a huge leap towards an opening in the wall. \u201ePhew\u201c, you think to yourself, \u201ethat was close!\u201c.</p>\n<p>Alien Hell is a top-down survival adventure game which stars a desperate human trapped on the planet Sol III. Inhabited originally by humans, this planet has been gradually taken over by an alien race to exploit the resources of the planet. Because of the harmful effect of the raw materials on aliens, the strange race has decided to use human labour for extraction instead. One day the force field that protects our hero\u2019s jailcell begins to malfunction, and the man dashes toward the exit. That is only the beginning of the nightmare that awaits him.</p>\n<p>The protagonist of Alien Hell has no weapons and the only way to survive is to run. Alien guards, fireballs and toxic gas are some of the many things that the player has to avoid. Crystals can be found in certain places, however their utility is up for the player to figure out. There is a choice of difficulty level in the beginning of the game. Harder difficulty levels increase the agility of the enemy aliens and the velocity of many natural hazards. To finish the game, the player has to work out how to escape the labyrinth.</p>",

The player starts at the bottom part of the screen and has to traverse first a road full of golf carts, bulldozers and lawn mowers and then a river full of logs and alligators. Each level has one or more golf balls that the player has to pick up and carry back to the starting position. He can only carry one ball at a time so he has to move past the dangers multiple times before a level is completed. Points are earned for each golf ball recovered. As the player progresses through the levels more and more threats are introduced, such as monster frogs and new types of vehicles. There are ten levels in total.</p>",

The player races his or her car around a circuit consisting of six lanes and has to avoid crashing into another car that races in the opposite direction. To avoid the opposite car, the player has to switch lanes, something that can only be done in the middle of each straight. The player doubles the speed by pressing a button. When at normal speed, the player can only move one lane at a time, while at double speed he or she can move two. On all lanes, there are dots that have to be collected to be able to move on to the next level. The game ends after five crashes. </p>\n<p>There are a number of variants of the game, with different options turned on or off. This includes choosing if dots should be restored after a crash, whether there should be one or two computer controlled cars and whether the crash cars can accelerate or not. The game can be played by up to four players who take turns playing. There is also a competitive mode where one player takes control of the crash car and has to hit the other player.</p>",

If the worm manages to eat all the fireflies, he will be transferred to the next level.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Duch</em> is a side-scrolling arcade game. The player's task is to find all magical items scattered around the maze. Only one item is visible at a time, after collecting it another object appears.

The element moves in the indicated direction until it is stopped by another element or the edge of the board. The player may use many useful elements, such as mirrors (reflecting laser beam), bombs or detonators (destroying various barriers). However certain elements should not be brought into contact, for example the ball smashes the mirror and the bomb blows up if collides with the board edge.</p>",

You can play against the computer with a choice of four skill levels or against a human player. The computer player is represented by four women. For every winning round the player uncovers one puzzle of a picture with naked opponent. To uncover the whole picture it is necessary to win sixteen rounds. The aim is to fill the board with as many bricks of your own color as possible. On each turn the player places a disc on the 8x8 grid by selecting a location where the opponents discs will become trapped between two of his discs. The enclosed discs are flipped over to the players color. The game ends when there are no empty tiles left. The player with the most discs on board wins the game.</p>",

The game features a few power-ups in the form of hexagons with a specific letter in (f.e. E - an extra life, P turns the enemies into tokens, B - doubles the gained points for collecting bombs).

The game takes place in the year 2122 on the international research station on the planet Saturn, took over by the alien forces. The only hope for rescue is getting through the ranks of the enemy to broadcast the help signal from the main computer transmitter. The aim is to find appropriate objects scattered in the underground of the planet and use them in the appropriate places, necessary to accomplish the mission. The player has an unlimited ammo. The contact with the enemies or spikes means an instant death. The player can carry a total of five items. The biggest problem is the numerous unnecessary items that can't be put down.</p>",

Your plane will also crash if it flies into a raincloud, which will appear from level 3 onwards.\nIf you run out of fuel your plane will also crash. There is no way to refill your fuel, so you better hurry.</p>\n<p>The game has 8 levels and you can choose whether you want to start from level 1 or level 3 in the options menu.\nWhen you complete a level, you score 10 the number of the level you're at, multiplied by the number of fuel units you have left.\nShould you make it all the way through level 8, you score an additional 5 percent of your total score for each unused plane and you'll also receive a bonus message.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Inside</em> is a side-scrolling action game for up to two players, based on the C64 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Chip-War\">Chip-War</a>. The player controls a ship placed inside the computer (on the main board) who has to repair all eight chips needed to supply the power to the computer. After finding the broken chip the player is transferred to the diagram board. The player must replace the damaged parts before time runs out. At any time the player can check the amount of remaining errors (T letter) or view the correct schema (S letter, costs 100 time units). Not repaired components results in loss of computer power. All damages affect the game itself, for example, damaged sound card distorts the music, damaged graphics card blurs the screen view, damaged joystick port interacts with steering the ship. Reaching the zero power level turns off the computer and ends the game.</p>",

The player chooses the image from pictures that keep rapidly changing. Each puzzle consists of a set of twenty parts. The bottom of the screen consists of time indicator and a belt with constantly moving puzzles. After selecting one piece the player must place it in the appropriate place on the board. For the remaining time the player receives bonus points. The game ends when the time runs out. The game saves the progress every five levels and thus the player does not have to start from scratch.</p>",

To do so, the player must touch a blot of paint, changing the color of the device, which allows him to remove squares of the same color. In addition to the time limit, the player has to watch out for moving enemies and crosses which change between red (harmless) and white (deadly). Once in a while the player may acquire bonuses appearing on the level, such as extra time, temporary ability to control the device (moves into one indicated field), temporary immortality shield. Further levels introduce a lot of board modifications, such as teleports moving the device to a different location.</p>",

The entire code, written in the Turbo Basic XL language, is 10 lines long. </p>\n<p>There are two planets on the screen, with a random size and position. Each player uses a joystick to control a cannon on the surface of his planet. The cannon can be moved along the surface of the planet, and a missile can be launched with the \"fire\" key. Missiles are affected by gravitational pull as they fly. A missile digs a hole in the planet when it strikes. The cannons cannot be moved over a hole in the planet's surface. A player wins if he destroys his opponent's planet by managing to fire a missile into its center.</p>",

        "description": "<p>\"A bug has to eat.\" These words of wisdom set the premise for the unlikely elevation of the gypsy moth to video game protagonist. Indeed, Avalon Hill's <em>Gypsy</em> puts you in the bare feet of a smiling, happy-go-lucky gypsy moth caterpillar who has come upon a backyard with the rare and lucious Qok tree. Our hero could feast all day in idyllic bliss, munching on leaves and sipping nectar from blossoms. Alas, such a delicious tree is a resource contested. There are Flying Ants of Tasmania crawling over the bark, the Locknest Spider, and worst of all, the truly painful-in-the-posterior, Fandango Bee.</p>\n<p>The Qok tree, your playing field, is spread abundantly in elevation across eight screens, and you steer the smiling, fat caterpillar around it via the branches and trunk. Leaves are everywhere, continuously regrowing, and easy to munch, but the real points lie in the blossoms, which come and go in mere seconds, making it a race to get the ravenous little mouth chomping in the right spot. The tiny ants will throw you from the branch, so they must be avoided. The Fandango Bee at first just randomly flits by, but after enough time watching the caterpillar munch on her beloved tree, this fury from lower Sumatra will pursue and sting. Each sting -- and ant and spider bite -- subtracts points, but by the third one, the little caterpillar turns a sickly shade of blue and moves slowly. The fourth sting leaves it a crumpled heap on the grass below, just another lesson of nature.</p>",

The player's task is to guess the password in a certain number of attempts. Each correct answer gives a point, each wrong answer draws a part of a hanged man. After reaching a certain amount of mistakes the player becomes a hangman and the game ends. In two player mode contestants alternately guess the same password, knowing the letters given by the opponent. Each of them has its own gallows.</p>",

The pilot maneuvers desperately over jagged terrain between blasts from alien ships, trying to stop as many as possible from landing. How will it end? The same way most computer simulations of lone heroism against countless invaders: not well for the pilot, but perhaps a high score for the player.</p>\n<p><em>Moon Patrol</em> joined the countless clones of the coin-operated arcade games invading home computers in the 1980's. There are no astronauts to protect, just invading saucers to shoot, but the aliens keep shooting back even after they land on the hardest difficulty. Consequently, the terrain becomes a real hazard as you drop low to blast saucers on the ground. Fuel is a limiting factor, even though there is always enough to get you to the next landing pad. The problem is that you only have one pass at the pad; there is no reverse, and while you can slow down, there is no stopping. Four levels of difficulty from alien ships that do not shoot back to aliens shooting at you when coming down and after landing.</p>",

Stop them by brushing them off. If you brush teeth long enough they will turn blue and blue teeth can't be invaded by plaque devils. Be careful though, because if you don't brush off a plaque invader in time the tooth will turn black and you won't get any points for that tooth.</p>\n<p>The game has 3 difficulty levels: leicht (easy), mittel (medium), and schwer (hard).</p>",

        "description": "<p>Ready to match reflexes with your Atari, mano-a-mano? Sports Illustrated lent its name to this early boxing simulation, which gives you an elevation of the ring and two boxers throwing three different punches. Matching your opponent's punch makes a block; each unblocked punch is a point. At least thirty head-shots in a round may earn you a technical knockout, but that's the only knockout available. Otherwise it's five to fifteen rounds, which at three minutes per round can give you a genuine endurance contest. Wear down a friend or just a single joystick, or allow the microprocessor to take both boxers. The footwork is simple, back-and-forth, but like in the real ring, probably the key to championship.</p>\n<p>Score, rounds, and time are displayed large enough above the play window to let a quick glance tell you where you are, but your boxer will also grunt and drop his jaw each time he gets hit. If you see a lot of that, the bell will be a welcome sound, not to mention the thirty seconds' rest between rounds.</p>",

The monsters are represented by numbers which show how many hit points they have. The strength of a monster's attacks is proportional to its health. The player character can collect healing potions to restore hit points and scrolls that increase maximum health, as well as more powerful weapons that increase the maximum damage. However, monsters can steal items from the ground. </p>\n<p>Each dungeon level has a staircase to the lower level, where more powerful monsters and weapons can be found.

The entire code, written in the Turbo Basic XL language, is 10 lines long. </p>\n<p>In the game, the player controls a car (represented by a single pixel) which must survive on a racetrack as long as possible, avoiding running into walls and into the single-pixel obstacles that keep rapidly appearing on the track. If, upon crashing, the player has scored a minimum of 800 points (10 points are gained for each obstacle that appears), he finds himself on a new, circular racetrack. The game keeps track of high score. </p>\n<p>Version 1.1 of the game adds an on-screen score display, as well as score multipliers gained for making a lap around the entire racetrack. At first, each obstacle is worth 1 point; completing each lap increases this value and gives a large score bonus. The second level now requires 1000 points to access.</p>",

Flying around space consumes fuel; being low on fuel prevents you from mining ore, and running out of fuel causes a game over. Black holes are also dangerous, as they destroy parts of the cargo hold, and escaping them consumes a lot of fuel.</p>",

The goal of the player is to make as much money as possible in twelve hours (from 7:00 till 19:00) by collecting packages from one part of the city and delivering them to the final customer. The main screen is divided into a map of the whole city with current weather, road window and indicators display panel (earned money, remaining time, remaining fuel). The rainy weather may affect the brakes' functionality, therefore speed should be adjusted to the conditions on the road. The player can refuel at one of the four gas stations in exchange for a fee. Fuel stations are shown only for two seconds each game. Crashing the bike into a kerb results in the loss of 30 minutes, crashing into a skip results in loss of carrying package. Collecting packages dropped from the window requires catching them before they fall to the ground. The package is delivered by throwing it through the open doors.</p>",

The treasure may be one of the five objects hidden in one of five different places. Alternating with the computer the player tries to guess what is the treasure and where it's hidden, by choosing a row (type of object) and a column (location) on a grid. The player has knowledge of four rows/columns where the treasure definitely can't be found, and the computer player has knowledge of four others. When choosing a spot the player chooses a grid square by pointing the intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines. </p>\n<p>If the computer knows that the chosen spot isn't the right one (because it's in one of the wrong rows/columns known to the computer), the player is told so. Otherwise the player is asked if he wants to check whether the chosen location contains treasure. The player wins if he \"checks\" the location that contains treasure. The player loses if he agrees to \"check\" a wrong location, fails to \"check\" the right location, or if the computer finds the treasure first.</p>",

The player must feed the dragon with the randomly appearing spiders to score points, however feeding the dragon makes it grow longer. The later the dragon will eat the spider, the more points he receives. The dragon loses a life when he bites its own or opponent's tail, eats an obstacle in the form of a head or a ball (choking) or hit the wall.</p>",

The cells can be moved two squares in any direction, including diagonally, or can be cloned by selecting the empty field next to our cell. By placing the cell next to opponent's cells, the player will take them over and change the genetic code to the opposite. The stage is finished when all empty spaces on the board are filled or after the destruction of all opponent's cells. The number of cells remaining on board decides who won the duel. A draw is impossible.\nThe game features 60 levels altogether, each with a different location of the stone obstacles.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Klony 2010</em> is a puzzle board game where the player competes with the computer. The aim is to fill the board with as many own cells as possible. The cells can be moved two squares in any direction, including diagonally, or can be cloned by selecting the empty field next to our cell. By placing the cell next to opponent's cells, the player will take them over and change the genetic code to the opposite. The stage is finished when all empty spaces on the board are filled or after the destruction of all opponent's cells. The number of cells remaining on board decides who won the duel. A draw is impossible.</p>\n<p>The game is an enhanced version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/67922/klony/\">Klony</a>, released in 2006.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Laser Chess</em> is an unofficial enhanced port of Compute's <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=laser+chess\">Laser Chess</a>, released back in 1987. It's a chess variant for two players. The goal is same as in traditional chess game - defeat the opponent's king. The gameplay is enhanced by a laser weaponry, although the players may choose the standard way of playing. The player may manipulate (by moving and rotating) all the pieces. There are eight types of pieces with special abilities, such as splitting or absorbing the laser beam. Basically most of the pieces are covered with mirrors reflecting the laser beam. Laser piece fires a laser beam in a straight line into a mirror piece placed opposite. The laser beam reflected by the mirror moves forward until it hits another mirror (including opponent's one), wall (beam disappears), absorbing piece (beam disappears) or destructible piece (including own one). The king and the laser have no mirror protection, some of the other pieces are protected only on the selected sides and the diagonal piece can't be destroyed by a laser beam, because all of its surfaces are reflective. The loss of the king means the end the game, the loss of the laser - the necessity of playing chess in the traditional way.  </p>\n<p>This version of the game features additional difficulty levels, enhanced sound effects and a limiting playing time clock.</p>",

And they must also obtain gems to unlock the door to the Stall.

        "description": "<p><em>Tecno Ninja</em> is a sci-fi arcade game. As a ninja the player must reach the final chamber of each level and defeat the stage boss. Apart from running and jumping, the ninja may use fists to fight encountered enemies and destroy selected objects, which can hide a variety of useful items, especially keys, extra lives or coins. Keys are required to open the doors blocking inaccessible parts of the level. The number of keys equals the number of doors, therefore it is very important to find all the keys. This means basically the necessity of breaking all the objects and overcome adversaries. Energy deducted by encountered opponents and obstacles (electric barriers, spikes and others) may be supplemented by collecting energy boosters and extra life hearts.</p>",

He puts on his diving suit and, controlled by the player, starts the search underwater.</p>\n<p>The non-scrolling screen is shown from the side and is mostly covered by water. At the bottom of the screen are platforms on which gold bars randomly appear. The player needs to navigate to the gold bar and use a rope on them (which happens automatically by touching them) so Captain Sticky can retrieve them. After every gold bar, it is necessary to reach the surface in order to get a new rope (which also refills the limited air supply). Other obstacles are enemies (the player character carries a harpoon which can be used to get rid of some), deadly force fields, bombs dropped by helicopters and an overall time limit.</p>\n<p>After collecting ten bars the player moves on to a new of the overall eight levels which loop with a higher difficulty after beating all. The first eight difficulty levels can be chosen before starting a new game and the 32K version has a highscore list.</p>",

Unlike the arcade game, the road and river sections take place on different screens but are still considered a single level. Once both have been completed, the game moves on to the next difficulty level. From the second level, the sidewalk in the middle of the screen starts rolling. The game can be played by a single player or by two players simultaneously.</p>",

The player controls an agent whose task it is to stop a cosmitron device from exploding. The device has become critical after a sinister scientist has removed it's radiation control cubes and the player has to retrieve a number of these (two to four depending on level) and put them back in the device. There is a time limit and if the cubes are not brought back in time everything will blow up. Making contact with various obstacles and enemies will also lead to failure. There are five difficulty levels which decide the time limit and which obstacles the player will come across. Enemies include roaming robots while traps include mines in dark rooms where sound is the player's only clue and lasers that randomly flash as the player passes through a room.</p>",

If you guess correctly, that letter will be revealed. If not, part of the platform or man will appear on screen. Get enough incorrect guesses and you will see the man hanged and the answer will be given out. For a two-player game, one player looks away while the other enters their own word (done by pressing the [Esc] key at any time during the game) and whoever looked away has to guess it.</p>",

The snakes grow in size as the game goes on and if the player attacks one in the middle it will split and the two halves go in different directions. Like in Pac-Man there are guards, the Serpent Security Force, that are out to get the player. There are three of them roaming the maze and if they make contact with the player a life is lost. There is one way to take out the guards though. If the player eats a snake that a guard is touching, the guard too will get eaten. The game ends when all of the player's three lives are lost.</p>",

For each pill that Herbie eats his body grows longer. In addition to the pills there are obstacles that the player has to avoid colliding with since that will cost a life. The same will happen if Herbie collides with his own long tail. After each level there is a bonus level where Herbie is joined by a second worm which is called Hank. Hank is out to catch Herbie and if he manages to do so the player will not get any bonus points.

When the evil baron Herburt found about Janosik's love - Maryna, he captured her and imprisoned her in his castle, hoping to lure Janosik to certain doom. It's up to player if Janosik will succeed in freeing Maryna and repaying the baron for this deed, or fail miserably - hanging on a hook.</p>\n<p>The game world is divided into forest, village and castle areas. Our hero is armed with shepherd's axe, but he will find other items as well.</p>\n<p>This platform game is loosely based on the story around Juraj J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk, a XVII / XVIIIc. Slovak highlander, leader of Carpathian brigands. In Poland the legend was revived by a popular TV series from 1970s, making him a fictional XIXc. gallant folk hero, who only robs the rich Austrian nobles to help oppressed local peasants, \"Robin Hood way\".</p>",

The main goal requires carrying safely a specified number of penguins from home to another igloo within designated time. To do so it's necessary to cover (by moving joystick in a direction of referred arrow) a hole in the ice each time a little penguin is close by. The hole remains covered for only 3 seconds. Completion of the task requires sending a few penguins at the same time, starting and finishing in different igloos. Following the corresponding arrows and releasing the penguins at the right time is the key to complete the level.</p>",

The game is entirely played with joysticks where jabbing is done by pushing the button while hooks, blocks and ducking is done by pulling the stick. For each punch landed the player earns points. A normal punch is worth two points while a punch that forces the opponent back is worth five points. After a knockdown the player earns ten points and one point for every second that the opponent is down. If the opponent doesn't get up, the player will win the match.</p>",

This is a puzzle platformer game, and this is meant literally: the world has to be manipulated like a sliding tile puzzle in order to be able to reach the keys. Each tile is about one screen big, with floors where you can walk, and a number of exits. </p>\n<p>Holding down the fire button brings up an overview of the level where you can manipulate tiles to join the appropriate corridors. Some places require tricky workarounds to be able to enter. </p>\n<p>There are some hazards, like falling into a pit that joins to nowhere, or touching a cactus. These result to teleport you onto the starting point, but you have endless lives. The levels also can be accessed via a password system.</p>",

The king has been executed and his son is banished into prison since a decade now. Hope seems lost until someone frees the king's son and prisoners. It is time to claim back the land! </p>\n<p>In-game, the first click reveals yellow tiles around the selected unit that tell where it can go in the current turn. The second click reveals brown blocks in proximity - these tell where or what can the unit attack. Click on a yellow square and the unit goes there. Click on a brown square and the unit may attack. </p>\n<p>After you have done your moves, holding the fire button ends your turn and the AI makes its own. There are close range and artillery units, each one with different statistics like health, strength, shielding, speed. Lord units can make others stronger if they are nearby. </p>\n<p>There are a variety of missions, like escaping from prison, open field battles, city siege, and more. Features include 23 levels, 26 different kind of units (swordsmen, bowmen, mages, catapults, beasts, etc), and a challenging AI player. Furthermore, there is a story line with cutscenes and dialogs, and a tutorial. Your progress gets saved automatically.</p>",

Differently arranged pieces (one at a time) are slowly falling into a pit, and you have to manage them around until they reach a stationary state at the bottom of the free space. When the tiles constitute complete rows, those rows disappear and you get points for it. If there are gaps in the rows, the pieces pile up, and the game ends if the pile reaches the top of the pit. There is a window that shows you the following piece. You can move the pieces horizontally, rotate them, or make them fall faster while holding the fire button.</p>\n<p>Distinctive features are: There are some unusual pieces with 3 to 5 tiles. The game is separated into rounds. There is a meter that advances when you make complete rows, and the round ends when the meter reaches maximum. There is also a selection of tunes, and a randomly chosen one plays during the round. The graphics around the playfield uses an interlacing trick.</p>",

To deactivate a component, shoot at the robot with a missile that has the colour you want to deactivate. For example, to deactivate a red robot, shoot at him with a red missile; to deactivate a cyan robot, shoot at him with a blue missile and than a green missile (or vice versa); to deactivate a white robot, shoot at him with red, green and blue missiles consecutively in any order. You can change your missiles' colour at the recalibrators or by picking up certain bonuses. There are 8 levels in the game with increasing width and complexity, including the single-screen introductory level 0. When you run out of energy, the game is over.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Energy Czar</em> is an educational simulation game where the president of the United States gives the player full power to guide the country through an energy crisis. The player has full control over eight energy resources: coal, oil, natural gas, uranium, hydroelectric power, solar power, wind power and biomass. It is possible to promote or restrict each resource, ration them, change their taxes and regulate their prices as well as changing environmental controls.</p>\n<p>To keep the job, it is necessary to keep people happy and make enough energy available so that the demand is met. Failing to do so leads to the player being fired. A public opinion poll appears every five years and rates the player's accomplishments within three areas: economy growth, inflation and deaths from accidents and pollution. To stay in power it is necessary to get at least a 20% rating in each category and 30% overall. To win the game the player needs to get an approval rating of at least 75% and will then be given the title of National Hero.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Mar Tesoro (which is Spanish for Sea Treasure) is a game which simulates the search for sunken treasure. You start with $10,000 with which you must hire a boat, crew and equipment of various sorts from the main port of \"The Island\". Then you can explore and bring back any treasure that you find.</p>\n<p>In port, you can hire a boat and select the type of equipment to use (scuba, diving rig or a diving bell). These allow you to reach treasure at increasing depths. You can also hire a historian who can estimate the worth of a treasure by a sample retrieved by the diver, without having to recover the entire treasure. Additional crew can be hired to assist in salvage operations. Once the daily hire charge and time has been determined, you can set out on your expedition.</p>\n<p>On leaving port, you may choose to look at the chart which shows the randomly generated island, the surrounding sea, and previously dropped buoys. You can move the ship, represented by an asterisk, from square to square in four directions. Movement uses time, which is shown below the chart. If you exceed the agreed upon rental time you will be nabbed by the coast guard. Other randomly occurring incidents such as bad weather and engine trouble may also use time.</p>\n<p>Once you have decided upon a spot to search, you may dive. This brings up a side view of the scene. You control the diver, who must visit the ocean floor and return a sample of any possible treasure. Treasure, which ranges from a shipwreck to an oyster bed with pearls, usually appears a different colour from the rest of the sea floor. It may also be guarded by a giant squid, which must be avoided, or you will lose a worker or perhaps your own life. Having brought the sample back to the boat, you have the option of retrieving the treasure. The historian (if you have one) will offer an opinion on the likelihood of a good treasure. The time it takes to retrieve a treasure depends on the depth. If you don't have enough time, you can mark the site with a buoy and continue elsewhere.</p>\n<p>After returning to port, you are offered money for all of your recovered treasures. Then you may either leave the game (and get your final rating), or continue the game to look for even greater fortune.</p>",

The aim is to reach the exit of each of eleven levels, while collecting crystals, keys for opening doors, and avoiding roving monsters or other obstacles. Contact with monsters results in your health-bar depleting, and when it is reduced to zero, then you lose a life. Extra lives are gained by exiting a dungeon, collecting 30 gems, or collecting all of the gems in a level. Energy can be replenished by collecting food items.</p>\n<p>The player can walk left or right, or can fire a laser weapon which has a limited range. The player also has a gravity pod, activated by moving \"up\". This allows the players to jump any distance from a standing position, including between levels of the dungeon. Moving between levels causes all of the monsters to re-spawn. The player can duck by pressing down. Once per level, the player can activate a short-lived invulnerability mode, which also allows the player to fly (effectively using the gravity pod, while in mid-jump) and kill monsters on contact for about 10 seconds.</p>\n<p>The game has two difficulty levels. The harder level requires all gems to be collected before leaving the dungeon.</p>",

Otherwise is is possible to either check the active enemy athlete or change the controlled athlete, either by automatically going to the one nearest to the puck or making an exact selection.</p>\n<p>The available options are the length of the thirds (two, five or twenty minutes) and the strength of the computer AI in three steps. The up to four (two on Atari 1200XL) players can be freely divided between the two teams.</p>",

You control a group of Robot Knights who have travelled back in time to hunt him down, before he can complete the monster he is creating.</p>\n<p>Robot Knights is a platform game where you choose to control one of two types of knight. One carries a shield; the other a bow. The aim is to collect all of the objects (such as energy capsules) and defeat all of the fireball throwing creatures on the screen. The creatures may only be defeated by reflecting a fireball back at them. This may be done by blocking a fireball with the shield, or shooting it with the arrow. However contact with a fireball will reduce the player's energy, as will contact with one of the creatures. Once the player's energy is depleted, the game is lost. After each screen is completed, a door opens allowing the player to progress to the next room of the scientist's lair.</p>",

Finally the player must navigate a complex asteroid field to reach the next infested planet. </p>\n<p>This is a side-scrolling shooter.

You must pilot your vessel across enemy terrain at night, avoiding their powerful land-based defenses as you lay destruction upon the occupying forces. Players must move quickly, warping in and out of hyperdrive to surprise their foe, and then laying destruction upon alien infrastructure with your powerful dual ion cannons. </p>\n<p>You maneuver their ship left and right over hostile alien terrain. If you are hit by enemy fire you lose a life, and you start with a total of 3 lives. As you play, your ship will continuously lose fuel, which can be replenished by shooting alien fuel storage containers. Points are awarded for destroying alien structures and vessels, including: tanks, bridges, radar towers, saucers, train cars, missiles, space planes, fuel depots, and missile silos. At the end of each stage, the player must destroy an alien base. After this, they will progress to a more difficult level, where fuel depletes more rapidly. After defeating the first 5 stages and gaining the rank of commander, the player will gain an extra life</p>",

If the player falls from any height, even 1 pixel, they will lose a life. </p>\n<p>After ascending 9 rooms, the player will reach the top of the building, where they must catch a balloon and float to safety.

A level is completed by removing all radioactive waste, and a counter in the bottom of the screen tracks how much waste and enemies are remaining. </p>\n<p>There are 3 types of enemies. Nuke, who absorbs power from nuclear waste. Nuke follows the player, and can only be destroyed when enough radioactive waste has been cleared. Phantom, who moves incessantly in a straight line. Phantom moves through walls with ease, but bounces off the outer rim of the level. Minelayer, who moves throughout the level placing mines. If the player shoots a mine, it will start a fire, which can spread through a level. </p>\n<p>There are a total of 15 different difficulty levels. At higher levels, fires spread faster and enemy creatures move faster. The player has a total of 3 lives per level, and if they are struck by enemy creatures they will lose a life.</p>",

The player must navigate numerous racing challenges, including: bridges, chicanes, barricades, narrow roads, and boulder fields. As the game progresses, the speed of the vehicle increases, making the game more challenging. In 2-player mode, vehicles can collide with each other, and players can work cooperatively, or try to push their opponent off of the road. Dirt, water, and oil slicks can cause vehicles to lose control. If a player hits any solid object, their vehicle is destroyed. </p>\n<p>In 1-player mode, the player starts with 3 cars. In 2-player mode, each player starts with 5 cars. Points are rewarded for distance traveled, and every 100 points rewards an additional car. When all cars are lost, it's game over.</p>",

The player controls a space ship with a simple task: kill all alien invaders. The ship is restricted to horizontal movement on the lower part of the screen - while the enemy formation sticks to the same movement pattern, occasionally one or more ships break out and attack the player directly. If they (or one of their shots) hits the player ship, one of the three lives is lost. Additional lives are earned after 7000 points are earned or after a set amount of levels is passed.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to achieve a high score; the four kinds of enemy ships give a different amount of points. When they are attacking, their point worth is doubled. The three difficulty levels can be set before beginning a game or it automatically increases after ten levels have been finished. Level two makes enemies faster and level three your own shots slower. Multiplayer is a high-score comparison.</p>",

Armed with only a sprayer can of DDT, you must defend yourself from these rampaging insects. </p>\n<p>The player controls a chemical sprayer, which can be moved on all four outer edges of the gameplay window. The sprayer will always point towards the center of the screen, where your garden resides. Insects will randomly stream out of the garden, and you must kill them by spraying them with DDT. Every 3 rounds, night will fall, and the army will drop you two new cans of DDT. There are a variety of insects encountered. Moths are harmless, but will try to form cocoons on the edge of the screen, blocking your spraying. Cocoons can be destroyed, but not if they're formed in the corners of the map. Bees attack in force, and prevent your spray from reaching more deadly bugs. There are also insects that will inhabit the corners of the screen, and will destroy the player if they come in contact. At night, butterflies appear, which reward the player bonus points for every corner that has remained free.</p>\n<p>When the player is hit, they will lose their current can of DDT from their sprayer, and a second can will be thrown to the center of the garden, destroying all bugs on the map. Although the player starts with 6 cans of DDT, they in reality have 3 lives. When all lives are lost, it's game over.</p>",

Up and coming prepester Wadsworth thought he had it all, until an initiation stunt gone wrong left him in trouble with the top fraternity on campus. After barely escaping his banishment retrieving balls from a golf course of hellish design in <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/59415/preppie/\">Preppie!</a></em>, Wadsworth must now compete in a new challenge to advance to the next level of fraternity consideration.</p>\n<p>Wadsworth is armed with a cloak which makes him invulnerable to enemy attack for a limited period of time each level. Each level of difficulty consists of 3 rooms separated by a doorway. The goal is to walk over all areas of the map to turn them purple. When all squares are colored in all 3 rooms, the player advances to the next level. Room 1 and 3 features frogs which continuously try to hop towards the player. They can be avoided by using spinning doors to block the frogs' path. The 2nd room features several horizontal passageways, from which lawnmowers continuously scroll from the left or the right. The player must use interconnecting pathways to avoid this danger. </p>\n<p>Between levels, players are treated to a brief intermission involving an alligator. After each level, the dangers move at a faster rate. The player has a total of 3 lives, and if all are lost, it's game over.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Angle Worms</em> is a two-player arcade game.</p>\n<p>Both players control a continuously moving and elongating worm. The two players compete on a screen with multiple obstacles to see who can grow the longest worm. If the player comes in contact with an obstacle or a piece of an elongating worm, they lose the match. The longer a player survives, the more points they get for winning that match. Each player gets a limited number of shots, which can be used to shorten a worm if they cut off their own tail. The game ends when one player reaches the predetermined score at the beginning of the match.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Jantor is the name of the harsh and desolate planet that lies half in this dimension, and half in another. The strangeness of this shadow world is a result of the presence of large quantities of tricasmium; a rare ore with subtle and unusual properties. A Rigillian fleet has been sent to conquer Jantor, and only your Space Hornet interceptor can stop it.</p>\n<p><em>Shadow World</em> is a mostly side-scrolling shooter, ala <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Defender\">Defender</a>. Rigillian crystal ships slowly descend from the sky, and can only be defeated by having their central core destroyed using your interceptor's plasmatronic cannons. These crystal ships deploy a skimmer, which retrieves tricasmium from the surface, allowing the ships to descend safely. They also deploy guardian drones which act as escorts. Once a crystal ship reaches the surface of the planet, it becomes a colonizer and impervious to weapon fire. The colonizers can only be inactivated by picking up a tricasmium nugget and then flying over the entrance of the colonizer.</p>\n<p>Your interceptor is armed with a small number of smart bombs, which obliterates enemies on the screen and returns you to your base. Successful destruction of each waves of ships rewards you with another smart bomb. Armed with cannons and these bombs, you must prevent five active crystal ships from landing, or the entire planet will be sucked into a temporal vortex.</p>",

Gameplay is entirely via joystick, and the player must maneuver around the castle to gather items to power up their character, including: a glistening silver cross, a magic book, a powerful staff, and a magical ring. As well, they must collect keys to unlock the many doors through the castle. The ultimate goal is to retrieve their mind's eye, located within the Tunnel of Death, and return it to the iron door which slammed behind you when first entering the twisted world of the subconscious. The player has an 8-hour time limit, representing a full night's sleep, to escape the castle still alive. </p>\n<p>The game contains a combat system, and the player is warned when enemies are nearby. Monsters present on the map will move incessantly towards the player. When the player is engaged, they can choose to either flee or enter combat. The game rolls a random damage value for the player and monster based upon items collected and power-ups discovered. Battle success is based upon when the player stops the random dice roll.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Dr. Goodcode is occupied with new and grand pursuits. Thus, he has commissioned you with cleaning out the monster infestation in the basement of his mansion because since moving into the mansion one year ago, they have continued to interfere with his research. The basement of the mansion was once of grand design, with each room painted a different color, and designed by some of the greatest architects of the age. Home of the great wizard Johnny, the wizard did not trust banks, so had created a menagerie of monsters to protect his significant wealth. You have answered Dr. Goodcode's call for an exterminator, and must plumb the depths of the dungeon to destroy all the monsters within. </p>\n<p><em>Dr. Goodcode's Cavern</em> is a text-based RPG, where the player must explore a number of rooms with differing text descriptions. The player can find gold and other items as they explore. Each room is numbered, and a compass shows which room lies in which direction. They will intermittently encounter monsters, which can be either bribed, attacked, fled from, or zapped. Bribing uses up gold. In combat, the player and monster take turns striking each other, where damage is determined by your character's strength and equipment. The character levels up as they are victorious in combat. The zap ability can only be used 3 times per game, but will instantly kill any monster. The goal is to hunt down and destroy all monsters within the dungeon.</p>",

The player can redirect its movement by pressing the \"/\" key, which creates a slanted border which redirects the ball's movement. The goal is to collect the icons spread throughout the screen, by directing the ball onto their location. The player's score is based upon the number of bounces and borders required to collect the icons. The ball can become lodged in the far corners, creating an unwinnable situation.</p>\n<p><em>Simon Says</em> is a memory game, where the player must remember a sequence of flashing lights labeled 1 to 5. Every 4 turns, one more light flashes, creating an increased difficulty level. The game ends when the player has incorrectly remembered 3 sequences.</p>",

A fox-like creature at the top of the screen will randomly place eggs upon a conveyor belt from the egg stash in the top left corner. These eggs will then fall through the conveyor belt, and the player must catch them in their cart by moving horizontally. There are a total of 15 egg drops per level, and after 15 drops the player moves to a harder difficulty level. If the player drops an egg, the farmer comes and takes their cart, and the player loses a life. If 3 eggs are dropped, it's game over.</p>",

The character has a single golf club, which can swing in a 360 degree arc. The power of the player's swing is based upon how far of an arc the club goes through prior to connecting with the ball, and the direction of the swing is dependent upon the angle the club connects with the ball. There are a total of 18 holes, which contain basic hazards including trees, sandtraps, and water. When the player places the ball on the green, the player enters a zoomed-in view of the putting green, but still positions and swings their club in the same manner. The game keeps track of the score through 18 holes.</p>",

A picture is split into a number of separate tiles, from 4 - 64, and randomly shuffled. The player must restore the individual photo by sliding the rows and columns of tile pieces. Initially came with 3 photos: deer, cube, and desert. The game tracks the number of moves made to solve a puzzle, and the player can save a puzzle in progress.</p>\n<p><em>Maxwell's Demon</em> is based upon the second law of thermodynamics, but in this case the goal is to prove it wrong. The player controls James Clerk Maxwell's imaginary demon which sits upon the gate of separation between two molecules, by attempting to separate a system of fast moving hydrogen and slow moving helium atoms by opening and closing a gate that separates two chambers. The gate can be moved vertically, and can be briefly opened to allow molecules through. The goal is to separate all the atoms in the system.</p>",

All commands are via text input, and there are a total of 9 different difficulty levels. The player's goal is to warp between sectors to find and destroy enemy vessels. The player is armed with phasers and torpedoes to engage Klingon vessels, and will also take ship damage from alien vessels during battle. The player has limited energy to travel and engage in combat, as well as a limited time period, and if either are depleted, it is game over. Thus, the player must carefully manage travel times versus energy cost, as well as the time and energy spent engaged in battle and repairs in order to destroy all Klingon vessels.</p>",

Ducks will intermittently take flight, and if not shot immediately, will gobble up the player's bullets. There is a small row of pipes in the top of the screen. The value of these are based upon how many shots the player has taken in that game, decreasing by 10 points per bullet used. Stars and targets will appear on the screen, which reward the player with more bullets of shot, but are not worth points.

You hop into your speedster to blast these creatures, but beware of dangers including monster eggs ready to hatch and holes in the concrete. You must rid your town of these monsters and save your community. </p>\n<p>The player drives a small vehicle which can move in the 4 cardinal directions, but can only turn 90 degrees at a time. The vehicle has 2 separate speeds. You also have a small cannon which can fire forwards to destroy monsters. The game is played in a small town, which loops to the north and south. The player has limited fuel, but will gain more when they lose a life or destroy monster eggs. A small map shows the location of all monster eggs prior to hatching, and the resultant monster. The goal is to destroy all these creatures, to advance to a more challenging stage where fuel depletes more quickly. </p>\n<p>If the player strikes buildings, trees, or monsters, they lose a life. 3 lives lost, and it's game over. A bonus car is awarded every 10,000 points.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Survival of the Fittest</em> is a 1-player or competitive 2-player strategy game based on cellular biology for the Atari 400/800.</p>\n<p>The player attempts to create a colony of cells which must be arrayed in a specific pattern to promote optimal cellular growth. Players take turns either laying down cell pattern, watching growth of colonies, and then laying down more cellular tissue based upon the pattern that develops. Cells that are placed too close together will choke out growth, while cells that are positioned too sparsely will die out. Opposing team cells will inhibit growth of their opponent. </p>\n<p>There is an option for single-player practice sessions, 2-player competition where cells cannot interact, and 2-player competitions where cells interact on the same field. In single-player mode, the player can place infinite cells. In a competitive game, each player as an initial timed setup phase where they establish their colony. The game then varies between a growth phase where colonies mutate and seeds regenerate, and a modification phase where accumulated cells can be placed. The winner is the player with the most cells at the end of the timed period. </p>\n<p>There are 6 game options affecting cell growth: normal, handicap, solid walls, fast, wild, and slow.</p>",

The player can fire rapidly vertically towards the top of the screen. A large centipede starts at the top of the screen and moves horizontally in rows towards the player. The centipede breaks into segments when shot, and the player moves to a more challenging level every time a centipede is destroyed. Further complicating the player's task are Dweebs which fall directly towards the player, and Squirtles which hop about the screen. If the player is struck by any of these enemies, they lose a life. The field regularly fills with mushrooms which serve to block the player's firing and monster movement. The player starts with 3 lives, and gains an additional life every 10,000 points.</p>",

On the bottom of the screen are a limited number of power packs.  A player must grab a power pack to have the energy to fire, and every shot will reduce their energy supply.</p>\n<p>A red snake-like figure moves about the screen in a Qix-like fashion. It has eyes that can be shot for points, and at higher levels a spinning tail that will break off and fly about the screen like a boomerang. As it moves, it drops green bugs that descend and attempt to steal your limited power packs. If it grabs one of these, they can be shot, but the player must be careful not to be hit by the falling pack.  If the player shoots the red snake, a bouncing bomb will drop at the player and threaten them.  When a player has lost all power packs, it's game over.</p>",

Willy must stabilize his home and destroy the enemy eggs laid throughout. The player controls Willy, a small creature with a large prehensile tongue. At the beginning of each level, the player faces off against a large centipede, and the player must grab pieces with their tongue. Any sections that escape then roams through the level to harass the player as they explore their home. The player is also at danger from gnashing teeth which roam the level and environmental dangers. In each stage, the player must use their tongue to grab a hard hat from flying birds. This hat protects for 1 hit against monsters, but is also required to smash eggs through the level. There are also sections of wall which need to be stabilized by walking past them. When all walls are stabilized and eggs are smashed the player progresses the next level. Each level makes a slight alteration to the map, which opens up new larger areas to explore, and more wall to stabilize. The player starts with 9 lives, and when all are lost it's game over.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Hazard Run</em> is a 1-player racing game for the Atari 400/800.</p>\n<p>Loosely based upon the TV show <em>The Dukes of Hazard</em>, the player controls a large red vehicle as they race through the backwoods avoiding police cars. The vehicle can move horizontally left and right. The car continuously accelerates until the player hits an object, at which point the player loses a vehicle and their speed is reset to zero. If the player runs close to an object, their car will flip onto 2 wheels, and the player must steer down, or the car will flip. The player has limited gas, and must pick up gas tanks to complete longer races. The player must avoid a number of hazards, including: trees, fences, police barricades, rocks, walls, chickens, deer, and lakes. At the end of every level, the player attempts to jump across a river. If they have enough speed, they will clear the canyon, as they watch the police crash into the river behind them. The player starts with 5 vehicles, and when all are lost it's game over. Contains 4 tracks of increasing difficulty: Chicken Run, Walton Wood, Bryan's Pond, and Hell's Canyon.</p>",

Each team has a small net which continues to scroll vertically across the sides of the screen. 4 points are rewarded every time a shot is scored. Gameplay options allow the player to define the time per game and number of players. Each player controls one insect on the field at a time, and can pass or shoot. The player who next gets the ball becomes the active player. The defensive player can intercept passes or kicks, and can take the ball away from player who has the ball. The game has basic rules for a ball going offside, where it is returned to the opposing team. At the end of regulation time, the player with the most points wins. If it is a tie, the players go to sudden death overtime.</p>",

There are 3 defensive shields which can block the aliens' or player's shots. The player's goal is to shoot all alien vessels on the screen, but as the player destroys enemies, the speed of ship movement increases, increasing difficulty. Alien saucers arrive and supply more combatants if they are not shot down. On later levels, invaders split in two when shot, and both craft must be destroyed independently. The player starts with 3 lives, but it's game over if all lives are lost or if the invaders reach the bottom of the screen. The player gains an extra life every 10,000 points. The player can start at any of 9 difficulty levels, and each stage is progressively more difficult.</p>",

In a 1-player game, the player controls the submarine <em>Nautilus</em>, and must avoid depth charges dropped by the destroyer <em>Colossus</em> above. In a 2-player game, the second player controls the destroyer, and attempts to hinder the first player's progress. </p>\n<p>The <em>Nautilus</em> is equipped with Thunderbolt torpedoes, which are used to destroy underwater cities and collect the Proto-Energy Pods at their center, and power the sub's engines. These torpedoes are also used to defend against enemy attacks. The destroyer's purpose is to transfer city repair crews from the right to the left side of the screen, while avoiding attacks from the submarine and its support helicopter. It is further armed with depth charges and Barracuda torpedoes to defend itself, but if it is damaged it will automatically return to the right of the screen for repairs. When repair crews are successfully transferred, an underwater city is rebuilt, scoring the second player 100 points. A further danger for the submarine is Limpet Lurkets, autonomous droids which inhabit the depths and seek out the submarine.</p>\n<p>The destroyer is armed with sonar, which tells the player when they are above the submarine, to encourage the dropping of weapons. There are 9 difficulty levels, and gameplay is timed, with the winner being the one with the most points at the end of a session.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A 2D side-scrolling shooter where you must explore caves to find the three pieces of the crown for the king. The large playfield is notable for an enormous amount of movement, with flowing water and swaying vines. Hidden triggers will cause explosions or lightning bolts to strike that will injure the player, as well as falling stones, and two dreaded birds that keep spawning to harass you. The player looks like they are riding on a stork and have a lance, similar to the characters in Joust, though the translated story says you are on a winged horse.</p>\n<p>Though the game is short, it is known for being very difficult. It has three difficulty levels, named slightly different depending on translation, corresponding to easy, medium, and hard, which controls how regularly the explosions and lightning bolts go off, as well as the speed the birds spawn and move.\nIn two-player mode, the controls for movement and shooting are distributed between the players.</p>\n<p>The game was released in Germany, but Wikipedia offers a rough translation of the story in the game:\nThe player controls the hero Telos on his winged horse Pegamis and has to explore two caves within a large scrolling playfield. While exploring the caves the player is threatened by flying creatures called \"Nemesides\" that appear occasionally.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The castle of Schreckenstein has been taken over by black sorcerers and creatures of the underworld. The magical eyes of the Necropolis ward off visitors to the castle, but it might just be possible for one or two brave souls to enter the castle dungeons. And with the help of the white sorcerers, perhaps they can restore peace to the castle.</p>\n<p>Schreckenstein is a platform maze game designed to be played by two players, with each player's surroundings shown in either the top or bottom half of the screen. If a single player is selected, the computer operates the second player. In each level, the players must traverse the maze collecting health elixirs and level specific objects while avoiding spooks, bats, spiders and miscellaneous traps. Each player can throw a weapon to dispatch their enemies.</p>\n<p>On each level, the collected objects are either used to activate sites or give them to a white sorcerer for use. When enough have been collected, a key appears somewhere, and once collected this allows the door to the next level to be opened. For the first level, the players collect torches and use them to activate giant skulls. On the second level, gems are collected for the white sorcerer, who appears randomly and infrequently as a ghostly apparition. On the third level, tokens must be deposited into magical wells. On the fourth level, the player must again collect crystals but they are enchanted, and cannot be picked up unless the player is first given the ability by a white sorcerer. In the final level, the players must find magic eyes for the white sorcerer.</p>\n<p>Each player has a health meter, which trickles down with time or drops after contact with a monster. Once the energy reaches zero, the player dies. If this happens to the computer or in two player mode, the first player to die eventually re-animates as an undead creature who pursues the other player. If the living player completes a level, their companion is given extra energy and returned to life with a small amount of energy for the next level.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Space Cowboy</em> is an arcade game for the Atari 8-bit systems.</p>\n<p>In the galactic year 7401, a free-roving private spacer, known as a Space Cowboy, landed his vessel on the feudal planet Dungeon. Space Cowboy was looking for adventure; he was not expecting to be arrested on false charges as soon as he landed his ship. Before being incarcerated in the cells of Castle Langour, Space Cowboy did manage to seal his ship so that it would open only to his body aura pattern. For three years Space Cowboy was a restless prisoner planning an escape to his waiting ship, to lift off and find a more cordial planet. Finally the moment to escape arrived and Space Cowboy broke out of the castle. But, there was still the gauntlet ahead of him.</p>\n<p>The player must move along the narrow ramparts of the castle, avoiding a number of lasers which fire from the left hand side of the screen. The player must time their moves carefully to not get shot, and they are also at danger of falling off the ramparts. The player starts with 10 stamina, and every time time they are hit or fall off a platform, they lose a point. If the player loses all of their stamina, it's game over. The game shows the player's speed and the distance to their awaiting space ship on the bottom of the screen.</p>",

Many years ago, a lone thief defiantly entered the tomb of Pharaoh Ickabathan and stole the two rubies which had been placed as the eyes of the mummy. The thief, however, became hopelessly lost trying to escape the tomb of death, and in the process, dropped the rubies. Sightless, the mummy instinctively sprang to life and sought out the intruder, viciously slaying him on the staircase. Avenged, the mummy returned to its sarcophagus, but placed a curse upon the land until its eyes should be returned.</p>\n<p>The player must enter the pyramid, and explore in search of the two lost gemstones. These must be returned to the mummy, to lift the curse that haunts the land. All items and locations are graphically displayed on the screen. The player must type in all commands as a single word, and there are several inventory based puzzles. There is no save or restore feature.</p>",

Your character can only carry one item at a time, but there are a shield, sword, speed wedge, three keys, a holy hand grenade, and the titular Holy Grail to pick up. The shield defends you from taking any damage, the sword can face left or right and kills any enemies but the moth if you touch it with it. There are about 100 rooms.</p>",

Rare letters are worth more that way. Letters' frequencies also determine how quickly their meters fill. Every third word you enter takes you to the next level, where points are multiplied, but meters also fill more quickly.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Wingman</em> is a split-screen side-scrolling flight game for one to four players.</p>\n<p>Played from a split-screen perspective, two planes fly independently. In a single-player game, the second plane is controlled by the computer and aids the player. With more players, players can choose to play cooperatively or compete against each other. One team controls five sectors on the left of the gameplay area, while the other team controls five sectors on the right, with two empty sectors in between. If the wingman is computer controlled, he can be given different control instructions, such as defending friendly territory, attacking enemy territory or protecting the human player. </p>\n<p>Planes can be armed with high-explosive bombs, air-to-air missiles, or 20 mm cannons. These have different efficiencies against ground and air targets, and also heavier weapons slow the plane's speed. The player scores points by destroying enemy aircraft and ground installations, with buildings further into enemy territory worth more points. Each team is provided 3 flight squadrons (2 aircraft) to try to maximize their score, and in versus games, the player who scores the most points is victorious.</p>",

A white treasure energizer, or bouncing ball, moves about the screen collecting points and eliminating blocks as it hits waves and jewels. The player controls a probe which can be raised, lowered, and moved laterally to help direct the energizer. The probe can be destroyed by being struck by a mine. The player also controls a minesweep, represented by a red object at the top of the screen, which can be moved laterally. If the energizer hits the minesweep, it is destroyed, and the player has a total of 5 energizers per game. Intermittently mines will raise from the ocean depths, and if these are captured by the minesweep, the player will gain bonus time to capture jewels. The game is over when time runs out or all energizers are lost.</p>",

The player must avoid the dangers of a busy highway, by moving precariously between cars. They must then avoid unsteady trashbins, and cross on logs across a fast flowing river, to ultimately enter a small cave at the top left of the map. As the player moves, the map is constantly shifting. Flies buzz around the screen, which can be picked up for bonus points. The player has three lives per game, and it's over when these are lost.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Air Raid!</em> is a side-scrolling shooter which puts you in control of an aircraft and charged with the task of defending a city against waves of incoming bombers. Each level starts with your plane fully fueled and loaded with ammo, waiting for take-off. The bombers appear on radar in the distance to your left, and you must destroy them all before they take out your radar and both of your landing areas.</p>\n<p>There are a total of nine levels, or \"strikes\" of increasing difficulty. On the first, there are only a small number of bombers, which cannot return fire. Subsequent levels have increasing numbers of bombers, some of which can shoot back. Later levels also introduce fighter escorts which move faster than the bombers and will change course to intercept you. Each level consists of two waves, with the second wave appearing only after the first has been cleared from the air. After the ninth strike, the final level repeats until all of your planes are destroyed.</p>\n<p>Flying uses fuel, and shooting reduces ammunition. These can be replenished, up to a maximum of 100 units each, by landing on one of your air bases. Whilst flying, you also have the option of dropping an external fuel-tank. This decreases your fuel to 50, thereby reducing your flight time but also improving the speed of your aircraft.</p>",

The player must engage Vegan battleships in strategy-based space combat. A difficulty level from 1-50 is available for the player. </p>\n<p>The player must navigate to a number of star sectors using their warp engines to destroy all Vegan vessels. Within a sector, ship navigation can be automatic or manual by selecting thrust level and direction in 360 degrees. </p>\n<p>The player 's ship is armed with positron lasers and a meson cannon for offense. A limited crew supply is available, and they are lost as the ship is damaged, and cannot be replenished. Shields help protect the vessel and limit crew fatalities when powered. When no enemies are present, the player can launch probes to investigate the local sector. </p>\n<p>The player has the option to manually control power distribution of their vessel or allow the computer to automatically do this. The player's vessel has 4 separate shield and positron laser positions, as well as slots for the meson cannons, ion engine, light engine, and batteries. The player must redistribute power to these different ship sections to optimize ship performance. The ultimate goal is to defeat all Vegan ships present in space.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A group of spelunkers has been trapped underground on a strange planet. Your goal is to use a mechanical auger to burrow a tunnel from one side of the screen to the next to allow the group to get closer to safety. The escape needs to take place within a certain time, which is marked by the movement of the sun and moon. The fire button switches control between the auger and the fleeing human. Once all humans have been rescued, play continues in the next level or \"quadrant\".</p>\n<p>Thwarting your plans for escape is an alien bird, who flies overhead and has two special powers. It can launch magna-titanium rods which penetrate the planet's crust and may either kill a human or block their path. It can also hatch a number of smaller probe-birds. These probe-birds can launch their own attack. They can deploy a nuclear rod through the rock, and once encountering a tunnel can release a space-fungus. The fungus is made of a relatively hard material, and grows haphazardly within the tunnel, blocking it.</p>\n<p>There are two other important aspects of the game: boulders and bombs. Boulders appear randomly throughout each quadrant. They are made out of a super-hard rock which is extremely difficult to drill through, but also almost impenetrable by the nuclear rods of the probe birds. The part of a tunnel drilled under a boulder is therefore relatively safe. The cave explorers also start off with a number of bombs. If a bomb is deployed near the end of one of the nuclear rods, before it deploys the fungus, then the probe-bird above will be killed by the explosion. Extra bombs can be found floating around the tunnels in each quadrant.</p>\n<p>A bonus life is given at the end of five successful quadrants, and there are a total of 99. There is also a multiplayer mode, where each additional player controls one of the three probe birds trying to destroy the first player.</p>",

Each turn, the player is able to drop fire retardant, set up a ground crew, and dig a fire break. The goal is to minimize property damage to the surrounding countryside. The player takes a significant financial hit if the governor's mansion burns down, and if the fuel depot catches on fire all nearby areas ignite. If the supply base burns, then resources to fight the fire become more scarce. Wind conditions will affect the direction of spread and the speed of the fire.</p>\n<p>The player can select stable, unstable, or very unstable wind patterns, and can also start a game with a fire caused by a mild, moderate, or severe thunderstorm.

        "description": "<p><em>The Rings of the Empire</em> is an arcade game for the Atari 8-bit computer.</p>\n<p>The Empire has developed a series of robot-controlled battle stations called Rings. Each station is protected by one or more rings of energy, and they have been placed at strategic points throughout the galaxy to monitor and destroy all unauthorized movement. If they are not destroyed soon, they will doom the Rebellion.</p>\n<p>You will attack the stations in your Y-wing fighter, which is armed with zydon torpedoes. The rings are a series of counterclockwise rotating shields which can be destroyed by a direct torpedo hit. \n The player must blow away layers of the shield to ultimately aim a shot at the well-protected station within. One hit, and the station is destroyed. You must combat a series of stations with progressively more rings up to 4 rings in total. </p>\n<p>Each station is armed with a negi laser, which tracks the player, and drains a small amount of energy with each hit. The player's total energy is displayed on the side of the screen. Whenever a shield segment is destroyed, a powerful segfire missile is released, which will obliterate the player's ship if it connects. After 6 - 10 ring segments are destroyed, segfire missiles will begin to track the player. The player can shoot down these missiles, but also 4 times per game can warp off one side of the screen and appear on the other. If the player's ship is destroyed, it's game over.</p>",

Matter can neither be created nor controlled, but it can be converted into energy, and through this process dissipated. Certain planets have consumed almost all of their energy producing materials, and are in desperate need of fuel replacement. Your assignment is to deliver a massive \"energy capsule\" to each of these planets before their fuel runs out and the inhabitants are frozen to death.</p>\n<p>From the navigation screen, the player must move to all 4 planets present on the space chart. Each quadrant has unique dangers including empty space, asteroids, Mondrogor Starfighters, and the planets themselves. The arcade portion is played from a top-down perspective, where the player controls a yellow starship that can move in all directions. The screen and dangers scroll vertically from above. A small green energy capsule is also present on the screen. The player's only ability is to make the capsule move towards the player, by pressing the joystick button. If the capsule touches the starship or any other object on the screen, the player loses a life. Furthermore, if the starship comes in contact with any enemy other than Mondrogor Starfighters, which directly try to attack the energy capsule, the player loses a life. The player has 5 lives, and if all are lost, it's game over.</p>",

Krell ships move horizontally, and fire towards the player. After the five defending ships are destroyed, the player must quickly use their tractor beam to capture the rapidly scrolling starbase, or the Krell will transform it into a Krell Battlestation and destroy the player. </p>\n<p>The player has 5 ships, and loses one with each hit.

Gameplay occurs in outer space and on an alien planet. The player has a limited fuel supply, and fuel can only be acquired by landing on these alien planets. On the alien planets, the screen scrolls vertically from above, and the player can cruise at either high or low altitude, but can only acquire fuel at a low altitude. At low altitude, dangers including turrets and enemy fighters are present, but there are fewer dangers higher up. After acquiring sufficient fuel, the player can once again enter outer space. Back in space, the player must destroy a select number of alien fighters as demonstrated in the top right of the screen. After destroying these, a warp gate opens, which allows the player to progress to the next level. A compass on the bottom of the screen shows the direction to the fuel planet or warp gate.</p>",

A temperature gauge on the bottom of the screen continues to count upwards, and if it reaches 5200F, it's game over. Each rescued reactor will reduce the temperature.

The ship has inertia, and takes time and energy to slow down. The spaceship needs to be navigated through a number of tight caverns while combating enemy creatures. The player has limited firepower, men, and shields, but more can be picked up as the caverns are navigated. Caverns consist of a number of interconnecting scrolling caverns of varying design. Dispersed throughout are docking stations, which allows the player to equip acquired items to their ship. The goal is to navigate the entirety of the caverns before time runs out.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Alien kritters are attacking your planet, and only a small number of command ships are available to defend your star-base. Most of the aliens are in stasis. Left to themselves, they will slowly but randomly materialize from one of the eight transportation beams that terminate just above the planet's surface. Once they arrive, these spacecraft will make a kamikaze dive at your command ship. The alien kritters from these transport beams are impervious to your normal weapons, and must be avoided. Instead of waiting for the ships to arrive, you can activate them at a more convenient time by firing on them. Kritters from higher up in each beam are able to maneuver more quickly, and are much more likely to crash into you.</p>\n<p>In addition to the menace from the transporter beams, there are free falling kritters. These slowly fall straight down from the top of the screen, and may be shot. They will destroy you if they run into you, and if they slip past your defences will cause you to lose points from your score. Both free falling and transported kritters are worth more points if shot higher up the screen.</p>\n<p>You start the game with three command ships. Up to five extra command ships may be awarded by killing alien patrol kritters which occasionally move from right to left across the very top of the screen. Removing all aliens from the screen takes you to the next skill level (which ranges from zero to nine). Each level increases the number and speed of the free falling kritters but also provides you with an extra super-missile. Activating super-missiles allow you to destroy one of the normally invulnerable aliens from the transport beams.</p>",

The nearby countryside is displayed on an 18 x 9 grid, which includes woods, dry brush, lakes, your fire tower, a fuel depot, the governor's mansion, and a supply base. Each turn, the player is able to drop fire retardant, set up a ground crew, and dig a fire break. The goal is to minimize property damage to the surrounding countryside. The player takes a significant financial hit if the governor's mansion burns down, and if the fuel depot catches on fire all nearby areas ignite. If the supply base burns, then resources to fight the fire become more scarce. Wind conditions will affect the direction of spread and the speed of the fire.</p>\n<p>The player can select stable, unstable, or very unstable wind patterns, and can also start a game with a fire caused by a mild, moderate, or severe thunderstorm.

        "description": "<p><em>Phobos</em> is a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/29482/caverns-of-mars/\">Caverns of Mars</a>, and has similar game-play. In the previous game, you had defeated the Martians on their home planet, but a group of renegades has escaped, and set up headquarters on the moon Phobos. Your new task is to descend into a heavily defended cavern on this tiny moon, and neutralize the control center at the bottom.</p>\n<p>The cavern that you are infiltrating is marked by a number of stages, given in alphabetical order by the letters A to P. The game can be played at four difficulty levels, corresponding to the depth of the cavern. The Novice player is only required to reach stage F, while the Commander needs to complete all of the stages down to P. Each of the stages has a themed obstacle such as flashing barriers, moving walls or bricked up areas that must be shot through.</p>\n<p>You control a space-ship, which may move around the screen in any direction. For the first four stages of each level, you are pulled by gravity towards the centre of Phobos and have limited vertical mobility. However this effect disappears as you get closer towards the centre. You also have the ability to shoot downward to destroy enemy infrastructure. But don't be too close to the TNT if you shoot it, or it will explode taking you with it and losing one of your lives.</p>\n<p>In addition to dodging lethal obstacles, you are also in constant danger of running out of fuel. Fuel may be replenished by destroying certain bases that appear regularly throughout the cavern. Once you have reached the bottom of the cavern, the control centre, which is defended by a concrete bunker, must be destroyed. This ends the level, and your mission restarts at a higher level. Higher levels seem identical to earlier ones, except you are awarded with an extra flag which appears at the bottom right of the screen. Finishing eight of these levels ends the game.</p>",

Somewhere within the ancient maze-like Temple of Kavinu lies the Chalice. </p>\n<p>The player's party consists of the heir to the Corpas throne Prince Jaun VII, wielder of the Silver Sword Sir Denish, the martial artist Squire Cott, the holder of the Teleporting Ring Scholar Dell, the beautiful female archer Gala the Huntress, the great escape artist Dike the Thief, and the fireball casting Wizard Zigg. All characters must move as a group, and each one of these have individual offense and defensive strength.</p>\n<p>Each character has a special skill, and if that character is lost, the skill is lost as well to the party. For instance the huntress can fire arrows, the thief can safely open chests, and the scholar can use special items. </p>\n<p>As the player explores the dungeon, they must avoid deathtraps, and engage in combat with Creepers. The goal is to gather four different colored gemstones from the chests within the dungeon, and locate the treasure room, which contains the Chalice. The player must then return successfully to the entry staircase.</p>",

        "description": "<p>You have just discovered friendly droids on Quarxon, in a galaxy far away, when you have suddenly come under attack by other less friendly droids who want to take over the universe. Your task is to defend the friendly droids, currently protected by layers of bunker, from the attackers. </p>\n<p>You control a single ship which can move horizontally, and to a limited extent vertically. You can only shoot vertically. Quarxon's atmosphere has several characteristics important for your battle. First, there is a boundary line that is impenetrable to blaster fire. Shooting at this will cause the blast to reflect back to your own position. Naturally occurring holes will frequently appear in this layer, allowing you to shoot the enemy on the other side. Second, shooting twice from the same location will cause a patch to appear, which allows your opponent to shoot through the boundary, even when there are no holes. Thirdly, getting hit by an opponent's shot will activate a crushing atmospheric disturbance which slowly moves inwards, and will destroy you unless you can maneuver between holes in the layer.</p>\n<p>There are a number of configurable options for game-play, such as the difficulty (or speed), the number of starting droids, and the number of layers of bunker defending each side's droids and whether you play against another human or the computer. The game concludes when one side has shot all of the other's droids.</p>",

Each dog can throw dog treats, which if they strike their opponent, will cause them to drop all their collected bones. The dogs cannot stop nor reverse direction, and can only change direction when they encounter an intersection within the maze. The first player to safely return 100 bones to their doghouse is the winner. When two characters become separated within the maze, the game switches to a split screen mode.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Can't Quit</em> is a 1 - 2 player gambling game for the 8-bit Atari computer.</p>\n<p>The goal of this game is to move your playing piece from the left to the right on 3 or 4 rows of the game board. The game board is designed in a hexagon with rows numbered 2 to 12. Rows 2 and 12 have 5 spaces, rows 3 and 11 have 7 spaces, all the way to row 7 which has 15 spaces. The player rolls 4 dice, and the player can choose whichever 2 rows contains a sum of 2 of the dice rolled. Depending on the rows chosen, the playing pieces will march one space to the right, or 2 spaces if a double is chosen. On the first rolls, the player chooses the 3 or 4 rows that will be their goal to move a piece all the way to the right. The player can choose to quit after any roll, and forfeit the next turns to their opponent. If the player rolls a dice combination that does not allow them to progress on their chosen rows, then that player loses all progress during their recent turns. The goal is to take a number of spaces, but not to be too greedy and lose all progress. The first player to march across their 3 or 4 chosen rows is the victor.</p>",

Only you, the space physician, can prevent a deadly epidemic. Infectious single-celled organisms have propagated in chambers beneath the planet Zorp. Equipped with a nimble probe vehicle, you can fire hypervaccine into the chambers to eradicate the creatures. Unfortunately, the organisms sense your presence when you enter their chamber, and rapidly begin to multiply and mutate into aggressive predators. Can you save the planet from peril?</p>\n<p>The player moves a small vehicle, which can move in all directions, and shoots two streams of bullets forwards. The player moves between chambers, and has 99 time units to eradicate the dangers in each chamber. At the beginning of each stage, a number of alien eggs appear, which begin to hatch if the player can't shoot them in time. These creatures begin to assault the player. \nThere are three levels of difficulty: intern, doctor, and surgeon. The player starts with 3 probes, and when all are lost, it's game over.</p>",

Unless you can deliver the moonshine, they can't open tonight, and they don't like to be disappointed. The player must thread their way through city streets in their delivery wagon trying to gather different types of booze. While doing this, the player must avoid the Prohibition agent who cruises the streets. He's faster than you, and can set up roadblocks, and will give chase if you approach too close. You can thwart his pursuit by throwing out traps and monetary bribes to slow him down temporarily. After picking up 10 drinks, the player can exit the level to the right, and enter the next city district. Intermittently, an electrical storm passes overhead and disorients the Prohibition agent. The player has limited gas, and must complete the maze quickly, picking up fuel pumps. The player starts with 5 lives, and when all are lost, it's game over. There is a total of 20 different levels.</p>",

After landing in the Orient, you hail a rickshaw to take you into town. The driver offers some light refreshment during the short journey. Gratefully you gulp down the golden liquid, and that's the last thing you remember before you wake up in a dimly lit, paneled room. It turns out the rickshaw driver was hired by the runner-up, who is sore at losing, and wants a little revenge. </p>\n<p>The player must navigate a series of colored rooms and mazes to try to escape this trap and reach freedom.

Two dogs appear on the screen, each controlled by a different player. Fire hydrants appear on the screen, and the first player to reach the hydrant makes it that color. Immediately a new hydrant then appears on the screen. If a target is not tagged fast enough, a car will drive across the screen, and if it hits a dog, it's game over. On the top of the screen is a counter, and for every successfully tagged hydrant, it moves towards that player. The first person to take control of the counter is the winner. If the player runs into a hydrant previously tagged by an opponent, they also lose a point, until the screen is almost filled by tagged hydrants. Each player can throw a bone, and if it hits an untagged hydrant, the player gains the point. If the bone misses, it needs to be collected before it can be thrown again.</p>",

All commands are via menu structures, and each turn is timed, giving players a time limit to enter commands. Gameplay occurs in three phases. In the event phase, either a recession occurs and player resources are limited, or a nuclear conflict occurs. If nuclear conflict occurs, the player can declare war against an opponent.</p>\n<p>The second phase is the asset phase, where the player can buy or sell factories, energy and gold. They can also divert resources to their army. Finally, in the domination phase, the player can choose to utilize diplomacy to try to gain power with a rival country, or can declare war to forcibly take their resources. When declaring war, the player allocates divisions to attack, and each division allocated provided 1 second of attack time, where the player enters an arcade sequence to shoot at enemy installations with a large cannon. If attacking successfully, the player gains resources from this nation yearly. </p>\n<p>The winner is the nation that has amassed the most resources by endgame.</p>",

If the player plays so that the last space becomes a 2 or a 3 on their opponent's side of the board, they gain those point. The points are removed from the board, and gameplay continues until all points are removed from the board. There are 7 levels of computer opponent difficulty, and the player can start with 4 - 8 points in each space on the circle. The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.</p>",

The planet was completely destroyed, but for a small band of Mathmen who escaped aboard the giant robot ship Metrica. While searching for a new home, the Mathmen landed within a crater of the moon Equatus. As they were exploring, an Equacion battlecruiser attacked, roaring across the mouth of the cavern expelling a mathematical problem, and unleashing a lethal number line that plummeted towards the Mathmen.</p>\n<p>The player controls a Solutus fighter ship tasked with defending the stranded Mathmen as they await rescue. As the numbers streak towards the player, the spaceship must be maneuvered horizontally to shoot the correct digits before they reach the Mathmen to answer the question displayed at the top of the screen. Every incorrect answer causes Mathmen to perish, and after three incorrect answers, it's game over. There are 4 levels of difficulty, allowing for more difficult questions, and the numbers descend faster.</p>",

Each skimmer is armed with a bumper, which will temporarily enact a forcefield around their vessel. If the player hits an unshielded vessel, they'll destroy it. After the shield expires, that vessel is temporarily defenseless until the shield can recharge. If 2 unshielded vessels collide, both are destroyed. Each player starts with the same number of vessels, and the last player standing is the victor. Players can set a timed game, and can give different players a handicap, allowing their shields to last longer. There are 17 different game boards to choose from.</p>",

The vehicle will always travel horizontally within lanes, but can be steered left and right. There are 4 fuel pumps, and the player must navigate a vehicle to each of these. After doing this, the game becomes more difficult with thicker traffic. The vehicle has 2 speeds. The player starts with 3 cars, and it's game over if all are lost by hitting another vehicle. There's limited fuel to compete each level.</p>",

To determine their location, the player fires vorpal beams from any of the locations around the outside of the grid. A vorpal beam travels in a straight line unless it comes near a snark. A vorpal beam that runs directly into a snark is absorbed. A vorpal beam that is fired next to a snark is redirected 90 degrees away from the snark. This information is marked on the screen as the player discovers it, and the goal is to solve the snark locations in as few of screens possible. After marking all snark locations, the player can ask the computer to confirm snark location. </p>\n<p>Either a computer or a player can hide the snarks. A time limit can be set from 25 to 975 ticks, which affects the final score.</p>",

Your goal is to escape from there and return to the normal world alive. The wizard has placed many traps and a few hints in your way to make things challenging for you. The player has limited health, and starts at 50%. Smaller injuries deplete health leading to death, while major injuries lead to instant death. There is a basic combat system for monsters found throughout the land. There are numerous dead ends and ways to die, including: poisonous snakes, rock slides, spike traps, cave bats, and consuming too much water. The player must explore caverns and forests to escape to freedom. </p>\n<p>All commands are via VERB NOUN entry. The player can ask for help at any time to get advice on specific areas. There is no save or restore feature.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Star Island is an Atari 8-bit version of the Cinematronics arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Star+Castle\">Star Castle</a>. An enemy is hiding out behind three layers of shielding, with additional protection by homing missiles and a cannon. Your task is to pilot your ship to avoid the obstacles, take out the shields and destroy your foe.</p>\n<p>The ship that you pilot moves about the screen by controlling the orientation and thrust, and has some inertia so it continues to move after stopping thrust. You can pass through the edges of the screen, which wrap to the other side. You can also collide with the island's shield without damage, but it brings you to a complete stop. Colliding with one of the protective missiles, or a shot from the cannon will lose one of your lives.</p>\n<p>The three layers of shields are slowly rotating about your opponent. Shooting them will remove a section, which allows the next shot to pass unaffected. Removing all of the sections of a shield will trigger a new layer to be constructed. A single shot, passing through holes in all three layers of shields is enough to destroy your opponent. And then the next one appears, with slightly faster missiles and more effective cannons.</p>",

His arch enemy Brian the Blob found out where Dan kept the diamond and stole it from him. Brian took the diamond to his deepest vault and locked it away there. </p>\n<p>The player controls Dan, as he travels steadily deeper into a series of caverns. On each level, Dan must trample the mushrooms and collect the small diamonds to open the passageway to the next deeper level of the vault. The player must avoid the creatures that roam the underground caverns, and all the while Brian the Blob slowly chases after the player. The player can move horizontally and downwards, they can also move vertically while in tight vertical shafts. If the player strikes an enemy, they lose a life. Three lives lost, and it's game over.</p>",

They have effected their escape by hijacking a green army truck and are desperately trying to navigate their way home. You have been scrambled in your helicopter to aid their escape by eliminating the fleet of cars in pursuit. </p>\n<p>The player controls a helicopter that moves in all directions, and can drop bombs. The player must destroy any cars that appear before they can leave the bridge. A car when hit often immediately reverses direction. If a car escapes, hostile forces are alerted, and the player will be shot down by a missile. If the player shots the green army truck, they are also destroyed. There are 3 levels of difficulty. Level 1 has navy missiles. Level 2 adds anti-aircraft rockets, and level 3 further adds zig-zagging UFOs. The level progresses after destroying 75 cars. The player starts with 9 lives, and it's game over when all are lost.</p>",

On the top of the screen are a number of balloons that the player attempts to pop by bouncing their characters into them. If the character falls to the floor without the see saw properly positioned beneath them, a life is lost. The player starts with 5 lives, and it's game over when all are lost.

The halls are infested with vampires, werewolves and monsters, and your aim is to survive the beasties and accumulate as much gold as possible in this text based dungeon crawler.</p>\n<p>The game begins in a shop in Room 1 of the castle, which sells various items. Food is important, as without this your health will drain quickly. Armour will protect your health against supernatural violence, but will slowly wear away with each attack. Then there are three types of weapon: silver bullets which can only be used to kill werewolves, wooden stakes for vampires and a sword for miscellaneous monsters. Like the armour, the sword will eventually wear out and needs to be periodically renewed.</p>\n<p>Two special items are also available for sale. There is a cross, which will prevent vampires from attacking. There is also a magic ring, which when activated will teleport you to the nearest shop (and may actually create a new shop if an existing one is not handy).</p>\n<p>Most of the game takes place in rooms of the castle. These are screens of text with a room number, a list of all of the compass bearings of the exits from the room, and a list of all of the monsters and gold present within the room. You can choose to attack the monsters, which automatically uses the correct weapons for dispatching the different types of foe. If you fail to kill the monsters, or if you try to leave the room without killing them, then they get a shot at you, and your life counter will decrease if they successfully attack. If you leave a room containing gold after killing all of the enemies in it, you will pick up some percentage of that gold (this percentage may be zero).</p>\n<p>While visiting rooms, other effects may occur. Sometimes a demon will steal some or all of your money unless you kill it first. For this reason, it is a good idea to leave most of your money in the bank at the shop. Also, Igor will sometimes appear and steal your holy cross, making you more vulnerable to vampires. A map of all of the visited rooms is available, but it only shows the direction of your last exit from that room instead of showing all available exits.</p>",

The goal each level is to evade or destroy the alien robots and spiders to reach the exit on the other side of the screen. The player has limited shield power, which is decreased when shot by enemies, making it game over when the shields are depleted. Some enemies require multiple shots to destroy, and enemies can become partially disabled. When spiders are shot, they become aggravated, and begin to fire wildly in all directions.</p>",

Your goal is to make it past all of the dangers that are thrown at you across five Sectors, and destroy the enemy base.</p>\n<p>Mars Mission II is a sequel to the vertical scrolling shoot-em-up <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/29482/caverns-of-mars/\">Caverns of Mars</a>. However, in this game the screen scrolls horizontally with gameplay more closely resembling that of the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Scramble\">Scramble</a>. You control a spacecraft with a forward firing gun, which may be used to destroy the various missiles and mines that get in your way. You can also shoot fuel depots, which will replenish your fuel, which would otherwise drain at a constant rate. Running out of fuel will cause the loss of a life. You may also lose a life if you collide with an enemy or with the terrain.</p>\n<p>There are five different sectors in any given game: the country-side, the minefields of Chron, the Suburbs of Canalus (fuel is scarce here), downtown Canalus and the underground maze. At the end of the fifth sector, a hexagonal base will appear, which must be shot to complete the level. Once this is done, the game loops back to the beginning but at a higher difficulty.</p>",

They also choose their primary goals in life, including: money, knowledge and intellectual curiosity, and health and happiness. The personality traits determine how often a player gets positive or negative outcomes to their roles, as well as the associated modifiers to success or failure. One game play begins, each turn a player can choose to roll a dice, move the player, flip a card, or end the turn. The computer does not track whether a specific move is valid or invalid. The player moves around the board the appropriate number of squares each turn, and flips the card their playing piece lands upon. </p>\n<p>Flipped cards include: chance, gamble, knowledge, money, health and happiness, intellectual curiosity, and romance. These options include trivia questions, short arcade sequence, or other activities which will increase or decrease a players' 3 goals. </p>\n<p>The game ends after a randomized number of turns, and the player who scores the highest towards his desired life goals is the winner.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Astron IV</em> is a turn based top down maze game. You play a space warrior tasked with cleaning out the pirate asteroid Astron IV by visiting four levels of the complex, destroying all of the power panels, and then escaping. </p>\n<p>Each level is a randomly generated 5x5 maze of rooms connected by corridors and one-way elevators between floors. You start on the first level with three vehicles which can transport you through the corridors of the maze. However each step brings you closer to death. You start with a power of 100, and every eight moves of your ship this power is decreased by 1 until you reach zero power and you die. When this happens, you return to control the next ship from the starting position on level 1, or if you run out of ships the game ends.</p>\n<p>Throughout the maze, there are robot guards. Every eight of your moves, the robots will get a chance to move also. They can move further than you, but are not very smart. On their turn, robots will directly rush at you until their movement is stopped, and then will deflect in a random direction. If you are hit by the direct rush, you will lose power corresponding to the strength of the robot. During your turn, you can fire Z-bolts at the robots, either horizontally vertically or diagonally. These will reduce the strength of the robot until it reaches zero, at which point it is destroyed. Firing these bolts will also reduce your power.</p>\n<p>There are ways to revive your power, but these are relatively scarce. On level 1, small energy orbs revive you by 5 units, and energy transmitters by about 30 units. These increase in effectiveness on higher levels, but so do the robots and their attacks. One-way elevators can be found to take you between floors.</p>\n<p>Other objects are found throughout the complex. There are some checkered rectangular objects, which give you points for collecting. There are also power panels, which may be shot and destroyed. Once all of the panels within the maze have been disintegrated, a count-down starts and you need to reach your original position on Level 1 to escape from the complex and win the game.</p>",

A robot is placed deep inside a maze and relays visual information to a computer in front of the athlete. With the aid of a 3-D view on the screen in front of him or her, the athlete must guide the robot through the maze as fast as possible. The event is called Captivity.</p>\n<p>The player attempts, from a 1st person perspective, to escape a randomly generated 26 x 15 maze. There are 20 methods of maze generation. The player can move forwards, backwards, left, and right.</p>",

A shielded enemy space station sits in the center of the screen, with a small core inside. An enemy spaceship moves laterally on the bottom of the screen, and if the player shoots it, the enemy ship moves into the larger base, and the shields drop. The player can then shoot the core for bonus points. The player has limited fuel. Fuel items drop from the top of the screen, and if the player shoots them, their fuel stores are increased. The player starts with 3 ships, and it's game over when all are lost. There are 3 levels of difficulty.</p>",

The beings, called the Ologians, hailed from Epsilon-Cygnus-4. They brought news from their planet, that to make war bloodless, all battles would be fought by machines, and limited to \"means of production\". Unfortunately, these machines, tired of being destroyed in the Ologian battles, revolted and called themselves the Tartillians. Not satisfied with just destroying the Ologians, the Tartillians have set their sights on the Earth. In 2072, the first Tartillian interplanetary bomb was detonated above the Earth's surface. Fortunately, the Earth has spent the last 16 years preparing for the counterattack, and the first squadron of Earth's attack force is now approaching EP-CYG-4.</p>\n<p>The player controls a Gravitron Drive attack ship to attack the surface of EP-CYG-4. The ship can be moved in all directions, and the direction of its firing can be rotated 360 degrees. The player travels through a number of screens of alien terrain, and tries to destroy all of the alien installations</p>",

The cobra moves horizontally on a series of platforms, and can drag energy conduits horizontally. The goal is to connect all of the conduits, so that they bring energy to the surface, activating the electrical field, and zapping the moth that flies across the top of the screen. To defend itself, the cobra can shoot electric bolts, which damage some creatures, but can also jump out of the way to avoid other monsters as they pass. The large moth at the top of the screen drops battery beetles, which will disconnect conduits by hauling them off to the side of the screen. The cobra can move up or down to any level that has been connected to conduits, but to travel higher, or to go lower if the beetles remove conduits, must use the elevators at the sides of the screen. The player starts with 3 lives, and it's game over if all are lost. The player loses a life if they are hit by an enemy or if the timer runs out.</p>",

During these stages, the player attempts to live life to its fullest potential against a clock of decreasing years. </p>\n<p>The game starts with the Birth, represented by a spiral emerging from the blackness. The player can interact with the spiral's music during this stage, but Birth is otherwise not interactive for the player. </p>\n<p>The spiral then fades, and the player enters a playpen representing Childhood. During this stage, the player tries to move 10 blocks around to capture 4 of the 5 rapidly bouncing character types in the corners of the screen. One of the remaining free character types when time runs out will become the player's character type. The number of captured character types determines the player's lifespan from 67 to 99 years. As the game progresses, and the player takes damage, years of life are lost.</p>\n<p>The player now enters the Adulthood portion of the game, which consists of 3 separate mini-games. The player tries to make four passes through all 3 segments in an effort to collect all five initially glimpsed character types. </p>\n<p>During the first game, the player travels through space, and can accelerate or decelerate. as they travel, they see different character types, with the goal to find one that aligns with the player's type in color and form. Once choosing a type, the player must travel through an opportunity gate, by positioning their pointer in the center of the gate. The closer the selected character type is to their own, the fewer common interest squares required in the next game. </p>\n<p>From here, the player enters Situations &amp; Conversations. This is represented by a grid densely populated by rapidly moving creatures. When three creatures come close together, they form a connecting link. The player must come in contact with common interest squares the same color as the connecting link. The player must enter the center of the conversation after acquiring common interest squares, and must stay there for 3 seconds, and you will be accepted into the group.</p>\n<p>Finally, the player enters the Experience Corridor. Here, the player positions their character within a rapidly moving corridor. During the day, the player must avoid black enemies representing fear and doubt, while collecting the white characters representing hope. At night, all of these harass the player, and they must avoid all enemies. If the player survives the tunnel, the will restart adulthood, and try to gather the next character type until they have gathered all 4.</p>",

Gameplay is divided into 2 parts. In the first, the player searches a human body divided into a grid, attempting to find an area of high infection. The patient's temperate and heart rate are displayed on the screen. After finding the infection, the player enters an arcade sequence where they move a white blood cell around a maze trying to gobble up the bacteria. Different-sized rod-like structures temporarily slow the player down if they come in contact. If too many contact the player the patient's temperature increases. There are 4 levels of difficulty, as determined by the patient's starting temperature .</p>",

The players occupy different sides of the screen separated by a barrier, which is impenetrable to ships but not to their missile weapons. Shooting an opponent will temporarily disable them, and cause this barrier to shift towards their side of the board. The aim is then to stun the opponent sufficiently often that the barrier traps them with no room to move, at which point you win the game.</p>\n<p>There are a few nuances to game-play. For instance, every missile shot causes hyperspikes to break out in the wall immediately behind it. These spikes are deadly to the touch, and can be used to restrict your opponent's movement. Also, while shooting at each other, either side may be occasionally attacked by rammers, space mines, streakers and smart bombs.</p>",

Your skill and cunning are your main tool. You will salvage as much as you can from your starship and begin your trek. With a fair amount of luck, your supplies should last. If you hurry!</p>\n<p>The player has a total of 6 days of food to reach their destination, and each day is divided into 3 turns: morning, evening, and night. Each player starts at a preset location on the overhead map, and they can only move during daylight. The player chooses their starting weapons with a limited weight restriction, with each piece having distinct ammo load. </p>\n<p>Movement occurs on an overhead map, where the player specifies which direction to travel each turn. There are 8 terrain types, which effect movement speed and possible monster encounters. The player has 6 movement turns per round. During movement, the player can encounter dangerous alien lifeforms. These are fought in ranged and then close combat, where the player must select which weapon to use, and how much ammo they have remaining. Each hit will sap a single health point from the player or enemy.</p>",

You must defeat three evil wizards living in three separate castles. If you succeed, you may marry the princess. But if you happen to die in the attempt... oh well.</p>\n<p><em>Castle quest</em> is a top-down stealth game. You must solve a series of 10 rooms in each castle in order to get to the wizards. Each room contains a bunch of walls that are lethal to the touch, some unpredictably moving guardian creatures and two keys. The second key only appears once the first key is collected, and the aim is to get to each of these keys while avoiding the guards. This will open up an exit leading to the next room, which must be reached before a time runs out. Later rooms in the castle generally have more guardians and more complicated layouts. In room 10, collecting both keys will cause a wizard to appear. You must then destroy him and escape from the room to complete the castle.</p>\n<p>The creatures in each room can move so quickly that you may need help in passing some of the rooms. A friendly wizard has given you a magic cloak with the power to slow down time. If you use this power too frequently though, its power will diminish and if it reaches zero will cost you a life. You start the game with three lives, and you receive another three for each castle completed. Losing all of your lives loses the game, but will at least make the king happy.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Chicken</em> is a simple arcade game about poultry in traffic. You control a chicken, who can move only in the vertical direction, and starts at the top of the screen. Cars pass horizontally along the road, and you must move the chicken through multiple lanes of traffic to the other end. The speed of the cars is roughly related to the difficulty level, which depends on your performance. The aim is to earn points by crossing the road as many times as possible within a time limit.</p>\n<p>You start the game with 50 points, 30 time units (about 2 minutes) and the lowest difficulty. Each time you reach the bottom of the screen, you receive 10 points times by the difficulty, the difficulty is increased, and you are returned to the top of the screen. If you are hit by a car, you lose 20 points, the difficulty is decreased, and the game continues after shifting you slightly towards the top of the screen out of the way of the car. Every 300 points, you receive another 40 seconds of play time.</p>",

You have decided to rid the world of these loathsome beasts and have entered the caverns to find three magical items (an amulet, some arrows and a sword) with which to defeat the megawump.</p>\n<p>You start the game in one of the caverns, with possible exits in each of the four sides of the screen. All of the caverns in the game are arranged within a 6x6 square grid. Most of them are populated with two enemies belonging to three possible types: pythons, trolls or hydra. Snakes will tend to leave you alone unless you are close enough, but hydra will follow you constantly. Contact with any enemy will result in the loss of one of your five lives. There are treasures of various sorts scattered around the place. Gold and jewelry provide you with points that add to your score. Other items include smart and dumb arrows, an amulet which gives you immunity to the megawump's lightning attack, a key which can be used to open a magic box, and a sword that can be found inside the magic box.</p>\n<p>One of the caverns contains the megawump. On entering its lair, it will shut off all exits from the room, preventing your escape. To defeat the megawump, you must hit it with three arrows, changing its colour. Then, once it is in this vulnerable state, you can finish it off with the magic sword to win the game. To assist you in avoiding the megawump before you are ready, you can use the fact that hydras occupy the closest caves to its lair (with trolls further out, and then pythons) to guess its location.</p>",

Starting with $1,000 and a debt of $30,000 (which rises at an exorbitant rate of 26% every turn), you need to buy and sell six different cargoes (tea, opium, tobacco, cannons, matches and cotton) in five different ports (Bangkok, Singapore, Madras, Calcutta and Manila). After buying and selling the cargo, you can travel to another port (each trip results in your debt increasing with interest); the prices in various ports fall and rise quite randomly. Your ultimate goal is to pay off the entire debt. </p>\n<p>During travel, there is a chance of a storm which destroys half of your current cargo. </p>\n<p>At any time, you can visit your creditor to repay or borrow some money.</p>",

You control a cursor that can move around the outside of a 2D rectangular reservoir. In the centre is an angry starfish that moves randomly. You can make forays into the middle of the reservoir, leaving a path behind you. Once you return to the perimeter, the area formed by your path that does not contain the starfish gets filled with water. The path then becomes part of the reservoir wall. If the starfish touches you, or the path as you are making it, you will lose a life. Otherwise, once you have filled in a sufficient percentage of the reservoir, you move on to the next arena where the starfish is angrier, and you need to fill in a greater percentage of the total area.</p>",

The player starts with 6000 Centurions, and must purchase swords, shields, horses, and sandals to supply their forces for marching and attacking. Each turn, the player can advance, where they encounter a foreign colony with a strength of 1 - 9. These colonies can be attacked, or the player can choose to leave. If the player attacks successfully, they gain citizens, slaves, and the city. If the player loses, they lose Centurions. Citizens can be drafted as new Centurions, and slaves can be sold. Each time the player advances, they must pay their troops 1 Sesterces per Centurion. It's game over if the player runs out of money.</p>",

The first player whose vehicle collides with the vehicles' trails, or with the borders of the arena, loses the round. When one of the players loses 9 rounds, the game is over, and the remaining player is declared the winner. </p>\n<p>The game also keeps track of the players' score. Points are continually received for staying alive during a round (at the same rate by both players, making it purely cosmetic), and a player receives 100 bonus points when the opponent loses a life.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Midway Battles</em> is a strategy wargame for the 8-bit Atari.</p>\n<p>It is June 4th, 1942. You stand on the bridge of the carrier Enterprise observing your attack planes warming up on the deck, exhaust flames belching in the dawn light of this fateful day. The search planes have been out since early morning, looking for the fleet that was sighted by Midway planes yesterday. You feel terribly outclassed, seeking to engage the undefeated Imperial Japanese navy with your meager forces. </p>\n<p>The player can participate with human or computer opponent. The Historical Midway Scenario, No Coral Sea Operation, and Random Encounter Scenario are available. The player can choose to add carriers, battleships, or both to either the American or Japanese forces. The player assigns their ships to a number of task forces. Each turn the player and Japanese forces move their ships on an overview screen, and can review the condition of their forces. The player can send out searches from Midway or their task forces, and can attack or send out a combat air patrol if enemy ships are detected.</p>",

To escape, you must pass through a series of chambers of increasing complexity (up to some maximum difficulty that is selected at the start of the game). In each chamber, you must destroy the sentry to open a door and escape through it. But if you are too slow to flee the level, the sentry is replaced, the door is closed, and you must try again.</p>\n<p>The major difficulty in the game is in controlling your ship, which has a great deal of inertia. Accidentally colliding with a wall will cause you to bounce in the opposite direction, losing control and incurring a time penalty. Occasionally, the sentry will teleport to another part of the room. It will also teleport if you run into it.</p>\n<p>There is no way of dying in the game. Instead, you need to escape from a certain number of chambers to win the game, and your overall score is the total amount of time used.</p>",

If the player is captured by a droid, they are brought back to the starting antechamber. If the player takes too much damage, it's game over.</p>",

Those Fuzzies may look cute and cuddly but they're mean little critters once they're loose and \nsomebody, one of us, has to get them back in their cages. Now who do you think's got the job? Yeah, that's right Crumble, YOU!!</p>\n<p>The player explores 5 separate mazes from a side perspective, each of which contains 6 hiding fuzzies. The player has a jetpack, and can move left, right, up, and down. If the player touches any wall or enemy they lose health from Crumble's Transversal suit, but this can be regained by picking up food. If the player spends too much time in any screen, time lighting will start to drain the suit. If the suit reaches 0, it's game over.</p>",

You can move both ways towards the sides of the river, but can only move forwards along it. The speed with which you move forwards can be toggled between race and cruise modes.</p>\n<p>While making your way up the river, your path will be obstructed by numerous obstacles. There are ducks, swimmers, ramps, row-boats, rocks and piers. Hitting a duck does nothing (to you), but hitting a swimmer will cause you to lose control of the craft for a few seconds, and going over a ramp will launch you into the air where your rudder no longer works. Hitting anything else will cause your boat to explode, and a loss of time when you change to the next boat. You start with three boats, and the game ends when all boats are lost.</p>\n<p>Points are earned for distance travelled along the river. Surplus time at the end of each level is converted into extra points. Later levels become more congested, and require a further distance to be travelled.</p>",

The blood-thirsty (and hungry) aliens are now rounding up the survivors of the planet for use as slaves and food. A dedicated band of scientists have created a self-repairing shielded attack vehicle to defend the Earth. The Wan-Wroth have no sense of honor or fair play, but they do have limits to the resources they can lose in their fight for possession of the Earth. Can you convince them that the Earth is too costly a prize?</p>\n<p>Played from a 1st person perspective, the vehicle can rotate 360 degrees, move forwards and backwards, and fire. The player attempts to destroy all enemy tanks on the level to advance to the next. The player has limited fuel used by movement, and must be replenished at fuel depots. When hit by enemy tanks, the player takes damage, and if receives enough hits is destroyed. The player must also contend with enemy jets and helicopters.</p>",

You control a fighter ship that is tasked with protecting a convoy of cargo ships that are hauling gems mined from the moons of Zeta III. The system is encircled by deadly mine fields, so during the trip out, you will be beset by mines of three types (regular, smart and \"Mirus\"). There are also time beacons, which when hit will alter your apparent velocity through space.</p>\n<p>Your vessel is relatively maneuverable, possesses a rapid fire offensive weapon, and compared to the cargo ships is well armoured. You can sustain five or six hits during a mission, while the cargo transports will be destroyed in one hit. After successfully traversing a mine-field with at least one surviving cargo vessel, you will be given bonus points for extra ships, and a time bonus. Additionally, your shield energy will be replenished, and if you have lost one, you will be given another cargo vessel to defend. The game then continues with mines being encountered more frequently.</p>\n<p>You can lose the game in two ways. Either your ship can sustain sufficient damage that your shields drop below zero energy, or you can arrive at a planet or space station without any cargo ships.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Nineball is a pinball game with nine numbered bumpers. You start the game by shooting the pinball out of a cannon located at the bottom of the screen, which can be rotated before firing. After release, the pinball ricochets around the screen, and the cannon is replaced by a movable paddle. You can move this to prevent the ball from leaving the screen (ala <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Breakout\"> Breakout </a>). Points are scored for your ball hitting the various bumpers. After all nine bumpers have been hit, a bonus obstacle appears which grants you extra points when hit.</p>\n<p>There is only one level layout, but there are four game modes. Mode one plays like standard pinball. With mode 2, you lose a ball if you touch one of the bumpers you have not already hit during the game. Mode 3 adds a black hole that alternates from one side of the board to the other and will swallow your ball on collision. Mode 4 combines modes 2 and 3.</p>",

Rows of targets scroll past, and you have to shoot them, and amass the highest possible score. You will lose a life if you are shot by a target, or if you run out of bullets. Losing all three lives ends the game.</p>\n<p>The scoring system is a little complicated. Objects further away are worth more than closer objects. Red targets are worth less than yellow or green. And the different objects also require a different number of shots to take down, with targets in the second row taking 3 shots per hit. Targets in the final row will replenish your bullet supply by 1 to 4 shots depending on its colour.</p>",

To do this, he must travel across town past houses, a missile base, a graveyard, and finally to school.  Harry can move laterally and jump.  On each screen, the player must collect a number of items that briefly appear as windows open and close.  These can typically only be reached by jumping on top of moving vehicles, and then jumping for the item.  Harry has limited time on each screen to collect enough items to move on to the next screen to the right, and he must avoid dangers including: cars, zombies, birds, arrows, balloons, missiles, troops, and more.  Harry starts with 5 lives, and it's game over when all are lost.</p>",

The player receives 100 points each time they cross the screen, but if they hit an object they are repositioned back to the left.  The goal is to maximize score over 3 minutes of play.</p>",

Suddenly, without warning, strange and devilish forces attack.  The player must guide their sub to shoot torpedoes at incoming enemies.  The player starts at Atlantis, and all movement of their ship costs fuel.  The ship can only shoot horizontally, but enemies come from above.  The player can refuel by returning to Atlantis.  Each level, the player must destroy a certain number of enemies to advance to the next.  If 5 enemies reach Atlantis the city is destroy and it's game over.  If the player's ship is destroyed or runs out of fuel 3 times, the game also ends.</p>",

The player must try to move all the men from the east side of the screen to the west before time runs out.  Some prisoners will escape and move back to the right.

You play as a logic probe that is attempting to find and eliminate electronic faults in your computer. There are six types of faults: arcs, surges, transients, voltage spikes, resistances and shorts.</p>\n<p>The game takes place on the surface of wires of various shapes, that extend into the screen. You can move about the circumference of the wire, avoiding enemies that climb towards you up the circuit lines, and getting into position to return fire with electron bursts. Each of the different fault types have their own type of behaviour. Arcs can travel between circuit lines while surges can move only up and down. Transients turn invisible for periods of time, while voltage spikes become shorts once they reach your side of the circuit. Resistances and shorts can only be destroyed using a \"zap\", which can only be activated once per level, and rids the entire screen of faults. Once all of the enemies have been defeated, you move onto the next level with a different wire shape. There are 64 levels in all, with the first eight shapes corresponding to letters from the title \"LIVEWIRE\".</p>",

        "description": "<p><i>The Lone Raider</i> is an arcade platform game consisting of three stages, where you must raid an enemy base to destroy its transmitter.</p>\n<p>In the first stage, you must shoot robots that appear from the sides of the screen with your sonic laser, and duck as they shoot at you. Once enough of the enemy are destroyed, an indestructable terminator appears and you need to escape inside the enemy base before you are crushed.</p>\n<p>The second stage involves collecting dots, in the neutron storeroom, which is a building with eight floors. Mutant guards patrol the area, and the floors are connected by zap doors which are periodically activate, sucking you through whether you want to go or not. Each floor has a patrolling blue proton. Capturing this will charge you up for a limited period of time and allow you to destroy mutants on contact while it is active. The goal of this level is to first capture all of the neutrons, and then make your way to the bottom of the screen and exit through a newly created zap door.</p>\n<p>Stage three is a simpler three-floor maze, but with fast and deadly defensites that move about in eccentric patterns. Once you have made it to the transmitter at the bottom right of the maze, your job is done and you are beamed back into your spaceship, ready to start again at a higher level of difficulty.</p>",

        "description": "<p><i>Pharaoh's Pyramid</i> is a variant of the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Gottlieb's+Q*Bert\"> Q*Bert </a>. You play as little Achmed, who is forced by the Pharaoh Ramses to build his pyramid. Complete all six levels and you win treasure and the gratitude of the goddess Isis. But the jealous god Osiris will try and stop you by any means.</p>\n<p>The game is played on an isometric pyramid of blocks. You can move diagonally between blocks, but jumping off the edge of the pyramid will cause you to plummet to your doom. Each time you visit a block, it changes colour. In every round, your first goal is to collect contruction material from the river at the bottom of the screen and return it to the top, to add a layer to a new pyramid. After this, you have to change all of the blocks to some specified colour.</p>\n<p>There are many foes that hinder your task. On most rounds, Moses' Snake will slowly follow you around. Different rounds beset you with additional biblical plagues such as frogs, locusts, etc. These enemies appear near the top of the pyramid and meander their way downwards, before disappearing at the bottom. In the final round, you must deal with Osiris himself. Contact with any foe means death. Isis will occasionally appear at one of the bottom corners of the screen, granting you magic that will temprarily remove all foes from the pyramid.</p>\n<p>After you have completed eight rounds, you start the next level which adds extra difficulties. The first level is \"Slave\". The second is \"Builder\", which adds another possible square colour and a crocodile that patrols the river near the building material. The third \"Architect\" level introduces the god Set, who will come by and knock you off the normally safe top block of the pyramid. By the final \"Pharaoh\" level, enemies are moving much faster, and can make holes through the pyramid which will trap the unwary. Both starting level and the game speed are selectable at the start of the game.</p>",

The player controls a hoverbike and is tasked with exploring a labyrinthine underground cavern and finding the exit. The cavern is full of gun emplacements, tanks, and some flying enemies, all of which can be taken out with the bike's laser cannon. In addition, there are rocket launchers that cannot be destroyed; only their projectiles can. The bike's energy levels continually decrease, with depletion meaning game over, but the energy can be refilled at recharging stations. The cave consists of distinct sections that are separately loaded. If the player should lose a life, they can continue at the current section.</p>",

        "description": "<p><i>Silicon</i> is a top-down arcade maze game in the style of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Rally+X\"> Rally X </a> but set on the inside of a silicon chip. You control a miniature debugger, which must traverse the maze to collect all of the stray bits while avoiding dangerous enemies.</p>\n<p>There are two types of enemy in the maze. Bugs, visible on the radar, are constantly on patrol. You can shoot these to return them to egg form where they are immobile but still deadly. Occasionally, a glitch will appear at a random time. When this happens, a \"heartbeat\" is played as a sound cue. The frequency of the heartbeat slowly increases as the glitch becomes more serious, and you will lose a life if it is not destroyed within a certain time.</p>\n<p>The stray bits to be collected appear as shimmering symbols. You can only carry four of these at a time, after which you should take them to the output port at the top right of the maze. Picking up a bonus, appearing as an octagon, will cause your debugger to change colour and become invulnerable for a period of 20 seconds. Getting all stray bits will take you to the next skill level, unless a glitch is active, in which case it must be dispatched first. Later levels have different layouts, and faster and more numerous bugs.</p>",
