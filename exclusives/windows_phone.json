The game operates largely on a touchscreen flicking gesture, flinging gnomes either at jewels (which are carried away to win most levels) or the enemies - square-bodied crows. The game has something of a real-time strategy sense to it, in the command of troops and usage of specialized troop types as the game progresses. It also shows some similarities to Pikmin in its mechanics and troop movements. In various levels, game goals range from collecting jewels to deathmatch-style fights to capture-the-flag encounters.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Bejeweled Live</em> is a version of the <em>Bejeweled</em> series for Windows Phone. It is largely identical to the early game in the series <em>Bejeweled</em> as it does not contain any of the new game modes or gameplay mechanics from the contemporary versions for other platforms. It is played on an 8x8 field where colored jewels need to be lined up horizontally or vertically by swapping them, with at least three of a kind. After the match the jewels code and the board is replenished from the top with new jewels.</p>\n<p>The three game modes are Classic, Race the Clock and Endless Play. Classic is a series of levels presented as an endless mode, Race the Clock introduces a time system, and Endless Play is like Classic, but without the division into levels. A hint button provides suggestions when stuck. The 'Live' part of the title refers to the integration with Xbox Live for leaderboards.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Bejeweled Live+</em> is the second game in the <em>Bejeweled</em> series for Windows Phone, following the earlier <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Bejeweled+Live\">Bejeweled Live</a>. Unlike the first game that borrowed from the early <em>Bejeweled</em> titles, this version is based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Bejeweled+3\">Bejeweled 3</a>.</p>\n<p>The player is presented with a board filled with gems of different colours. The aim of the game is to remove gems from the board by swapping adjacent gems so that a chain of three or more gems is created. New gems will then be generated at the top of the screen and fall down in the empty spaces. This can lead to a chain reaction when gems fall down and create new matches. It is possible to continue swapping gems during a chain reaction. There are some special gems. Flame gems are created from a match of four gems and explode when matched, thereby removing surrounding gems. A match of five gems will create a hypercube which can be matched with any adjacent gem and then destroy all gems of that colour. Star gems are created by T- or L-shaped matches and destroy all gems that are right, left, up and down of the it.</p>\n<p>The game modes included in this version are Butterflies, Classic, Diamond Mine, Lightning and Zen. It does not include Ice Storm, Poker or Quest. Also missing is the Blitz game mode that was made available as a separate game called <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Bejeweled+Blitz\">Bejeweled Blitz</a> for several platforms. The game includes achievements and leadersboards tied to the Xbox Live service and progress in the game modes adds up to a global player level.</p>\n<p>Classic is a series of levels presented as an endless mode. There is no timer or special objectives. Players make matches until no more moves are possible. Diamond Mine is played against the clock and matches need to be made to destroy dirt at the bottom. All dirt needs to be removed before time runs out. By digging through the dirt gold and treasures can be unearthed for extra points. Butterflies introduces a spider near the top of the screen that eats butterflies. The goal of this mode is to keep butterfly gems away from the spider by creating matches. Lightning is a timed mode reminiscent of <em>Bejeweled Blitz</em> where 60 seconds are provided to create as many matches as possible. By matching time gems additional seconds can be won. Zen is like the endless Classic mode, but without the division into levels. That mode also include options to change the background music to nature sounds, textual mantras can be selected to pop up and a breathing modulation display can be enabled. The latter shows a line on-screen, raising and dropping slowly, to help regulate a peaceful way of breathing.</p>",

By tapping, the player can reverse this: now the cat moves upwards. The player needs to avoid the sparkling stars which form upwards/downwards boundaries as well as obstacles in the way. Each survived second the point counter fills up; the goal is to earn as many points as possible. This is not only required to gather a place on the high-score list, but also unlocks additional kittens for the level.</p>\n<p>Each level also has a large amount of animations in the fore- and background, e.g. pictures, ships, other flying animals or flashing colours. Those are designed to distract the player from the real dangers. The levels itself are randomly generated and the gameplay challenges are identical between levels. They have still significant differences because every one features different themes, cat characters and techno tunes.</p>\n<p>This version includes the following levels:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cloud Pack</li>\n<li>Dream Pack</li>\n<li>Lava Pack</li>\n<li>Popaganda Pack</li>\n</ul>",

The story is told in a campain witch does also include the tutorial.</p>\n<p>Similar to CCG <em>(Collectible Card Game)</em> games the cards in the players deck represent creatures, items, sorceries etc. which the player uses in the battle. Before a battle the player has to choose the cards he wants to use, since the number of cards in the deck is limited. In addition to the summoned creatures the player is represented itself as a character on the battlefield. The player has to choose one of the four classes (warrior, sorcerer, conqueror or leader). Cards are used by drawing them from the deck and playing them onto the board. Battles take place on a hexagonal grid map. By winning battles the player gets additional cards.</p>\n<p>Each card played does costs an individual amount of energy to play and does include information like strength, health, move, energy cost, specific type of needed energy or attributes. There are five kinds of energy: earth, water, air, fire and general. At the beginning of each turn the player regains some energy. The number of the regained energy is affected by i.e. emplacements or special creatures. Left energy of the previous turn will not be transfered.</p>\n<p>Some type of terrain effectuate the stats of creatures standing on the tile (i.e.armor penalty, reduced movement) and palisades offer some kind of protection.</p>\n<p>The number of damage taken is calculated by the attackers strength and the defenders protection. There isn't any random or luck value that could influence the result. The attacker deals the damage to the defender first. If the defending creature survives the attack it does automatically retaliate. Attacking and retaliating does cost energy. Most creatures can attack only once per turn.</p>\n<p>The cards are classified into six groups:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Creatures:</strong> They are, beside the main character itself, the soldiers on the battlefield.</li>\n<li><strong>Enchantments:</strong>  They are used to modify the status of creatures for several turns (i.e. gaining more attack points, slow down an enemy).</li>\n<li><strong>Sorceries:</strong> They are similar to enchantments, but their effect is singular.</li>\n<li><strong>Emplacements:</strong> They are similar to enchantments, but they do not affect a specific creature but creatures around the emplacement.</li>\n<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> They modify the the attributes or basis values of the main character.</li>\n<li><strong>Allies:</strong> A creature that appear straight at the beginning of the battle, so it doesn't need to be summoned.</li>\n</ul>",

At the beginning of the player's turn they roll six dice, then set aside one or more scoring dice to accumulate points (singular 5s and 1s, 3 or more of the same number, 3 different pairs of matching numbers, and 1 of every number). The player can then choose to roll the remaining dice, or if they more than the minimum amount of points needed (300 by default) they can end their turn and add those accumulated points to their total score. If the player manages to set aside all six dice they can re-roll all of them to add to their accumulated points. If the player rolls the dice and there are no scoring dice, the player's turn ends and they lose the points they accumulated that turn. Once a player's total score has reached the win threshold (10,000 by default), the apposing player has one last turn to accumulate enough points to overtake their opponent.</p>",

A base score is required to progress to the next level and unlocks a bronze medal. Higher scores unlock silver and gold medals. </p>\n<p>Gold coins can be collected by getting the puck in contact with them and can be transferred to <em>Fable III</em> on Xbox 360 and Windows.
