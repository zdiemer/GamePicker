        "description": "<p><em>No Strings Attached</em> is a code-guessing game. The computer thinks of a code of four digits and the player must guess. The computer will give a hint after each guess, consisting of the symbols X, I and -. These symbols denote a digit being correct and in the correct position, the symbol to exist but in a different position or for the symbol not to exist in the code. The hints can be misguiding in that a guess of 5555 can result in XIII, but the I's can refer to the correctly placed 5, so the amount of fives in the code is actually one.</p>",
