        "description": "<p><em>Gobbledegook</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pac-Man\">Pac-Man</a> clone. As always the player controls his gobbler through a maze and has to collect as many spots as possible without being eaten by the gooks that chase him. Eating a powerpack allows the gobbler to go after the gooks for seven seconds. If eaten by a gook the player loses one of his three lives until it's game over. Before starting a game the player can choose how gooks move at the junctions. Logic A means a random choice from all exits except the one entered while logic B means a random choice from all exits. Logic B is meant to be easier.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Zombies &amp; Potholes</em> is a single screen game where the aim is to move around the screen avoiding being touched and killed by zombies while trying to get them to fall down potholes. You are able to move up, down, sideways and diagonally in eight directions and you move one place at a time but pressing S allows you to stay in the same spot for a turn. Once you moved one place, then all the zombies on screen move one place towards you. If you have a pothole between you and the zombie then he will fall into it and once the screen is cleared then you add a point to your win score. Get touched by a zombie and you add a point to your lose score. Two players can play and one player keeps playing before allowing the other player a turn.</p>\n<p>Before the game you can adjust various parameters and they are, Logic (A or B) which allows you to move off the screen and appear on the opposite side or not, Thinking Time (2 - 100) which is how many seconds to move before the zombies do, Packing Density (10 - 100) which is the number of zombies and potholes on screen, and Difficulty Level (10 - 100).</p>",

Your frog has to cross a road full of traffic which is moving left or right across the screen before attempting to cross a river with crocodiles. Once the road has been crossed there is a path to take a short rest bite, but there is a snake that moves along the path to avoid. To cross the river you have to use the moving logs and turtles but the turtles only stay above water for a short time. Once your frog is in a gap at the top of the screen you then attempt to get another frog to the top but cannot move into a gap already occupied. If you hit the traffic, snake, crocodile, fall in the water of move into a occupied gap, then you lose one of three lives.</p>",

Once all six cells are destroyed, you move to the next level where you must blast eight birds that move two at a time down the screen. You are once again on the bottom of the screen and as well as blasting the birds you must avoid meteors and avoid or shoot other objects.

        "description": "<p>The deep space cargo vessel, <em>Cygnus</em> has been attacked by pirates from the planet Retipujeca who have killed all the crew and stolen all the cargo. As the incident was in your sector, you the leader of a Galaxy Patrol squad must board the vessel to investigate what happened on board. As the boarding hatch is damaged, and the only way to enter is with a backpack, you have also decided to go alone and to also prove your worth as a leader. </p>\n<p>Cygnus is an arcade adventure where you must investigate three floors of the vessel, with each floor shown on the whole screen from above. You must move from room to room as quick as possible as there is only a limited supply of oxygen. Objects like keys can be found and used elsewhere on the vessel. Also on board are robots which move around the vessel and will shoot at anyone on board and if you are shot, touch a robot or run out of air, then it is game over.</p>",

The door to leave the place has disappeared so you have no choice but to explore to find another exit but entering the attic you realise you are not alone with the many rooms full of ghosts and poltergeists.</p>\n<p><em>Atic Raid</em> is an top view flick-screen arcade adventure where you must move around the 100 rooms of the attic finding objects to use like keys and transporters to get to the exit. Once you find a way out of the attic you must attempt to navigate a maze to finally find freedom. In each room is a ghost and occasionally poltergeists but boomerangs can also be found to shoot and stun them. Food is also needed to be found to stay alive and if you touch a ghost or poltergeist then you lose one of 20 lives.</p>",

The aliens are in formation and move across the screen left to right and when they reach the side of the screen, they appear on the other side, one place lower. You are armed with missiles to fire upwards and there are four shields to protect you from the bombs dropped by the aliens, but the shields start to disappear when hit from the alien's bombs or your missiles. If you are hit by a bomb or allow the aliens to reach the bottom of the screen then it is game over. There is an option to play a Fast or Slow game.</p>\n<p>The game was re-released by Micro Marketing Ltd with some slight graphical details and no option for a Fast or Slow game.</p>",

The aliens appear one at a time and must be blasted before they land on the bottom of the screen or it is game over.</p>",

Your job is to look after the power source that keeps the mining community running, microwave arrays, which orbit in space. A threat has now arose from the alien race Carians who are seeking to destroy communities and mining stations in the Solar System due to a Sigmagtobin Export Embargo which led to many of their colonies being infected by Chtorophage. You must control a sight and blast as many Carian Combat Scout Crafts as you can, as well as any Mystons floating in space. Using the sights decreases it's power so you must refuel with any microwave arrays, that you find. The screen scrolls in various directions when you move the sight.</p>\n<p><strong>Dual Duel:</strong> A single screen game where you can play against either the computer or another player. You control a creature with a short tail and as you move around the screen constantly, the tail grows, which is the same for your opponent. The aim is to get your opponent to crash into your tail while avoiding hitting theirs and if either player crashes then they lose one of seven lives. You also lose a life if you move back on yourself and if both creatures hit head-on then the outcome is 50-50.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Tetris</em> is a single screen game where the idea is to stop falling pieces from building up and touching the top of the playing area. Each piece that falls one at a time, is made up of four blocks in various shapes, and can be moved left or right, turned left or right, and dropped down faster. Once the piece hits the bottom of the screen then it can't be moved or turned. As more pieces fall and settle on the bottom, you must try to make solid horizontal lines which when made will disappear and the blocks above fall down. Making so many lines moves you up a level and the more levels you play the faster the pieces fall down. You are able to see the next piece that will fall to plan your moves and when the pieces touch the top of the screen it is game over.</p>",

As you eat all the dots, Ghosts move around the maze trying to kill you and if they touch you then you lose one of three lives. In the corners are four power-pills, and if eaten allow you to chase and eat the Ghosts for a short period.</p>\n<p><strong>Blowing up the World:</strong> A cursor moves across the top of the screen from left to right above a map of the World, and when it reaches the edge of the screen, it appears on the left side again. The aim of the game is to keep bombing the world until it is completely removed before a timer reaches zero. You use the keys 1-8 which allows you to vary the distance of the bomb exploding from your cursor.</p>",

Problem is that the screen is full of mines that cannot be seen. You move one place at a time in four directions and as you move you will be told how many mines are next to you. It is game over if you touch a mine and you can adjust the amount of mines on the screen.</p>\n<p><strong>Casse Briques:</strong> A <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9001/breakout/\">Breakout</a> clone that sees you moving a bat at the bottom of the screen, left or right, and you have to hit a ball and remove bricks above. If the ball goes past the bat then you lose one of nine lives but the amount of lives can be adjusted.</p>",
