        "description": "<p><em>Armoured Assault</em> is a tank battle game of the orthodox style which is enjoyed to this day. Two players start out in their home bases, with the simple goal of destroying the opposing tank. Each tank can take three hits before it is destroyed. Chasing each other uses up fuel reserves as well, and when the fuel gauge reaches zero, the tank is destroyed. The number of shots available is also limited. The screen is filled with barriers to hide behind, but each barrier has a hole in it which can be passed through both by shots and tanks.</p>\n<p>Eight modes of play are available:1. Each tank has two reload zones for fuel and one for bullets.\n- The middle of the screen has a first aid zone which repairs the armour of any tank passing over it.\n- None of the special features mentioned above.\n- All the features of modes 1 and 2 combined.\n- Like mode 1, but with four invincible computer-controlled tanks roaming the screen.\n- Mode 2 with computer tanks.\n- Mode 3 with computer tanks.\n- Mode 4 with computer tanks.</p>",

From a door on the right, vicious creatures with sharp teeth enter the maze. The power pills of the original <em>Pac-Man</em> are not present; instead there is a bar on the top of the screen. Eating dots fills up the bar, and when it has reached a certain level, the player may eat the enemy. The maze has a few different items, such as apples and hamburgers. These carry a much higher value than a single dot, allowing the player to greatly increase the power bar at the top. The bar diminishes at all times, forcing the player to eat more in order to stay invincible.</p>\n<p>Two other items exist in the maze: A stop sign and a key, both of which can be picked up and carried around. The enemies can't pass the stop sign, which allows you to seal paths and keep the enemy away. The key must be carried to the locked door on the left side of the screen. As you carry items, your speed is slowed to a crawl. Taking the key to the door lets you pass to the next maze.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Larv is Swedish for larva, and as the name suggests, it's a \"snake\" game. Steer your larva, growing as it is eating dots, without colliding with yourself or the walls. The larva grows for each fifth dot it eats, and once it reaches 100 segments, it starts off in a new labyrinth. Colliding doesn't instantly kill the larva, only giving it a concussion, costing it a brain cell. </p>\n<p>The game can be played by one or two players. In the competitive two player mode, the objective is to make the opposing player collide.</p>\n<p>There are several settings, such as the density of the labyrinth, the growth rate and the screen colours.</p>",

The player controls a spaceship on a mission to destroy alien freighters carrying deadly hydrogen bombs and \"status beam machines\".</p>\n<p>The player starts off with 5 ships (lives). If the player's ship passes directly above or below an alien ship, the alien ship may trap the player in a \"status beam\".  If the player is directly below the alien ship when the status beam is activated, they will be destroyed, but if the player is above, they will be freed after a few moments. The player's ship can move anywhere on the playing field, while the alien ships can only move from left to right. Alien ships can be destroyed by firing an upwards-moving energy blast from the player's ship, but only one energy blast can exist at any one time; if the player fires a new blast, the previous blast will disappear. 80 points are awarded for the destruction of each alien ship. The aim of the game is to survive as long as possible and destroy as many alien ships as possible.</p>",
