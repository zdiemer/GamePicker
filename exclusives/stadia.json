        "description": "<p><em>Get Packed</em> is hectic, physic-based game about moving. Up to four characters move around a house or a building using an unobstructed top-down view as the roofs are open. They can be moved around freely and two separate buttons are used to control the left and the right hand to pick up items. The general idea is to drag an object outside into a moving van, but often the characters end up hitting each other with their objects, knocking each other out, breaking objects or damaging the environment. Other buttons can be use to gain extra speed through dashing or to jump. Another action allows the character to flatpack items, making them smaller. This only last a few moments before it pops open again and there is a fifteen second cooldown before it can be used again.</p>\n<p>The characters' performance is generally rated on the value of the packed goods, shown through a bar near the top of the screen. The big rewards come in when the cargo is successfully delivered by the van. Objects are not always static, as one objective is for instance to catch a cat running inside. New objects to locate often appear in the bottom right corner of the screen and they need to be brought to the van before the timer runs out for a bonus. Damage to goods deducts cash from the earnings. There are different characters to choose from with customization options.</p>\n<p>Primarily marketed as a party game, it supports up to four players in both the Campaign and the Competitive mode both online with matchmaking and with local support for four players on the same device using only one Stadia account. The Campaign mode can be played alone in single-player. The Campaign mode contains twelve levels and the competitive Versus mode three. Campaign levels are unlocked gradually by getting at least a single star rating completing a level. The Campaign always has clear objectives and a cash reward tied to a three-tier star rating, but there is also a separate Destruction mode where the goal is always to cause as much damage as possible.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Worm Game</em> is a variant of the classic game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Snake\">Snake</a>. It was initially developed as an internal prototype to test Stadia features before the public launch of the service in 2019. The game was released publicly in January 2023 and became the final game to be released on the service before Stadia was shut down.</p>\n<p>The classic game mechanics are used. The player controls a worm in a single, fixed-screen environment and moves at a steady pace. Only four buttons are used to guide it in four directions. The goal is to survive as long as possible without bumping into a wall of the worm's own tail. Starting small, the worm grows by moving over fruit to eat it, causing its tail to extend. There are also other items such as coins that can be collected, adding to a score.</p>\n<p>There are four game modes: Campaign (all levels in a sequence), Arcade (play single, unlocked levels), Multiplayer (for up to four players) and Build to create custom levels.</p>",
