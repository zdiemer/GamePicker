If he gets hit by any of the enemies, then he'll cry and lose a life forcing you to start all the way from the beginning. You can get 20 - 100 points every time you jump over the obstacles. There are five scenes in total and the game loops but the sky changes colors that shows morning, evening, and night. You get an extra life when you pass a scene and collect all the fish rice bowls to move on and you can't go on unless you get all of the required amount.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Baikin-Kun's Switch On</em> is an action-packed platformer where you step into the shoes of Baikin-Kun, navigating a room filled with switches while evading relentless mice. Your primary objective is to activate the dark blue switches, avoiding the bright blue and red ones to prevent electrocution \u2013 ensuring they're off and pink is key.</p>\n<p>As you progress, yellow, green, and blue mice will join the chase, each with their own unique behavior. Utilize your jumping skills to overcome obstacles and evade enemies, and keep an eye out for a helpful cat that can assist in clearing out the mice, granting you bonus points when caught.</p>\n<p>Once you've dispatched all the mice by electrocution, your task shifts to activating all switches before the time runs out, earning points and an extra life upon successful completion. Failure to do so will result in losing a life and progressing to the next stage. The game offers two modes: Game A - the arcade mode, and Game B - the custom mode, which serves as a practice mode for those seeking an additional challenge. There are 255 acts in each mode.</p>\n<p>Should you exhaust all your lives, Baikin-Kun will be shown injured alongside a blue mouse, signaling the end of the game.</p>",
