The objective is to hit the moving ball past your opponent's side, winning a point, while preventing your opponent from doing the same to you. At all times, the players must avoid the top or bottom of the screen (otherwise, it's called \"ball off the table\").</p>\n<p>There's no score keeping on screen, so the players must keep score by themselves. The first player to get 21 points with a two point margin, wins the match. Otherwise, play is continued until that margin is attained by one of the players.</p>",

One player starts in planet ODD while the other starts in planet EVEN and the objective is to be the first to reach the opponent's planet. The ODD player is only allowed to move to a square if it's number summed with EVEN's current square totals an ODD number, and vice-versa.</p>\n<p><em>Hockey</em> is another evolution of <em>Table Tennis</em>, but this time around your objective is to hit the ball into the net of the opposing player's side.</p>\n<p><em>Football</em> is probably the first rendition of American Football on videogame form. With the assistance of deck cards (provided with the game) you choose the moves (<em>Pass</em>, <em>Kick</em> or <em>Run</em>) and play them out on screen. Running requires <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/25113/cat-and-mouse-football-haunted-house/\">game card #4</a> to be inserted.</p>",

The objective of the detective is to gather the most Clue cards and find the hidden treasure in the mansion, while the objective of the ghost is to slow the detective down.</p>",

It works with game card #3 originally supplied with the system, and is played both on-screen and on the included game board.</p>\n<p>The goal is to build a \"train of thought\" across the game board, blocking the other player's path. The thought tiles required for this can be bought by points earned in the on-screen part of the game. There, the defending player rolls his dice to decide how many fields he may move his spot through maze. The attacking player then tries to serve the ball with such a trajectory that it hits the defender. If the defender is in a spot where he is easier to hit, the attacker gains less points.</p>",
