On the player's turn there are five possible commands: show country status, transport defenses, show global status, spy mission and attack. Units come in the form of troops, planes, artillery, tanks and missiles. They can be moved between territories and each territory has four quadrants in which they can be placed (north, east, south and west). Units that are placed on enemy territories will battle when the attack command is ordered. When the battle is over the final remaining units of the losing participant are added to the winner's. Spy missions involve sending planes and will inform the player of troop concentration in enemy territories, each mission costs 10 planes and the are lost forever.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Drelbs</em> is loosely inspired by the paper-based game played on a grid of dots, in which players draw lines alternately, with the intention of forming more squares than their opponent. The similarities end there; in <em>Drelbs</em> you represent the only member of the Drelb race who has not been imprisoned by the evil Trolloboars. Members of the Gorgolyte race and Trolloboar tanks are targeting you.</p>\n<p>A set of randomly-arranged lines are already in place, and contact with them pushes them in the direction of contact. Forming a complete square locks it into place, and it turns into either a monster (causing death on contact), a woman (resulting in bonus points on contact) or a barrier. They will randomly change into stairways, which can lead you into a bonus room.</p>",
