        "description": "<p>The year is 2016. An airplane is hijacked by unknown terrorists. On the board of the plane is senator Hach, an important US politician, who might be the next president of the country. In exchange for the senator, the terrorist want something from the US government. You don't know what that something is, but it goes under the code name \"Pythagoras\". Since handing it over to the terrorist is not what the government is planning to do, it sends you, the famous special agent Solid Snake, to rescue the senator and to find out who is really behind the hijacking.</p>\n<p>\"Metal Gear Acid\" is set in the familiar Metal Gear universe and graphically resembles the PS2 titles of the series, but its gameplay is quite different from that of the other games. \"Metal Gear Acid\" combines the traditional stealth gameplay with strategy. It is a turn-based game in which you plan your turns by selecting playing cards that are available in your card deck. Each card represents an action: attacking, moving, etc. You must plan your actions carefully to stay unnoticed and also plan ahead which cards you'd want to keep during the next round, and which you are ready to sacrifice in order to make an efficient move immediately.</p>",

The 8 games modes include: Drift Attack, Nitrous Run, Drag Race, Car Spec, Lap Knockout, Circuit, and a new one for the PSP - Rally Relay. The 10 racing circuits feature track layouts exclusive to this version. You can tune and customize your cars like the other games in the Underground Series and you can have a Pocket Garage to show them off.</p>\n<p>If you decide to go head-to-head via Wi-Fi, watchout 'cause you opponent could own your car if they win. Get up to 4 people to play together via Wi-Fi as well.</p>\n<p>What would Underground be without the great music tracks? Rivals is no exception, it has 38 tracks already seen, but it also has 6 new songs with the music videos to them.</p>",

Strange things are now occurring and it is up to you, the Guardian, to investigate and fight back this evil to once again bring peace to the safe haven of Aven.</p>\n<p>Untold Legends is an action RPG in which you control a single character in search of answers to the strange occurrences happening to Aven. Choose from 4 different character classes each with his/her own special abilities: The Knight \u2013 a typical melee fighter with heavy weapons and armor with the ability to duel-wield, The Alchemist \u2013 a ranged fighter with the ability to use potions and scrolls as magic, The Druid \u2013 a ranged fighter that can call upon the earth for offensive and defensive magic and The Berserker \u2013 an unwieldy character bent on brutality and destruction with the ability to duel-wield. Despite a character strength or weakness for melee or ranged combat all characters can switch between them. </p>\n<p>Complete quests in a wide variety of location from in-town to dungeons to dark monster lairs. Collect weapons, armor, accessories, potions and gold along the way from enemies you slay, chests you open and vases you smash open. Combine components with weapons and armor to enhance them and give you more power, health etc. Use gold to purchase new weapons, armor, etc. in town.</p>\n<p>Your character starts out with attributes (strength, intelligence, dexterity and stamina) unique to that class that can be raised each time your character achieves a new level. Along with raising attributes at each level you can assign points to your special abilities and gain new abilities. Each class has its own weapons and armor specially suited for that class that can only be equipped by that class.</p>\n<p>The game is completely 3D in which you use the analog stick to move your character. The world can be rotated and zoomed in close to get a good look at the enemies your fighting. Your characters weapons (along with special abilities embedded in weapons like fire or lightening) and armor are animated on your character and change each time you equip a new item. </p>\n<p>Play a single player game or a multiplayer wireless game with 3 of your friends.</p>",

Players take part in a futuristic racing league known as the FX300 Racing League and control a fast hovercrafts on tight, cornering tracks, vying for first place in one of many tournaments. There are ten anti-gravity vehicles available to use (two need to be unlocked), each with their own characteristics in speed, handling and acceleration. Vehicles are further divided into classes that are unlocked gradually. In later classes most of the vehicles become much faster and require more precise steering at fast speeds. In the same vein, players can unlock new tournaments.</p>\n<p>There are a total of sixteen tracks to race on: twelve designed from the ground up for the PSP, as well as four classic <em>Wipeout</em> tracks. Each track has its own obstacles, as well as weapon pick-ups (both offensive and defensive) and speed boosters. The different game modes include single races, tournaments of sets of races, time trial and zone races. In the zone races the player goes through a number of increasingly difficult zones on his own without the ability to slow down until the vehicle explodes because of collision damage. New game elements are unlocked through the Tournament mode.</p>\n<p>The game features wireless play over ad-hoc mode (PSP-to-PSP). It was also the first PSP game to support downloadable content with extra teams, tracks and PSP skins. Some of these packs are only available for specific regional versions. The European version of the game supports game sharing.</p>",

        "description": "<p>NBA Street for the Playstation Portable handheld system.  </p>\n<p>NBA Street is a street-rules, three-on-three basketball series.  NBA Street Showdown is the first version of the series for the PSP handheld system.  Developed in parallel with NBA Street Vol. 3, it contains elements of Vol. 2 and Vol. 3, as well as many unique features.</p>\n<p>The primary game mode is King of the Courts.  There are eleven courts, each owned by a boss character.  The goal is to own and defend all of the courts in the game by defeating the boss character on each court and any challengers to your claim to the court.</p>\n<p>The player first creates their own  baller and team.  Most courts are initially locked, and the player must compete in a tournament-style progression on each court to unlock others.  Winning the final match against the boss character allows the player owns that court, unlocks new courts, and gives the player the opportunity to take a member of the defeated team.</p>\n<p>There are two mini-games included as short distractions for moments when there is not enough time for a full game, or just for fun.</p>\n<p>The goal of the Shot Blocker mini-game is essentially what the name suggests - you are a single player, facing a varying number of shooters, and it is your job to prevent their shots from hitting the net.  Too many strikes in a row and it's game over.  Points for blocking are greatest close to the shooters, and lowest near the basket, but it takes longer to get into position for a block the further you are from the basket.  The more shots you block in a row, the faster your points accumulate.  Occasionally there is a \"money ball\" thrown, giving additional points if you block it.  If you do well enough, you continue on to a new level.</p>\n<p>Arcade Shootout is much like an arcade basketball machine, where you need to sink as many baskets as possible before time runs out.  If you meet the required number of baskets for a level, you will advance to the next level.  Each level is different, with multiple baskets arranged in different patters, and each with a different bonus or point value.  To mix things up, some of the baskets move back and forth, making them even harder to hit.  Bonus points are awarded for making two or three baskets with the same ball.</p>\n<p>Multiplayer modes consist of two-player network play via the PSP's built-in wireless network, and Party Play where players take turns on the same PSP competing for the highest score in the mini-games.</p>\n<p>There are WiFi multi-play modes for standard three-on-three pickup games, as well as multiplayer modes for both Shot Blocker and Arcade Shootout.  In Shot Blocker multiplayer, you compete head-to-head against the other player on the same court to block the same shots.  For Arcade Shootout multiplayer, you are competing on the same machine to get more points than your opponent.</p>",

Single play modes include stroke play in which you can play a free round of golf alone, three different challenge modes (stroke \u2013 play against nineteen computer characters in a tournament, match \u2013 a one on one match against a computer character with the first player to go ahead by three holes winning automatically unlocking items for your character and VS \u2013 play against a computer character like in match play and instead of getting items you unlock the character you are playing against to be a playable character). There is also a training mode available to practice a single hole or course with the ability to set the conditions you wish to practice under like wind direction, weather etc. Playing in single player mode you also will have the ability to increase your rank by winning tournaments. When you rank up you will unlock new courses and caddies. </p>\n<p>Multi-player mode allows up to 8 people to link up and play match play \u2013 one on one play from 3 to 18 holes, tournament \u2013 a stroke style game with up to 8 players on 9 to 18 holes and Putting Challenge \u2013 one on one game where you compete for Putt Points using only a putter on a green with several holes and the object being to sink your ball in a single putt, the farther the hole the more Putt Points you get. Putting Challenge is also available in single player mode. Special rule can be applied in multi-player mode such as 2 points added to sand traps, no backspin, XL Cup (a giant cup is used), Crazy Gauge (the cursor on the power gauge for hitting the ball jumps around) etc. You can taunt your opponent when its there turn by pressing on the direction buttons or any of the other buttons. The taunts differ from character to character.</p>\n<p>Selecting Data from the main menu will display your records from single player golf, history (your achievements so far \u2013 medals, etc.) and videos of shots to be saved for further viewing. Selecting Options in the main menu allows further tweaking of the game such as camera angles, easy mode and playing of movies you have saved.</p>",

While the overall storyline remains the same, the design of some characters and locations has been changed to have a slightly more comical edge. A few locations have been removed completely, and the layout of several others has been changed significantly. A few plot-related sections that were not present in the original release appear in this version, e.g. a sub-plot involving the Anubis Stone. Voice acting has been added. Unlike the original, there is no alternate ending in this version: the protagonist reaches the Hall of Heroes even if the player did not manage to collect all the chalices.</p>",

Dr. Cain's discovery of X led to the creation of reploids, robots modeled after the design of X. When the maverick virus infects a group of reploids, they band together in a revolt against humanity. The call goes to the maverick hunters, X and Zero, to fight the Mavericks.</p>\n<p>The game is a side-scrolling action game where the player controls X as he hunts the maverick reploids. Notable features include the ability to find enhancements to augment X's abilities, and the ability to absorb the powers of the maverick reploids X defeats. The original moves, such as dashes, wall jumps and charge shorts are still present.</p>\n<p>The original flat backgrounds have been replaced by polygonal models, and the remake features enhanced explosions and generally more detail. Additionally, animated cutscenes and voice acting have been added. All weapon and armour upgrades have been relocated to new hidden areas, and there is a new mode: Vile, in which you can play the entire game as maverick Vile, with abilities Mega Man does not have. As a bonus, there is a demo of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/22090/mega-man-powered-up/\">Mega Man Powered Up</a> on the UMD - a remake of the very first <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Mega+Man\">Mega Man</a> game.</p>",

        "description": "<p>FIA licensed Formula 1 racing game including the 2005 season teams, drivers, cars, and circuits. The player controls the car on the track and tries to either complete a lap in fastest possible time, or race against either computer controlled drivers (or in multiplayer mode, against other players) and finish in top position.</p>\n<p>Game can be played in <em>Quick Grand Prix</em>, <em>Event</em>, <em>World Championship</em>, and <em>Multiplayer</em> modes. <em>Quick Grand Prix</em> selects a random car and circuit to race. <em>Event</em> modes are <em>Time Attack</em> (race against ghost car), <em>Single Grand Prix</em>, and <em>Scenario Mode</em> in which the player needs to complete different kinds of racing tasks such as completing a lap with failed brakes and pitting in to fix them. Each successfully completed scenario unlocks the next one. Additional scenarios are available for download to PSP.</p>\n<p><em>World Championship</em> mode lets the player to choose the team to race in and the championship season difficulty. All 19 circuits of the 2005 F1 season are raced in order and points for finishing in positions 1-8 are awarded. Driver with most points at the end of the season wins the championship. Before each race the player can drive practice laps to get familiar with the track and the car setup. Player can also drive a single lap qualifying run which will determine the grid position at the race start.</p>\n<p>The difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) define the total number of laps, weather conditions, pit stops, and tyre wear. Initially only the easy level is selectable and must be completed successfully in top three in order to unlock the medium level. In same manner, the medium level must be completed in top three to unlock the hard level. Also the <em>Single Grand Prix Event</em> is unlocked by successfully completing the easy level.</p>\n<p>In <em>Multiplayer</em> mode, up to 8 players can play in three different race types. As in singleplayer <em>Time Attack</em>, each car races against top time ghost car. Both <em>Head to Head</em> and <em>Single Grand Prix</em> modes allow players to race a single grand prix, the difference being that in the latter mode, computer controlled AI drivers are entered to fill the grid if less than eight players enter.</p>\n<p>F1 Grand Prix also includes a <em>TV Mode Race</em> where AI cars race each other and the player has no control, except selecting the camera view.</p>\n<p>All 2005 season cars are initially available but the game has unlockable F1 cars from past years, such as Lotus-Climax 25, turbo powered Williams FW11, and Cosworth classics Lotus-Ford 79 and Williams FW08. Overall game style is more arcade than simulation, eg. collisions do not cause any noticeable damage, after a spin-out the car is automatically pointed to the right direction, and driving off-track slows the car down. A simple car setup system has three presets: Defensive, Balanced, and Aggressive. Player can also enable Brake Assist which automatically applies brakes in corners if the speed is too high.</p>",

Since rally is driven so that the track is clear of other cars, competitors are shown as ghost cars. Co-drivers notes are both spoken and shown on the screen to aid in navigating the often twisty stages.</p>\n<p>Game can be played in <em>Quick Rally</em>, <em>Time Trial</em>, <em>Single Rally</em>, <em>Championship</em>, and <em>Multiplayer</em> modes. <em>Quick Rally</em> selects a random car and rally stage to race. In <em>Time Trial</em>, a ghost car is shown on the track and the player's goal is to beat its time on that stage. In <em>Single Rally</em> mode, player chooses the team and car to drive with and needs to complete all the stages in a single rally. Other drivers are shown as ghost cars.</p>\n<p><em>Championship</em> mode extends the <em>Single Rally</em> mode into full season of 16 rallies. Each rally has two to four stages and the player must reach certain position in order to advance to the next stage. Difficulty level (novice, professional, expert, extreme) defines the number of stages per rally and the required finishing position. Expert and extreme levels are unlocked by completing the preceding level. After each rally, points are awarded to top 8 drivers and the championship is won by most points at the end of the season. Completing championship modes also unlocks new car types and rally stages for other play modes.</p>\n<p><em>Multiplayer</em> modes include both offline (hot-seat) and online play. The hot-seat rallies are for up to four players and allow the players to compete in <em>Time Trial</em>, <em>Single Rally</em>, and <em>Championship</em> modes. Online wireless play allows up to eight players to race together on a single stage. As in other modes, competitors are shown as ghost cars.</p>\n<p>The game has an arcade-style control scheme (no manual gear changes for example) and a simple damage model. Damaging the car has visual impact on the car and on expert and extreme levels, damage affects the car performance too.

        "description": "<p><em>Darkstalkers Chronicle: The Chaos Tower</em> is essentially the culmination of Capcom's sister series to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Street+Fighter\">Street Fighter</a>. Featuring a similar style of one-on-one 2D fighter gameplay, which focuses heavily on a system of varied kicks, punches and special moves differentiating each fighter, the Darkstalkers series differentiated itself by providing a very unique cast of characters inspired by nearly every classic movie monster one could think of.</p>\n<p>The game is a port of the Dreamcast title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8605/vampire-chronicle-for-matching-service/\">Vampire Chronicle For Matching Service</a> and collects every playable character from the series, with interpretations of famous monsters, and every distinct style of play from the series, in one title. New gameplay modes have been added to the mix as well. Among them is the Chaos Tower, where the player is challenged to pick three characters and climb the ranks in the tower, taking on each challenge given. The other ones are Training, Chronicle and Arcade.</p>\n<p>Multiplayer is available in the Network mode via WiFi, in standard versus modes, and also as a league mode where 4 players can battle it out in a tournament-styled setting.</p>",

Finally able to explore past the secure boundaries of Haven City, Daxter inadvertently takes on a job as a pest exterminator, a task the Old Sage intuitively knew he was proficient at since the first <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6792/jak-and-daxter-the-precursor-legacy/\">Jak and Daxter</a>. Armed with a fly swatter and soon afterwards a spray canister that allows him to not only stun bugs but to hover in the air, Daxter unravels to the player the introduction of the upcoming invasion that occurred in Jak II into Haven City. The invasion is led by the Metal Heads who are using bug-like variations called Metal Bugs to permeate the city. Later upgrades include a flame thrower attachment as well as a detonator weapon.</p>\n<p>Daxter's path towards freeing Jak involves a series of platforming and combat challenges through a wide variety of environments ranging from a high speed transit system to a fish cannery, and all the way to the Krimson Guard fortress where Daxter has to sneak past the guards to eventually save Jak.</p>\n<p>Daxter features a variety of vehicle levels, minigames typical of the Jak series, as well as a series of dream level sequences that take Daxter into a realm where he is the hero. The dream minigames spoof cinematic moments from <em>The Matrix</em>, <em>Indiana Jones</em>, <em>Braveheart</em> and <em>Lord of the Rings.</em> Wi-fi multiplayer mode of Bug combat is included, where players can use their trained collected bugs to fight each other.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Lord of the Rings: Tactics is a completely original strategy game set in Tolkien's Middle-Earth. Players experience the entire trilogy, from the earliest battle at Weathertop to the final conclusion at Minas Tirith and Mordor.</p>\n<p>Unlike other tactics games, which are strictly straightforward turn-based affairs, The Lord of the Rings: Tactics innovates in its system. Players assign their moves simultaneously with the AI, and then all the actions unfold. In this way, players must guess their opponent's intentions and try to block them before they actually happen. This keeps the action moving much faster than a traditional tactics game.</p>\n<p>The game features over 24 levels and includes the vast majority of characters from the films, such as Aragorn and Gandalf, the hobbits, as well as key villains such as Saruman and the Balrog. Players can choose between good and evil campaigns, so the entire game can be experienced from each of their perspectives.</p>\n<p>Characters can level up, gain abilities, and purchase equipment between levels, reminiscent of EA's The Third Age game. Since the battles are mostly small skirmishes, your characters' attributes and abilities (or lack thereof) can easily swing battles.</p>\n<p>Finally, the game also offers a multiplayer skirmish mode for up to four players. Players purchase units and allies using a flexible point system, choose a battle location, and try to take out each other's teams.</p>",

One of these robots is named \"Mega\" and is designed to help Light around the lab in various tasks. One day, evil Dr. Wily attacks the lab and turn all of the robots evil too. All except Mega. Dr. Light sends Mega to stop these robots and thus, Mega Man is born.</p>\n<p><em>Mega Man: Powered Up</em> is a semi-remake of the original <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/mega-man-\">Mega Man</a>.\nThere is an \"Old Mode\", where one tackles the adventure just like it was in the olden days, with the exception of an added feature to save game. The graphics are souped up, but the level layout is basically the same as in the original with a few minor changes here and there.\nThen there's the \"New Mode\" which also features the original level themes and bosses but the levels themselves are boosted with various hidden areas and features which are mostly impossible to get to with Megaman only. The Player must defeat the bosses after which they'll be available as playable characters and use their special abilities to find everything in every level.</p>\n<p>The third mode is the Challenge Mode where there is 100 different challenges to tackle and in which one has to dispatch as many enemies as possible in a given amount of time, get to the specific goal in a given amount of time and so on.</p>\n<p>In addition to these two main game modes, there is a level editor that can be used to build the Megaman level of one's dreams and play it or send it to the internet where other gamers can download and play it.</p>",

It follows the gameplay style established by Konami's Beatmania series, where the player is presented with a sheet of notes falling down the screen. As the notes fall, the player hits the correct key at the correct time, and in effect they play along with the music, activating key parts of the song. </p>\n<p>Unlike the PC version, which emphasizes competitive online multiplayer, DJ Max Portable is limited to being a strictly solitary experience. It features fifty tracks ranging in styles from techno to trance to dance and to some R&amp;B music. Further extending the longevity of the game is the ability to select from a variety of difficulty levels, denoted by the number of buttons used (i.e. 4key, 6key, 8key) to play the song.</p>",

For instance, destroying a weapons cache in a Fireteam Bravo mission may reduce the ability for enemies in a corresponding SOCOM 3 mission to use high-end guns.</p>\n<p>Finally, the title is the first to support the PSP's headset peripheral for communicating with teammates in online multiplayer gameplay.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The King of All Cosmos, The Queen, and The Prince have decided to take a holiday. However, a huge tidal wave washes away the island homes of the local animals! They ask for help from the King, who requests that the Prince and his Cousins roll up nice large Katamaris so that they can be turned into new islands for the animals.</p>\n<p>Me &amp; My Katamari is the third game in the popular Katamari Damacy series. The basic gameplay is the same: you, as the tiny Prince, must roll a ball around the landscape. Any objects that are the same size or smaller than the ball (called a Katamari) will adhere to it. The general objective of the game is to get the Katamari as large as possible, but some animals will request specific tasks, such as making the Katamari as old as possible (roll up living things for their age), and to roll up as much fuel as possible to make a rocket ship blast off.</p>\n<p>Me &amp; My Katamari features an assortment of unique songs from both Katamari Damacy and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=We+Love+Katamari\">We Love Katamari</a>. The game also supports Wireless Multiplayer for up to four players, where the object of the game is again to roll up as much as possible, with the addition of being able to roll up your opponents if you're large enough.</p>",

He doesn't know much about his past, but is well aware of his skills, as are his newly acquired companions. Returning back to the US from a mission well done, his only hope is that he'll start remembering his past as he steps on a friendly soil. But instead of having some time to do so, an FBI agent takes him and his friends into custody, leaving him with only one option to save his friends, and that is to help the agent with a mission of his own. Reluctant but left with little to ponder about, Snake agrees until he can connect some dots.</p>\n<p>Unlike the prior game, the game uses a 3D cell-shading technique making the game less realistic but more colorful, now spanning over 500 cards at your disposal. Gameplay is basically the same turn-based style as the original, though comes with certain enhancements like being able to undo your moves to a certain degree, or moving in real-time and not losing moves on opening doors or crouching. There is also a new type of cards that is self-triggered when you use other cards, usually enhancing your action in one way or another.</p>\n<p>The Metal Gear Ac!d 2 package comes with a Solid Eye, a special type of 3D glasses (a cardboard box that slides over the PSP, not the blue-purple plastic but with lenses) to play the game with a 3D effect. You can also use it to watch various <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/15735/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater/\">Snake Eater</a> and other movies as you unlock them in the game, giving you the feeling of 3D space.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Cars</em> is an arcade racer based on the Disney/Pixar movie of the same name. The player can unlock and drive vehicles through numerous tracks and environments from the world of Carburetor County. The game features authentic voiceover talent from the movie and provides a variety of ways to race (Story Mode with elements from the film, Grand Prix where you unlock tracks, Custom Race and Postcard Races with collectibles).</p>\n<p>Unlike the console versions, there is no free-roaming and there is less focus on the story. Evil cars have taken over the tracks and Lightning McQueen and his friends have to defeat them, loosely based on elements from the film, in 25 events. WiFi adhoc multiplayer is supported for up to four racers. Three game modes are available in multiplayer (Single Race, Postcard Race and Multiplayer Grand Prix). The tracks have dynamic elements with shortcuts and you can collect boost by drafting or sliding, for additional speed or even a jump.</p>\n<p>Video clips from the Disney/Pixar movie and from the game itself are also available.</p>",

Therefore, a special unit is formed to deal with such a threat, a special unit called the Pursuit Force. You are part of that unit.</p>\n<p>Your task is to hunt down the criminals and let none escape. To do so, you will drive your fast car on the streets while being perfectly able to switch the vehicles on the run. Yes, on the run, you can jump from car to car during high speed, usually jumping on the different cars from the criminals and taking them out one by one. But there's more to that than just driving different cars, you can drive motorcycles, trucks, boats, even commandeer a helicopter, though there are occasions you'll have to deal with the criminals on foot.</p>\n<p>You can select Time Trial, Race, or Career mode. The latter one plays story-wise which gives you certain variety of cases to choose from. As you get promoted while successfully solving the cases, new cases will become available depending upon your rank, from mere Officer to police Commander. This is a highly fast-paced game with non-stop action, as most missions leave very little room for mistakes.</p>",

A meteor has crash-landed on their planet, bringing with it the black, shaggy Moja Troop, who just happen to find that LocoRoco taste delicious. Soon, they're nearly all gone! It's up to you to take control of the planet using your PSP and repopulate it so that it's full of LocoRoco once more.</p>\n<p><em>LocoRoco</em> is a unique game for the PSP that is very simple to pick up and play. The L and R Buttons tilt the game world to the left and right, causing the LocoRoco to roll in that direction, while pressing both L and R simultaneously makes the world bounce and causes the LocoRoco to jump.</p>\n<p>LocoRoco love to eat, and their favourite fruit is the red berries that are native to the planet. For each one of these that you eat, the LocoRoco grows bigger. It may in fact become too big to squeeze through smaller gaps, however this is not a problem. If you tap the Circle button, the LocoRoco will shriek and break up into smaller ones. If you hold the Circle button, they will all call out and assimilate back into the singular LocoRoco.</p>\n<p>There are also little blue men called 'Mui Mui'. These folk are tucked away in the more hidden parts of the levels. Discover them, and they'll reward you with additional parts to build your own 'Loco House', as well as give you different music tracks to play in it. Your Loco House can be customised to your liking, and then you can watch as a LocoRoco explores it, and possibly earns you even more house parts. You can also share your Loco House with a friend.</p>",

Playing as one of the heroes, the objective of the game is to collect as many gems as possible in order to advance in the world of Frantix. Though there is no story explaining why our hero is venturing through this land of puzzles, it is clear that this must be done as quickly as possible. Each stage has a gem requirement, and you can exit when you have found the required amount. The puzzles are usually based on colored gems that open specific doors.</p>\n<p>There are six worlds (including a tutorial) where you get past hazards such as water and quick sands, avoid patrolling creatures, collect gems, manipulate crates, sneak around, build bridges, and plant explosives. There are also power-ups that allow you to walk over certain surfaces, increase speed, or provide invincibility. With short levels, Frantix can be played for five minutes or an hour with the same satisfaction.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/17318/untold-legends-brotherhood-of-the-blade/\">Brotherhood of the Blade</a>, the story takes place eighteen years after your peaceful home city of Koryn Thal was invaded by a powerful and dangerous warlord. The warlord has taken over as emperor with a reign of oppression where the helpless people are either enslaved or killed by his vicious minions. During this time there is a secret race of shapeshifters who mysteriously begin to disappear, bringing up fear of a plot to eliminate them. As a result, they begin to flee towards the edge of the city towards the walls to evade whatever is capturing or killing their ancient race. </p>\n<p>You are a member of this shapeshifting race, and in the process of literally running for your life, you and several others come across a secret that brings hope to your people that peace and freedom may yet have a chance. </p>\n<p>At the beginning of the game you are allowed to choose a class, from Guardian, Mercenary, Disciple, Prowier and Scout. Each has unique characteristics and special abilities which presents an opportunity to play the game in vastly different natures. The character can be named and his or her look can be customized to your liking. In addition, you can assign points to the attributes of strength, dexterity, intelligence and stamina, each with a specific purpose and use. </p>\n<p>Fighting consists of special abilities, charged attacks and attacks of opportunity. Skill will play an important role in deciding whether or not you will be successful in any battle. A new aspect this game brings to Untold Legends is the multiplayer capability. You can play cooperative or team-based using wireless technology in a proximity or by playing online.</p>",

It is a remake of the first two PoPoLoCrois titles for the PlayStation seamlessly reworked into a single game with various enhancements. You play as the 10-year old Prince Pinon who needs to find way of saving his sleeping beauty mom, and the whole kingdom, from Ancient Evil.</p>\n<p>While playing you are able to pick up different characters to form a party, each with a different personality and combat style. Battles occur randomly and they become semi-strategic turn-based if you turn off the default auto combat option. Combat doesn't take you to a different screen, it just defines a spot in the background moving it to a diagonal grid, where you will move and fight the enemy. In these fights, there are many battle options, from special skills to tag-team attacks. Actions are based on an action gauge that fills up. The game can be saved manually or automatically.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Legend of Heroes</em> is old-school JRPG with new-school sensibilities and graphics. The old-school elements of the game are its turn-based combat, linearity, long dialogue scenes, a digital pet system and lots of similar things that seem to date from the 1995-ish RPG era. There are no random fighting encounters however. In this game you control Avin in his search for his younger sister Eimelle. They were separated when their cathedral was raided by religious zealots.</p>\n<p><em>A Tear of Vermillion</em> is a remake of the Japanese PC game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=legend+heroes+akai\"> Legend of heroes IV: Akai Shizuku</a>. The word <em>Gagharv</em> (in the Japanese title of the remake) refers to the chasm that separates the continent Tirasweel, where the games takes place, from the rest of the world. Improvements Bandai made for this remake are completely re-done 3D graphics, new battle interface, and quicker load times.</p>",

Even though the program was canceled, it kept running and growing inside the network. You infiltrate the world to neutralize it.</p>\n<p>The game offers six sectors to explore, each containing several sub-sections. Each of them has a good selection of different types of weapons you can collect during the levels. Coded Arms also uses \u201cThe Matrix\u201d-style effects.

        "description": "<p>In this surreal game your human avatar stands alone on a platform of blocks facing an army of grey, black, and green cubes (or qubes). As groups of cubes begin an ominous lurching roll in your direction, you must capture each cube (with the exception of the black ones) or be crushed.</p>\n<p>You capture a single cube by lighting a square at your feet, allowing a cube to roll over it, and then activating that lit square. The activated square removes the cube from play. With a bit of planning, you can use special cubes to set off sequences of lit squares that can then capture many cubes at once.</p>\n<p>If any cube rolls off the end of the platform, however, or you capture a black cube, the platform on which you're standing gets a little shorter. Should you get pushed off the end of the platform, you will fall into the black abyss, and to your doom. When your game ends you are assigned a high score, appropriately called an IQ.</p>\n<p>This entry in the Intelligent Qube series is essentially a compilation, including over 7000 levels selected from the three earlier games in the series (<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5183/intelligent-qube/\">Intelligent Qube</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Kurushi+Final\">IQ Final</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/19551/iq-remix-intelligent-qube/\">I.Q. Remix</a>), including 100 Attack modes and a new Survival mode. Next to regular ad-hoc multiplayer, Sony also introduced a new form of game sharing. <em>I.Q. Mania</em> was released at the same time as the puzzlers <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=XI+Coliseum\">XI Coliseum</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Bakufuu+Sentai+Bombermen\">Bakufuu Sentai Bombermen</a>. If you own one of these games and a friend has one as well, you can play multiplayer games for any of them simply by connecting. Each game also includes a demo for the other two games and five multiplayer minigames: Bowling, Kunoichi Densetsu, Double Smash , N.U.M. and Party x Party x Party.</p>",

It spans a wide range of machines, from the primitive Play-Boy of 1932 (pinball sans flippers) up to the Caddyshack-inspired Tee'd Off of 1993 with its LED display and voice samples.</p>\n<p>Every table is open for free play, with the exception of Play-Boy. In the course of playing each table, you can strive to achieve table-specific goals which unlock other features, like Tournament Mode or a novelty game like Xolten. For example, the goal given for Black Hole is to earn multiball mode and the lower playfield special.</p>\n<p>Each table attempts to recreate the original game's look and feel, from the artwork to the original sound effects. For full arcade effect you can see the scoreboard reflected on the table glass and hear arcade background noises, including sound effects from classic videogames like Galaga.</p>\n<p>Each table also comes with instructions on the main features of the table and a smidgen of history. There are other historical artifacts, such as a still photo tour of the Gottlieb factory (a feature which must be unlocked).</p>\n<p>The complete list of tables is: Play-Boy (1932), Ace High (1954), Central Park (1966), Big Shot (1973), Genie (1979), Black Hole (1981), Goin' Nuts (1983), El Dorado City of Gold (1984), Victory (1987), and Tee'd Off (1993), Strikes N\u2019 Spares (1995). It also includes two novelty machines, Love Meter and Xolten.</p>",

Little does U-1 know that he is the last descendant of Gitaroo Man, an incredible superhero with the power to battle foes with his magical guitar. It's up to you, as U-1, to vanquish the villains and win the girl as Gitaroo Man!</p>\n<p><em>Gitaroo Man Lives!</em> is an enhanced remake of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Gitaroo-Man\">Gitaroo Man</a> for the PS2. You take the role of U-1, and fight enemies by playing your guitar. There are multiple phases of battle in <em>Gitaroo Man Lives!</em> The first is the Charge phase - during this phase, you must tilt the Analog Stick in the direction that an on-screen line shows, as well as holding the Circle Button when prompted. The better you do here, the more power you will have to fight with for the Battle Phase. In this phase, you alternate between Attacking (similar to Charge Phase), and Guarding (press the appropriate buttons as they appear on-screen to block attacks.) Success in these two phases will lead you into the Final Phase, where you must finish off your enemy.</p>\n<p><em>Gitaroo Man Lives!</em> is also compatible with Ad Hoc Mode for multiplayer play. Up to two players can play, either choosing to fight against each other in VS Mode, or to play co-operatively in the PSP exclusive Duet Mode. In this mode, all-new songs have been created for two players to battle with.</p>",

There are ten rooms to each level, and each room is timed. Failing to exit the room within the time limit does not result in a game over, but it impacts your overall score for the level, which is an average of all ten rooms. Through the Wi-Fi connection, you can upload your best scores and compare them with others worldwide.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The sequel to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/17231/lumines-puzzle-fusion/\">Lumines</a> stays close the original puzzle game, but add some twists. The gameplay is identical: you arrange blocks, made of four smaller block pieces with two colours in total, to form shapes with an identical colour, as a square of four pieces or more. The blocks can be rotated and are stacked with the other blocks on the board. A vertical line crosses the screen and when it hits the right side, all combinations are removed, causing chain combos and clearing the board. You have to prevent the blocks from piling up and reaching the top of the screen. There are also special blocks you can use to remove many blocks at once. Games are played against colorful backgrounds and the speed of the timeline matches the music of the level, while the falling speed of the blocks increases as you get further in the game.</p>\n<p>The game modes are either new or have been remixed. In the single-player Challenge mode, there are three difficulty classes. By clearing levels you unlock new music, skins and game modes. One of these are the Endurance challenge runs, where you have to play through all skins in the game. Next to games with regular skins, some backgrounds now have 3D animations or show music videos of popular artists. The sound effects and the design of blocks is often adapted to fit the music. For levels with music video skins, you cannot play through them at a quicker pace to clear the level as you have to keep going until the song ends.</p>\n<p>The other single-player modes are Time Attack mode (get a high score with limited time, you can even record your session) and Puzzle mode where you need to create shapes. You can also challenge the computer in the VS CPU Mode. Here, you need to score more than your opponent to make his playing field smaller until he gets stuck. This game type is also available as the Duel mode against a human player through Wi-Fi. The order of the skins can be defined in the new Skin Edit mode. The Single Lap section allows you to make your own playlists for a set run, while the Endless Lap allows you to choose or exclude skins to keep playing as long as you like. There are 60 levels and 100 skins in total.</p>\n<p>Another new feature is the Mission mode where more strategy is required. You are given specific tasks to clear boards with a limited amount of blocks or time. In the new Sequencer mode, you can compose your own songs. The game provides options to define the speed and 8 separate music sheets to place notes and effects on. The high scores, playlists from the Skin Edit mode, songs from the Sequencer mode and replays of the Time Attack mode can be exchanged with other players through Wi-Fi. Your performance is tracked in the Database mode where statistics of your playing sessions are available. The game also includes a demo of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/26531/every-extend-extra/\">Every Extend Extra</a>, another puzzle game by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/6156/q-entertainment-inc/\">Q ENTERTAINMENT, Inc.</a></p>",

Select one of six game types (DM, TDM, CTF and three others) in one of eight arenas (e.g. Russian Silo, New Mexico canyon, Arctic Tundra) for the right to wear the BattleZone championship crown. </p>\n<p>Fight the way you want to fight choosing a light, medium, or heavy tank chassis and improving it with your favorite weapons and customizing it with your favorite tweak tune-ups. It's all about personality and choice while beating down AI in single-player, and your friends over WiFi multiplayer. </p>\n<p>The single player campaign simulates a 20-match season on the semi-futuristic BattleZone circuit. Represent one of eight NATO countries and battle for pride against the others in their home arenas across the globe. Each country has a special weapon representing their style of play. Configure your tank by hot-swapping between fifteen weapons that are fully automatic, self-guided, or totally exotic.</p>",

Games can be played in the original aspect ratios (windowed in the middle of the screen), or stretched for a full-screen view. The game supports game sharing so two players can play with a single copy through an Ad Hoc network. There are different difficulty levels and you can save the game state to continue playing later. High scores are recorded and you can unlock achievements such as original gamer patches and vintage TV commercials.</p>\n<p>The following games are included:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/25/activision-publishing-inc/\">Activision</a></strong> titles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/11026/barnstorming/\">Barnstorming</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8929/beamrider/\">Beamrider</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/11589/boxing/\">Boxing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Bridge\">Bridge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Checkers\">Checkers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9331/chopper-command/\">Chopper Command</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/11498/cosmic-commuter/\">Cosmic Commuter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10005/crackpots/\">Crackpots</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/11537/the-activision-decathlon/\">Decathlon</a> (The Activision Decathlon)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/11497/dolphin/\">Dolphin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10474/dragster/\">Dragster</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/11588/enduro/\">Enduro</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10429/fishing-derby/\">Fishing Derby</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9173/freeway/\">Freeway</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/11428/frostbite/\">Frostbite</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Grand+Prix\">Grand Prix</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=H.E.R.O.\">H.E.R.O.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/20811/ice-hockey/\">Ice Hockey</a></li>\n<li>Kabobber (previously unreleased)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Kaboom!\">Kaboom!</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Keystone+Kapers\">Keystone Kapers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Laser+Blast\">Laser Blast</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9011/megamania/\">Megamania</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Oink!\">Oink!</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pitfall!\">Pitfall!</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pitfall+II:+Lost+Caverns\">Pitfall II: Lost Caverns</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10452/plaque-attack/\">Plaque Attack</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9807/pressure-cooker/\">Pressure Cooker</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10413/private-eye/\">Private Eye</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=River+Raid\">River Raid</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9074/river-raid-ii/\">River Raid II</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9695/robot-tank/\">Robot Tank</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10455/seaquest/\">Seaquest</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10657/skiing/\">Skiing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/19034/sky-jinks/\">Sky Jinks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Space+Shuttle\">Space Shuttle</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10430/spider-fighter/\">Spider Fighter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9067/stampede/\">Stampede</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/19166/starmaster/\">Starmaster</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tennis\">Tennis</a></li>\n<li>Thwocker (previously unreleased)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/56/imagic/\">Imagic</a></strong> titles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10248/atlantis/\">Atlantis</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9448/demon-attack/\">Demon Attack</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/13909/moonsweeper/\">Moonsweeper</a></li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p><em>Most Wanted 5-1-0</em>, of which the numerals refer to the police code for street racing, is the second Need for Speed game to be released on the PSP. Just like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Need+for+Speed:+Most+Wanted\">Need for Speed: Most Wanted</a>, the game is centered around a career mode and Blacklist 15, where you need to work your way up a ranking by beating several racers. There is no storyline however, and the cutscenes have also been removed.</p>\n<p>Progress is achieved by completing several events (milestones). There are regular races, but also heat challenges where you need to get the cops off your tail, or break through roadblocks. You can try to outrun the cops, but the levels also contain pursuit breakers; special events that can slow down the chase. The PSP version adds new modes such as Tuner Takedown where you race as a cop and take down the street racers with a limited amount of time. Another one is Double Down, where you need to win races with a full heat meter. Unlike the console versions, you cannot roam freely in the city to search events. Instead, you move from event to event straight away.</p>\n<p>There is a large variety in cars and customization, but with a trimmed-down selection in general. Multiplayer games are available for up to four players, through Wi-Fi Ad Hoc or Infrastructure.</p>",

You once again take the role of Templar, two months after the events in the previous game, taking the war to the Helghast. The ISA managed to push them back previously, but they have reorganized and you need to defeat the insidious General Metrac who has occupied most of southern Vekta, in 16 missions.</p>\n<p>New to the franchise is the top-down/third-person perspective, instead of the PS2's first-person pure FPS approach. During the action, you can switch to a tactical overview to plan your actions. The screen zooms out and the actions are slowed down, while icons pop up to show the different actions and objectives. You will sometimes fight alongside a soldier named Rico, to whom you can issue orders and also commandeer vehicles. The missions require you to plant explosives, sabotage installations, rescue hostages and infiltrate military territory. Aiming is simplified by a drastic amount of auto-aiming, but the game presents many simultaneous enemies appearing in return.</p>\n<p>Prior to each mission, you can customize your character with points. Up to three upgradable abilities can be modified before each new task, to carry more ammo for specific weapons, or to inflict more damage. These points can be earned during challenge missions where you need to show your shooting skills or complete actions such as disarming mines in a limited amount of time.</p>\n<p>The game comes with a full range of Ad Hoc settings for multiplayer, with co-op and competitive play modes included, such as Deathmatch, Assault and Capture the Flag for up to six players.</p>",

It has typical Sonic gameplay, but with a twist - players race through 2.5D stages against a CPU character, only progressing when they get to the end of the stage first.</p>\n<p>You can choose from five characters: Sonic, Knuckles, Shadow, Silver, and Metal Sonic. There are six zones in the story mode, split into two acts with a boss at the end of the second act. Defeating bosses is not sufficient, players also need to do it before the opponent gets the job done. Next to the story mode, there is also a challenge mode and a cup mode. In the wireless play mode players can challenge other PSP owners. While racing, players can collect power-ups with special attacks. Opponents can also be pushed around during the race.</p>\n<p>Players can also collect cards by completing certain tasks in the game and these cards can be traded in the wireless play mode.</p>",

In advanced gameplay, the game requires you to think ahead and make chain series with strategic shots.

In this installment of the 3D beat-em-up series, an ancient evil has returned. The characters fight to become the Champion of the Elder Gods to earn the power to challenge and defeat this evil.</p>\n<p>All characters have a vast arsenal of moves, with weapons, and fatalities. The arenas are multi-tiered, interactive and contain death traps. Next to the regular battles, you can play a free-roaming adventure in the Konquest Mode, battle an endless wave of opponents in the Endurance Mode (exclusive for the PSP), go head-to-head over Wi-Fi against another human player, or try a mini-game such as Chess Kombat (chess with the MK characters) and Puzzle Kombat (<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tetris\">Tetris</a> with a twist).</p>",

Snake has been captured and imprisoned in an abandoned missile silo in Colombia, and with no support this time. At least, not at first. With the help of a fellow prisoner, Snake escapes and the game truly begins.</p>\n<p>Portable Ops is a classic Metal Gear game in almost every sense. The controls will be familiar to anyone who has played previous console entries in the series. Snake can peek around corners, sneak up behind guards... they even carried over CQC (Close Quarters Combat) from Snake Eater.</p>\n<p>What really sets Portable Ops apart (aside from being on the PSP) is the pacing, and a few changes to the gameplay mechanics. The game is played out in missions, which are specific to certain areas. Most of the areas are not that large, which sometimes means seeing \"Mission Complete\" in only a matter of minutes. The ability to play through the game in segments really lends itself to the handheld format. If you only have five minutes, choose a quick mission, knock it out, save and you are done. Being able to return to each area whenever you want to procure more supplies means that even once you finish your mission, you will be coming back.</p>\n<p>Gathering supplies is also essential due to the main new mechanic found in Portable Ops: recruiting. While Snake starts out on his own, he can enlist disgruntled guards, frustrated technicians, stubborn doctors and more. These soldiers can be used in your \"Sneaking Unit\" (the team you take into battle for each mission), or in one of the many support units, with certain soldiers having a more natural talent for certain areas. If you put someone who has medical bonuses in your Medical unit, they can produce rations, help your troops recover faster between missions and more. Technicians can create new items for your team, and Spies can steal ammo and give you intel on specific maps, which can open up new side missions or allow you to grab some heavy weaponry.</p>\n<p>Missions themselves range from recon to rescue to demolitions and beyond. You can only take four troops into a mission, and usually one of them has to be Snake. However, you don't have to always use Snake during the mission, he just has to be present. You can only control one character at a time, while the rest of the team hides safely inside boxes (usually right by the entry point). On the field, the soldier you use can make a big difference. Many times you can totally bypass a building's defenses just by playing as a guard. If you do not do anything to draw attention to yourself, you can oftentimes walk right past the enemy, plant some TNT, and walk away.</p>\n<p>Several soldiers even have special abilities that come in handy during a mission, such as being able to transfer extra items you pick up directly to your truck (each character is limited to four inventory slots), or drag unconscious enemies twice as fast.</p>\n<p>The game supports multiplayer for up to six player simultaneously, over WiFi Ad Hoc and Infrastructure, with game modes such as Team Death Match, Death Match and Capture Mission.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Monster Hunter Freedom</em> is a port of the Japan-only <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Monster+Hunter+G\">Monster Hunter G</a>, a sort of follow-up to the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Monster+Hunter\">Monster Hunter</a> - more of a director's cut of the game. While a good deal of the game mirrors the Playstation 2 original, there have been a large number of additions. There are now more quests, more monsters, more weapons, more armor and more areas around town to use to your advantage.</p>\n<p>You now have a farm that sits just outside of town. You'll have access to some mining veins, bug catching spots, a dock for catching fish and a garden. This means that now you can gather materials when you're between missions, which doesn't eliminate the need to gather things while on the hunt, but it does make it less of a hassle. Another extra area is the training school. Here you can partake in hunts with specific limitations; you have a specified item and equipment layout, and have to take on larger prey within a shorter time limit. It's tough to be sure, but it also opens up the ability to produce some very special and powerful new weapons.</p>\n<p>There are some insanely difficult hunts you can take later in the game. As for the new creatures, they run the gamut from having added colors (with new armor options to match) to totally new monsters (like a battle-worn wyvern with a huge mean streak). As an added bonus, not only can you make new types of armor from these new critters, but you can (in some cases) make more armor from classic monsters.</p>\n<p>The controls on the PSP are a little different. While the PSP does lack two shoulder buttons and a second analog stick, players just press two face buttons instead of swinging the right analog stick. Triangle, Circle, and Triangle and Circle combined unleash three different types of attacks, while holding the right shoulder button blocks (or charges to attack if you're using a hammer). Multiplayer is limited to Ad-Hoc, so no going online to form a hunting party.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Sid Meier's Pirates!</em> for the PSP is a mix between the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/15645/sid-meiers-pirates-live-the-life/\">Windows and Xbox</a> version that were released two and three years earlier, respectively. As a straight port, not much has changed except for three really notable elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, the dancing sequences have been tweaked slightly. Now it is up to the player's twitch/reaction time to get the job done right, as opposed to being able to simply watch the governor's daughter's hand motions and body language;</li>\n<li>The second tweak is the addition of being able to physically hunt for treasure. In the Xbox version, the player would find a map, sail to the right spot, and land. Now, similar to the PC version, the player takes four crewman ashore and has to find the red 'X'. All while avoiding booby-traps and vicious jaguars. If the player loses all crew member, it is back to the ship. If the player makes it to the X, then it is time to start digging and rake in the doubloons;</li>\n<li>The third change has been made to the sneaking segments. If the player wants to sneak into a port, it is handled in the exact same way; creeping through the streets, slipping past guards, hiding behind fences, etc. However, the player now moves in a grid, as opposed to being able to move a bit more freely. This does not change gameplay, but it is possible to accidentally step into a guard's line of sight because the player cannot stop moving forward until the character reaches the middle of the next tile;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next to the original game content, the PSP version adds bonus treasure missions, with more plunder and new locations. The game has also been tweaked for widescreen display. Multiplayer is supported for up to four players, through Wi-Fi, Ad Hoc.</p>",

Joe Hartstock through the Normandy campaign.</p>\n<p><em>D-Day</em> can be considered a remix of the first two titles in the series, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/17000/brothers-in-arms-road-to-hill-30/\">Road to Hill 30</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=008888322610\">Earned in Blood</a>, as the levels and combat missions were selected from the first two BIA games, and re-worked for the PSP, in addition to a set of new levels as well. The player can now make use of bazooka teams and fire mortars. Teammates have new abilities, covers can be destroyed, and there are new weapons. A lot of the gameplay is based on coordinating teammates. Tactics are then set out using a birds-eye perspective of the action.</p>\n<p>Multiplayer games through Wi-Fi Ad Hoc either offer 12 skirmish missions or 4 different game modes through the co-op multiplayer campaign.</p>",

It includes 49 exercises in 4 genres of calculation, reflex, judgment, and memory. Mind Quiz was supervised by Dr. Kawashima, the Japanese authority on Functional Brain Imaging.</p>\n<p>It also has online gameplay to play against family and friends, and a mock exam, which evaluates comprehensive strength. By establishing new records, a Healing gallery is opened, with images of animals.</p>",

This part is a standalone story that takes place in the realm of Weltluna, which was once the center of an ancient civilization known as the Water Tribe, and the game closes the <em>Gagharv trilogy</em>. It draws upon a number of the conventions from the previous titles and provides 30-50 hours of gameplay.</p>\n<p>You control Forto, who sets off on an adventure to locate a song left behind by a legendary composer. The game features an improved battle system, which allows you to change party members during battle. While you travel you will meet a variety of characters, of whom six will be able to join your party. The game also features an extra bonus if you have save data from either of the first two Legend of Heroes games on your memory card.</p>\n<p>From time to time, you will come across areas where you can teleport to a special section. There, you can team up with characters from the previous games and go on optional adventures for experience, money, and items - an addition that rewards players who have been following the series from the beginning.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Every Extend Extra</em> is a remake of the popular freeware game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/19495/every-extend/\">Every Extend</a> and in all main aspects of gameplay it sticks to its independent roots. The main difference between E3 and the original game is E3's music adaptation, just like the other <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/50431/tetsuya-mizuguchi/\">Tetsuya Mizuguchi's</a> synesthesia titles (<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/5881/lumines-series/\">Lumines</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5613/rez/\">Rez</a>). E3's main arcade mode allows the player to advance through different stages, each of them featuring different background, enemy designs, music, bosses and a varying pace of play.</p>\n<p>As in the original game you too are unable to shoot. The only way of defense is to detonate your \"ship\" in the vicinity of the enemy. Enemies appear in randomized patterns, and the main goal is to detonate at the right moment and position, to set up a chain reaction of explosions and earning a combo bonus. Blowing oneself up takes away from your overall stock of lives, with a new life being issued at specific amounts of points.</p>\n<p>The original game has been included with the PSP version as well.</p>",

While the original game is a free-roaming <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Grand+Theft+Auto\">GTA</a> clone, the PSP version consists of a series of short missions. It focuses on the shooting sequences of Total Overdose where Ramiro uses his flashiest moves to dispatch mobs and fiends.</p>\n<p>The main story mode, <em>El Gringo Loco</em> is identical to Total Overdose. The player takes on the role of Ramiro Cruz, a young man who has just witnessed his dad's murder in classic Mexican fashion \u00abcombine harvester through office wall\u00bb, and now he is on a gun-fueled quest for vengeance through Mexico. The second single player mode <em>El Macho</em> is a collection of different mini challenges which do not tell any story but give access to different characters with different gameplay. The game also future two dynamic multiplayer modes: <em>Hangman</em> for up to 4 players on 1 console and <em>Fiesta</em> for Wi-Fi gameplay.</p>\n<p>There is a massive amount of exotic weapons and the gameplay is over the top, with bullet-time and gravity-defying moves.</p>",

It also features a wireless mode with support of up to four players.</p>\n<p>In the new Future Mode the game takes place in 13 stages from Pluto to Earth in full 3D. You have to shoot down the mothership, which spawns small invaders over time. This mode supports three viewpoints. In addition to the normal shots there is also Beat Attack accessed by triangle button. If you time your shots with the music using Beat Attack, they will become more powerful. You can also wipe out all aliens on the screen by holding down the triangle button until the fourth beat and then letting go.</p>",

Warring governments try to save lives by using only unmanned aircraft, which means thousands of planes and jets become grounded and useless. On the black market, they fetch high prices as ex-fighter pilots who are now without a job form an underground movement, and race and fight in illegal competitions for fame and fortune.</p>\n<p>By defeating rivals, players can improve their character and unlock new planes and parts to upgrade them with. Multiplayer modes include Arcade Mode (Quick Action), Career Mode (Tournaments), Challenge Mode (five challenges per tier) and Dogfight Mode.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Full Auto 2: Battlelines</em> is the sequel to the auto racing combat game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/23252/full-auto/\">Full Auto</a>, that debuted in February of 2006 on the Xbox 360. </p>\n<p>The PSP version of the sequel builds on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=010086690033\">PS3 version</a> but removes a few features for obvious reasons, resulting in more primitive damage modeling on the cars, less detailed environments and less multiplayer modes. This version does add new gameplay modes, new cars, weapons and a different storyline.</p>\n<p>The game plays much like a mixture of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Burnout\">Burnout</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Twisted+Metal\">Twisted Metal</a>. The PSP version focuses more on the Twisted Metal-style combat gameplay. During most events, winning a race is rarely a goal; the game is focused on destruction. The goals change from level to level, but most time they require eliminating a set number of enemies, or blowing up specific targets, random objects, or oncoming traffic. Unlike the PS3 version every objective needs to be completed to win the event.</p>\n<p>The game contains two general game modes: Racing and Arena. The 'Unwreck' feature is also present and it allows the player to rewind time. The environment is however much less interactive. Most objects cannot be destroyed, only specific ones, for instance a lead pipe that lands on chasing cars. Most destruction is done to store fronts, bus stops, trash cans and other objects.</p>\n<p>The game contains four-player Ad Hoc multiplayer. Players can race or fight in a free-for-all arena or as part of a team in multiplayer modes such as Head-On, Down &amp; Back, as well as Arena Deathmatch.</p>",

It is based on PS2-version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Call+of+Duty+3\">Call of Duty 3</a>, so many mission maps were taken from there though with different objectives and some other changes. </p>\n<p>The game features 14 missions in where you play as an American trooper, a Canadian sniper and a British commando. Depends on a character you play, your Roads to Victory will be different, but ultimately you need to rid France of Nazis. You will retake bunkers, plant bombs, search for documents and deliver them, and use rocket launchers to take out enemy tanks. There is also a mini-shooter game where you can shoot down planes from bomber plane back gun. </p>\n<p>There are four different control schemes and the auto-aiming function. The game supports Ad Hoc multiplayer for 2-6 players and three different modes: Deathmatch, Capture the Flag and King of the Hill. Many bonuses to be unlocked complete the package.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the future, Mankind has developed special androids called A.D.A.Ms (Autonomous Dueling Armed Machine) to fight their wars for them, thus putting an end to centuries of bloodshed. Unfortunately the A.D.A.Ms were a little too effective, and have since completely eliminated the need for war altogether. Not content to just scrap the remaining androids (for some unknown reason), a tower was constructed and used to house the surviving killing machines. Trapped in this tower, the A.D.A.M androids are made to fight each other to the \"death\" much like Roman Gladiators, only without a prize if they win.</p>\n<p>The core gameplay of Rengoku 2 is pure action. Your A.D.A.M begins with nothing but his fists to fight off the other androids in the tower. As you defeat your enemies, they sometimes drop Elixer Skins (which can be used to upgrade your health, defense and more) or weapons. Once you've gathered a few weapons you can go back to a terminal (the hub at the beginning of every floor of the tower) and equip them. Weapons can be equipped on the arms, the head or the torso, and certain weapons can be used in multiple places (i.e. the Auto Crossbow can be equipped on your head and/or your arms but not your torso). Each section of the body is assigned a face-button (Square - Left Arm, Circle - Right Arm, X - Torso and Triangle - Head). This can lead to some nasty combos if you link your weapon attacks together. By racking up big combos as your opponent dies (this is called \"Overkill\"), you can increase the chance that they'll drop more Elixer Skins or that Flamethrower you saw them using a few seconds before you back-flipped to a safe distance and hit them with a barrage of homing missiles.</p>\n<p>The game's pacing is also as straight-forward as its gameplay. You clear the current floor of enemies (gathering weapons and upgrading along the way), fight the floor boss, then move up to the next floor to do it again. As you progress through the tower, your enemies begin using more powerful weapons, which you can take for yourself of course, and even start to attack you in groups.</p>\n<p>There is also a multiplayer mode which uses the game-sharing feature so you can actually upload a demo to your friend's PSP if they don't own the game themselves. Multiplayer is a straight deathmatch affair. Each player begins with nothing, finding weapons and support items in the environment or inside destructible crates. The pickups all look the same, so there's no way of knowing what you're about to pick up until you actually take it, which adds a  bit of random, on the fly strategy to the multiplayer.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Driver '76</em> is the fifth game in the Driver series and the first since <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Ubisoft\">Ubisoft</a> acquired the license from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Atari\">Atari</a>. The game is a prequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/21660/driver-parallel-lines/\">Driver: Parallel Lines</a>, set two years before the events, and features two side characters from Parallel Lines: Ray (controlled by the player) and Slink. Ray has set his eyes on the daughter of a Triad boss and tries to impress him by taking on tough jobs. This gets him in a lot of trouble with the other gangs, and the story, divided over 6 chapters, is presented in comic-book style.</p>\n<p>There are 27 missions, set in New York, from New Jersey to Coney Island, with several distinguishable districts, and over 40 customizable vehicles, from dirt bikes to sports cars and big rigs, and some surprises such as the Ghostbusters' Ecto-1 - all with different handling. Players have complete freedom to move about, but the mission structure is linear. Tasks include time-limited runs, escorting and evading missions. Ray can also move on foot, and wreak havoc with a number of guns, along with locked targetting.</p>\n<p>During the main game the characters can accept side jobs to earn additional cash, such as closed-course or open-road racing, driving a tow-truck, a taxi or an ambulance, and money can be spend in the garage to upgrade the vehicles.</p>\n<p>Multiplayer is supported for up to 2 players over WiFi with Street Racing, Carnage, Circuit Racing, Pink Slip Racing and Swap Meet. Players can also swap items over W-Lan or download new paint jobs. Next to the main game, there are also a few minigames.</p>",

Saphira can attack, brake, reverse course and use boost to cross long distances. The main means of attack are her talons, used to grab enemies or larger objects to bomb everything on the ground below. There is also a selection of offensive and defensive spells. Health is replenished by eating livestock.</p>\n<p>There are 6 arena levels unlocked by playing through the singleplayer campaign. These are multiplayer stages where you can fight versus as many as three bots or human players in 12 different game modes. The PSP version is completely different game than those for the other platforms, focusing only on Saphira the dragon while the others prominently feature the hero Eragon.</p>",

DJ in an attempt to find his friends that have been taken by the evil necromancer Moloch. DJ's friends' souls appear as puzzle pieces throughout the game which you must find to bring them back.</p>\n<p>Warp through 17 levels fighting demons and fiends using DJ's famed scythe along with other weapons like a shotgun, electric gun and even C4 Hamsters. Use DJ's scythe to not only maim and kill but to reach heights not accessible by jumping. Upgrade weapons and learn new moves (scythe combos) by collecting widgets scattered throughout the levels. The ability to destroy the environment is an advantage to DJ as the more successful hits with his scythe be it animate or inanimate his combo meter will rise allowing DJ's friend Pandora to assist in the fight.</p>\n<p>Death Jr.'s camera is free roaming and follows DJ around with the ability to snap to the position DJ is looking at the press of a button. You can also free look with the press of a button and lock on to enemies and strafe while shooting with a gun. At the end of each level you receive a report card that tells you your number of kills, how much destruction you caused, the total number of combo points, special items discovered and your final grade.</p>",

The focus is on a humorous plot and combo-based zombie killing.</p>\n<p>It's Christmas time in New York and Zombies have come to ruin the festivities. As New York Cop Agent Stevens, you find out that not only are you immune to the zombie virus, but your blood is actually so powerful, it will make a zombie explode.</p>\n<p>The main focus of the gameplay is shooting holes in the zombies until they are weak enough for you to fire a vial of your own blood into them, causing an explosion. Weaken enough zombies, fire a blood vial into one, and watch the chain reaction as exploding zombies send your anti-zombie blood onto other zombies.</p>\n<p>The game was one of the first online PSP games, and featured a mode where defeating an opponent would give them your virus, and force their avatar online to look like your avatar. If they in turn defeated someone, your virus would be passed onto them as well. At any time you could look at a world map to see where on earth your strain of virus had travelled.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Hot Pixel</em> is a casual game happening in a pixellized universe mixed from street culture, digital lifestyle and old-school style video games. It consists of 200 micro games, randomly selected from the pool in one mode, or grouped together into 10 episodes in a second mode, linked together by cut-scenes featuring the teenager DJON.</p>\n<p>Each micro game lasts only a few seconds, similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/3512/warioware-series/\">WarioWare games</a>. During this short time limit, the player has to work out what he is supposed to do aided by a short sentence that appears when the game starts. There are also a number of tutorials and training modes. After clearing a set number of micro games the player is presented with a longer \"boss\" micro game which is generally more challenging in order to clear the level. Some of the games have suggestive themes or crude content.</p>\n<p>By going through the games, new ones are unlocked or presented with different modes, such as the removal of the time limit. Other features include a rating mode for the different characters, music jukebox, a list of unlocked video segments, and playlists to compile a list of favourite games or share it through the internet or memory sticks. The playlists come with 3 modes: Challenge (play through a selection), Survive (try to keep playing for a set amount of time) and Freeplay. There is an Ad Hoc multiplayer mode to compete against a friend for the best score. Playing well fills a gauge. When maxed out, it can be used to send a \"disturber\" that modifies the opponent's screen display.</p>\n<p>Some of the micro games use concepts of popular games such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Battlezone\">Battlezone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Breakout\">Breakout</a>. Additional games can be downloaded from the developer's website and are imported via a memory stick.</p>",

Pressure Plays are essentially challenges requiring the player to complete a given task within certain defined parameters. Early Pressure Plays involve bowling no extras, or playing block shots. Later Pressure Plays involve famous run chases, holding out for rain, and hitting six sixes off an over.</p>\n<p>The game supports ad-hoc PSP multiplayer for 2 players, but does not support game sharing. Additionally, the game focuses exclusively on one-day internationals, with no option to play tests, 20-20s, or county cricket.</p>",

The remake features 3D graphics, though the gameplay is largely identical to the 2D platform style of the original. It also adds a Boss Rush mode that unlocks a minigame when completed three times.</p>\n<p>The original version of the game as well as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Castlevania:+Symphony+of+the+Night\">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a> are included as unlockable content. This version of <em>Symphony of the Night</em> allows the player to control Maria as the protagonist (like in the earlier Saturn version) and also has new sound effects and voice acting. This version of <em>Symphony of the Night</em> sticks closer to the Japanese PlayStation release of the game as it still lacks the Saturn exclusive areas.</p>",

Now, some rogue demons have escaped from hell and Mephisto needs to to destroy them before they cause him trouble. If you don't, he'll take your girlfriend back to hell with him.</p>\n<p>Ghost Rider attacks with his flaming hellfire chains in a manner similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=God+of+War\">God of War</a>. If he uses a variety of moves and avoids being hit, it fills a vengeance bar. The more this meter fills, the more souls he gets from enemies he kills. Souls are used to purchase new moves and extras like additional characters. There are some shielded enemies where you must have a minimum vengeance bar to damage them. There is also a spirit gauge, which is essentially a special meter and is also built up by attacking. It allows the uses of special moves, like your shotgun.</p>\n<p>There are also Hellcycle levels, where you must successfully avoid obstacles while destroying enemies with the bike's hellshots attacks and your chains. This version of the game additionally includes a challenge mode which is based on the Hellcycle levels with rule variations: elimination and survival (every racer has a depleting life bar which can be only refilled by driving through checkpoints).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ultimate Racing</em> is the first game in the series of Hot Wheels licensees to appear on the PSP platform. Just like the other games, it is a straightforward racing game with a focus on arcade gameplay. The game offers three game modes:<em> </em>Ultimate Challenge*: win races to unlock new cars, tracks, challenges and performance upgrades.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Arcade Mode</em>: quick play based on the unlocked content from the Ultimate Challenge mode.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Multiplayer Mode</em>: quick races or checkpoint-based races for up to four players</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In Ultimate Challenge, there are six main stages to choose from, with eleven tracks and twenty licensed cars in total. The game starts from a central warehouse where all unlocked cars are stored. These can be upgraded or customized in the garage. Next to the performance upgrades, players can tweak the colors of the body, glass, neon, wheels, and change the wheels and decals.</p>\n<p>The Arcade Mode is further divided into different challenges: Quick Race, Survival Mode (complete a series of increasingly difficult races and avoid being kicked out), Collector (checkpoint-based races) and Time Trial.</p>\n<p>Next to regular racing controls such as brakes and acceleration, players can also use NOS (boost) and Slow Motion (slow down time during difficult sections). The use is limited as it depletes a reserve. It can be refilled by passing by obstacles without hitting them or completing tricky jumps. Tracks, with themes such as Volcano, Jungle or Death Valley, are generally filled with obstacles, moving objects or animals. The focus is entirely on racing, there are no weapons or other offensive means and the cars can only be slowed down, unable to sustain damage.</p>\n<p>There are three different camera settings and ghost cars are supported during time trials.</p>",

This game is not a direct port from PlayStation 2 release. New features have been added while others were removed to make the game appropriate for its new portable form. For example, there are item boxes used as global deposits allowing to store items and access them any time without entering \"home\".</p>\n<p>The game features most elements from its predecessor, and you still need to fulfil missions - hunt monsters, gather materials and use them to create better equipment. Unlike the original game in <em>Monster Hunter Freedom 2</em> all missions can be finished solo. The game world has also been expanded and now includes more unique territories for players to explore.</p>\n<p>Multiplayer is still limited to Ad-Hoc, but the game features online downloadable quests which often provide special materials that can create bonus equipment impossible to create otherwise.</p>",

As an officer in a Chinese army (Wei, Wu or Shu armies), you fight and kill thousands of soldiers in massive battles stretched over numerous battlefields - either in the campaign \"Musou\" modes or the single battle \"Free\" mode which can be used to train.</p>\n<p>Each stage consists of a map split in numerous areas. From the map, the player selects an area he has access to (areas are connected to each other in certain directions, and the player can only move to an area connected to the one he his currently in); if the area has enemy units, a battle field similar to the ones in the main <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/854/dynasty-warriors-series/\">Dynasty Warriors</a> games, albeit smaller, will load. In each areas, the enemy squads must be eliminated for the area to be liberated. When such an area is under enemy control, bonuses such as supplies that increase the remaining time to complete the stage, are acquired. As characters defeats enemies, they gain experience points and level-up. </p>\n<p>New to this PSP version is a bodyguard system where your selected second officer can give you certain items or abilities, for example one ensures you always have a horse when entering an area, and others can give you special powered up Musou attacks.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Set six years before the 1997 PSX game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Final+Fantasy+VII\">Final Fantasy VII</a>, the prequel <em>Crisis Core</em> follows the adventures of Zack Fair as he discovers the truth of the organisation he works for, Shin-Ra. At the time, Cloud Strife is still a Shinra Guard and Aerith Gainsborough also makes an appearance. Other prominent figures are Sephiroth, Tifa, Yuffie, Cait Sith, members of the Turks gang and also characters from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/24037/dirge-of-cerberus-final-fantasy-vii/\">Dirge of Cerberus</a>.</p>\n<p>The game is played as an action RPG and the events are mainly set around the city of Nibelheim. The turn-based battle system, DMV or Digital Mind Wave, is entirely new. It is based on reels with the portraits of the characters spinning in the top left corner. Lining up the same character in all reels is awarded with a power-up (Power Surge). Attacks are both physical and spell-based, and materia also makes a return. There are different varieties, both defensive and offensive, and different materia can also be fused together.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Fading Shadows</em> is a unique puzzle game for the PSP where the player leads an orb through 40 different levels by controlling a beam of light. This beam acts like a magnet to attract the orb, and can be widened or narrowed for different effects. The orb can be changed into 3 different states: metal, wood and glass. In order to solve complex puzzles and overcome obstacles, the player must utilize all the different transformations of the orb and master control over the beam of light.</p>\n<p>The game story revolves around a young boy named Erwyn, who has been captured and imprisoned by the evil Master Gardal. The boy's soul is pure and untainted, and if Gardal sacrifices Erwyn then Gardal may breach the gates of the Castle of Heaven - a fortress built to protect the world from dark forces. However, Erwyn's clairvoyant sister has sealed his soul within a protective orb, and it is her job to free the orb from captivity and guide it safely to the Castle of Heaven.</p>",

As such, the player drives through snow, sleet, sand, mud, water and gravel. Track deformation technology ensures that no two laps are ever the same, as grooves are impacted into the ground and snow is moved off the primary racing line.</p>\n<p>Game modes include Quick Race, Championship, Time Attack and Online multiplayer.

        "description": "<p><em>Innocent Life: A Futuristic Harvest Moon</em> is a new generation of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6585/harvest-moon/\">Harvest Moon</a> series. Unlike all previous games the only thing the player is able to choose when starting the game is the name of the main character. The game takes place in the year of 2022 on a small island located in the southern hemisphere. The player is not cast as human teenager as in previous games, but as a brand new robot - created by Dr. Hopes from in Volcano Town. This time it is not possible to marry for instance. The main goal is to save the island from destruction by angry spirits of nature. To do so, the robot will learn how to develop more human characteristics.</p>\n<p>Much has changed in terms of how the game plays out compared to other entries in the series. Many of these changes are improvements as well as fixes to over-exploited tricks in the previous titles. One of the major improvements to game is the ability to walk through crops that have been planted. Seeds are now planted in 1x1 squares as opposed to the old 9x9 method of planting. Seeds are now also purchased in individual numbers as opposed to bags of 9. Crops and flowers are no longer destroyed if players accidentally drop them on the ground for some time. Things grown in the wild cannot longer be exploited. Instead a special \u201cScale Pack\u201d is required to harvest them and only 3kg can be carried at all times.</p>\n<p>Crops grown in the wild are no longer available every single day of the season. Like in real life they now have specific \u201cregrowth\u201d periods as well as specific schedules on which the fruits or other things are fully grown and able to be harvested. Time no longer stops when inside a farm, but it stops when other people's houses are entered. The entire field is no longer available right at the start of the game. It needs to be increased by unlocking the seals on it. Gems to unlock them come from the story quests and the exploration of caves. The time hierarchy has also been changed. Players can now choose to get up earlier than usual, but only if the character goes to sleep before 21:00 (11:00 PM).</p>",

Not only can the player choose to control a squad of US Navy Seals, but the player can alternatively decide to control one of several foreign units that have roles comparable to the SEALS, such as the Dutch KCT, German KSK, Australian SASR, the Italian 9th Parachute Assault Regiment, the Spanish UOE, the British SAS, the French GIGN or the South Korean 707th Special Mission Unit.</p>\n<p>The story takes place in Panama, as the players national ambassador and the Panamanian ambassador are seized by a local group of rebel narcotrafficante kidnappers, referred to as \"La Mano Los Gente\" -- though it is worth noting that this is egregiously ungrammatical Spanish, since it would translate literally as \"The Hand The People,\" because the \"de\" is missing! The fictional group of criminals, with their comical name, hold the pair for ransom and it is up to the player to conduct an increasingly complex and difficult operation in order to rescue the two diplomats.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is different from other SOCOM games, in that there remains a squad of four men to control, but instead of bringing up a menu interface and then pointing the cursor to a certain location to give an order, this new game features a locator box that is moved along the surface of the ground. This lets the player choose a specific target location or rally point as the case may be, and then to use a certain button to instruct soldiers to take cover, establish crossfire, defend, ambush, etc. One can, of course, order them to use particular weapons such as close combat knives, rifles, satchel charges for demolition, pistols, a shot fired by the squad's sniper, or thrown grenades. When choosing an aimpoint to throw a grenade, a dynamically adjustable moving arc appears, to show what trajectory it will follow.</p>\n<p>There are nine different non-linear missions to play, with the option of two instant action missions for each stage, and the story is told with pre-rendered cut-scenes.</p>",

However, Bolt is not alone. She gets help from the Tokobots, a bunch a mechanized men who help Bolt out by forming certain objects such as bridges and ladders to avoid pitfalls and help move objects as well.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5674/pikmin/\">Pikmin</a> for the Gamecube, the player controls the Tokobots by highlighting them and sending them to certain areas and complete certain tasks. The game will start you out with six, but as the levels progress, more Tokobots will be available, the more that can be obtained, the more bigger and powerful machines that can be used. Likewise, the puzzles get harder as the game progresses as well.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Cube</em> is a puzzle game with action elements. The game is set in a cubic world with different stages and challenges. Players control a cube through tracks that act like 3D platforms and mazes. There are 135 levels based on nine themes in total. The different themes (called zones in the game) come with their own contraptions and a specific colour. Dangers include bombs, creatures, sinking surfaces, rotating blocks, blocks that blow the cube backwards and more. Sometimes these also need to be manipulated to create new paths (e.g. moving blocks and then luring a bomb to blow it up).</p>\n<p>The cube is \"sticky\" and as such it is able to roll to the sides of the bottom of a track to approach an area from a different direction or to collect new items. Only special squares cannot be moved over. The camera can also be rotated around the cube to view the environment before moving. Certain levels are time limited. The game includes a level editor and new levels can be stored and shared with friends. Multiplayer is available over Wi-Fi with the modes Battle, Co-Op, Collect and Race. While progressing players can unlock new music tracks.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Hellboy: The Science of Evil</em> is the second game adaptation of Mike Mignola's popular comic book character (now also featured in films and an animated series). The story is unique to the game, and sees Hellboy travel through six different settings as he tracks down the evil Von Klempt. Hellboy faces his familiar enemies including various demons and Nazi creations. The game features brawler style action, with some puzzle and story elements interspersed throughout.</p>\n<p>In <em>The Science of Evil</em>, Hellboy has several abilities that set him apart from the standard brawler character, including the ability to pick up and wield many environmental objects such as barrels and debris from structures knocked down with his Right Hand of Doom. He can also grapple enemies to finish them off one-on-one, or use them as projectiles.</p>\n<p>Team up with a friend and attempt six co-op multiplayer levels over ad-hoc WiFi. These levels are derived from the single-player campaign, but have been shortened and re-worked to provide a set of two-player puzzles. Scores are tracked individually - so it doesn't have to be completely co-operative.</p>\n<p><em>Hellboy: The Science of Evil</em> was also released on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, however the PSP version is not a port of that game. The story elements and characters are similar, but the PSP features a unique combat system, different AI and a new level layout more suited to the handheld environment.</p>",

The game can be considered a slimmed down version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/171700/mlb-2006/\">MLB 2006</a>. It has the standard game modes, Quick Game, Season Mode as well as a Multiplayer mode where two players can compete against each other using the Ad Hoc.</p>\n<p>Some of the new gameplay mechanics for the game areRelease Point Pitching with Confidence meter which would determine the success rate of the pitcher depending on the stats and skill of the player. The more successful pitches made within a certain zone, the easier the pitches become, missing them cause wild pitches or pitch a line drive right to the batter.</p>\n<p>Another is the Playmaker Fielding Marker, where unlike other games this one used the players stats to determine if regular plays like pop-ups would be considered easy by giving the player ample opportunity by showing the landing location faster and giving it a more wider area. Less skilled players would be given less of a warning and a smaller catching radius, making even the simplest plays more challenging.</p>\n<p>The Branch Point Technology introduced a seamless flow of transition for the game that allowed the player to plan out the direction of a throw while still in the process of catching it and was also used for baserunning that gave it a smoother feel to running and sliding.</p>",

Just like the earlier ones it is an action based flying game, shown from a third-person perspective. Familiar characteristics are the fast pace, taking on many enemies at once with a combination of hit-scan and lock-on weapons, and evasive manoeuvres through rolls.</p>\n<p>The game consists of 24 levels. Players choose from three pilots (Billy Blaze, Harrison Duke and Tomiko Rossellini) to go after the terrorist cell Black Falcon that has stolen thirteen prototype planes. Each pilot brings along different plot twists and there are nineteen different planes to fly (mostly jets). They can be equipped with weapons and items, or be given a paint job. The game takes place on locations all over the world and while flying there are often short sequences by the pilots. There are also many objects in the scenery that need to be avoided or destroyed. Missions have main objectives and side missions that brings along more money for upgrades. As usual, there are large bosses that wield weapons such as EMP.</p>\n<p>Multiplayer is supported for eight players, in competitive modes and a two-player cooperative mode.</p>",

A young French girl from the village of Domremy trying to assist her father with his daily labors discovers a mysterious object: an armlet that binds magically on her wrist. Soon the village is being attacked and finding the first sword she can, she steps forth to encounter the enemy, some humanoid beasts. Taking strength from the armlet, hearing a mysterious voice and having for assistance her close friends, she manages to defeat them and embarks on a long quest to help her countrymen and vanquish the evil forces invading France.</p>\n<p><em>Jeanne d'Arc</em> is a turn-based strategy RPG game of the Japanese variety, that fuses medieval history with fantasy and the craziness of Japanese anime. This is a well known story retold through tactical battles one after another, while game dialog along with hand drawn cutscenes twist the story into different territories from the original. </p>\n<p>It is a story of teen friendship and dedication, remorseless war, evil magic, unavoidable death, heartache abandonment and purifying hope. Jeanne joins the army and along with 14 other companions with different skills and personalities march to face England's Henry VI's troops. With her are other armlet wielders, able to use them and transform into fearsome warriors able to strike down evil at its core. The game features a map to move through locations where the battles which push the story forward happen along with free stages that add nothing more than fun, strong items and difficult bosses.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Cabela's Dangerous Hunts: Ultimate Challenge</em> is largely a conversion of the 2003 console game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=047875750159\">Cabela's Dangerous Hunt</a> with a few control options to make it more accessible for a hand-held device.</p>\n<p>As a hunting simulator, it is largely action oriented. In the main story mode the player needs to rescue an old friend who has gone missing. Before that, several short missions in different environments need to be played, ranging from forest to open fields and snowy landscapes. Players are usually accompanied by an AI character with short cut-scenes that advance the story. Most missions require the player to explore the terrain, getting past obstacles (e.g. swimming through a river when a bridge breaks down) and shooting every animal that comes in sight.</p>\n<p>Shown from a first-person perspective, players can move and look around freely, strafe, aim, zoom and slow down time for a moment to get a better shot. Targets are highlighted in red when the cursor passes over them. The arsenal includes everything from small handguns to heavy rifles. They have limited ammo and need to be reloaded regularly. On the terrain additional ammunition and medikits can be found. When animals attack or get too close, there is a secondary attack where the player uses his weapon to push animals away. The species include rabbits, lions, wolves, bears and more.</p>\n<p>Next to the main Story mode, Quick Action offers short games in different settings. From a fixed position, players need to take out animals or practice targets with a limited amount of time. In one of these even dinosaurs get hunted from inside a helicopter.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem</em> is based on the movie of the same name and continues <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Aliens+Vs+Predator\">the mix</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Alien(s)+games\">Aliens</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Predator\">Predator</a> franchises. The basic premise of the movie is followed. Picking up where the original film left off, a group of predators travels back to the homeworld with a <em>predalien</em>, a survivor impregnated with an alien embryo. In a struggle to kill the creature that possesses the strengths and weaknesses of both species, the ship crashes on earth. A father and a son who investigate the vessel are impregnated by facehuggers allowing the aliens to continue their colonization of the planet. When a lone predator scout discovers the ship has crashed, he travels to earth to rid it of the intruders.</p>\n<p>Players take control of the predator from a third-person perspective. While the humans and aliens are fighting, his main task is to dissolve and disintegrate all evidence of extraterrestrial life. During the course of the game, the aliens are the main enemies, but humans will also engage the predator when he is sighted. The predator can activate a cloak, but this drains energy so it needs to be recharged every now and then by returning to the normal mode. The cloak automatically disappears when in contact with water. He also has three vision modes (tech, thermal and alien) to get a better look of the environment. Enemies can be locked to make it easier to track them while they are moving.</p>\n<p>The shoulder buttons control the camera while the analogue stick is used to run around. Next to basic wrist attacks he also has additional weapons such as a shoulder cannon, hand cannon and a disc that can be thrown. The available weapons can be selected before starting a mission. These can be upgraded after completing missions. He can also zoom in (switching to a first-person mode) and tag aliens to earn honour points. These can be used to upgrade weapons and are also awarded when no humans are killed. Basic movement includes jumping, breaking through walls, climbing and shaking off aliens when pinned down as well. To progress, a certain amount of evidence usually needs to be removed first. The game offers branched missions paths with entirely different settings. While playing, a map can be activated to shown the environment, enemies and objectives.</p>\n<p>Next to the main storyline, there are skirmish matches that can be played with two players cooperatively as well.</p>",

Once again the player takes command of either The Rebellion, The Galactic Empire, The Republic Clone Army and The CIS Droid Army, with a variety of heroes for each side such as Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Han Solo as well as villains like Boba Fett, Darth Maul and Darth Vader among many others.</p>\n<p>It features the same modes as in its predecessors: <em>Galactic Conquest</em> where the player chooses which team they want to play as, fighting against their respective enemies on a massive battlefield. The winner of said battle will get to choose witch planet to attack next with the game ending once the home planet of either side is taken by their enemies.</p>\n<p>The <em>Campaign mode</em> is told through the perspective at the end of the <em>Star Wars Saga</em> where a young Jedi uncovers the untold history of the <em>Renegade Squadron</em> which is formed after the battle of Yavin IV by none other than Han Solo. The player experiences these battles by playing as soldiers of the Rebellion plus commanders of the rebels like Han Solo and Leia Organa, completing certain tasks for each missions in order to advance. The story is told through comic book style cutscenes with voice overs.</p>\n<p>Unlike the previous games, the class system has been redone where players can customize their own soldiers by selecting which weapons they choose to have before a battle. Space battles return for this version as well, with the ability to take command of famous ships like the <em>The Millennium Falcon</em>, Tie-Fighters and Star Destroyers.</p>\n<p>There is also online capabilities that can support 16 players through Infrastructure and eight players through ad-hoc with a special spending system implemented to purchase custom kits as well as create new characters from scratch.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Finder Love: Aki Hoshino</em> is one of the three Finder Love games that were released simultaneously, each of them starring a different Japanese idol. This edition is entirely about the Japanese bikini idol Aki Hoshino and it is largely a dating sim.</p>\n<p>Played from a first-person perspective, the player is an amateur photographer. Aki catches the protagonist's eye as soon as she enters the hotel and after striking up a conversation the main goal of the game is to keep her entertained and follow her on different locations to take pictures.</p>\n<p>Aki Hoshino is visible through photos shown against different backgrounds in slideshows as well as FMV sequences. There are also various voice fragments. The main story is continued through conversations where the player is given a few basic options every now and then. The photography itself is a rhythm game where the player needs to use the shoulder buttons to catch hearts to build up combos and take photographs at the most ideal moment while video footage runs behind a transparent hud. When time is up, the player's performance is graded. With an A or a B grade, extra shutter time is provided and the game will continue for a few more seconds.</p>\n<p>The photos are collected in albums and can be traded with friends. There are also other mini-games set in a restaurant, an attack game where Aki will punch the protagonist and he needs to block her hits, Sharades, Paper Rock Scissors, the Cute Maze and a compatibility test. This eventually leads to four different endings. Although Aki wears somewhat revealing outfits, there is no adult content or explicit nudity in the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p>An evil magician crashes a teenagers' party, uses his powers to load all their cars on his trailer and transform them into miniature cars themselves. The friends Hannah, Claire, Vicky, Roger and Mitch need to free themselves by racing pocket cars on tracks, where winning races is awarded with soul gems and soul shards that can return them to their human form.</p>\n<p>Races are grouped together in different soul challenges with identical gameplay but different settings such as a garden or a bathroom. Since the cars are very small, the roads are loaded with huge items such as bottles and everyday appliances. The tracks have short-cuts, jumps and slopes, as well power-ups that destroy the environment, provide rockets or freeze the opponent's car. There are four camera perspectives (all third-person) and a button to reset the car when straying away from the track.</p>\n<p>Next to the soul races there are time trial and practice modes. The car park has many vehicle models with different statistics, liveries and decals. Most of these still need to be unlocked at the start of the game. Aside from single-player games, there are online play modes with game modes as race, soccer, and domination.</p>",

The LocoRoco love to sing, but now the Moja have learned a song of their own - one so dreadful that it is able to suck out the life of all living things! The player must control the planet once more to not only protect the LocoRoco, but protect the entire planet itself!</p>\n<p><em>LocoRoco 2</em> is a sequel to the PSP game, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=711719866220\">LocoRoco</a>. As with the original game, the player controls the planet, and tilts it by using the L and R Buttons on the PSP. By pressing both L and R simultaneously, the planet gives a shake and makes the LocoRoco jump. Tapping the Circle button scares the LocoRoco, making them split apart into smaller ones and allowing them to squeeze through gaps. Holding Circle merges them back into one large LocoRoco again.</p>\n<p>As players explore the LocoRoco's world, they will encounter places poisoned by the Moja's awful singing. By hitting the black blobby areas with the LocoRoco, the poison will break off and restore the area to normal. Players can destroy Mojas themselves in the same way. As the LocoRoco explore the levels, they will discover musical notes - collecting enough of these will give the player bonus help in exploring the levels. Occasionally, players will encounter brief mini-games where they must tap the beat to the LocoRoco's songs to earn even more musical notes.</p>\n<p>New to <em>LocoRoco 2</em> is Loco Rider - this mini-game can be played wirelessly with up to four players in ad-hoc mode. The aim is to push the opponents into the thorns using your LocoRoco to shrink theirs before they do the same to you!</p>",

This title was released to coincide with the release of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/37562/midnight-club-los-angeles/\">Midnight Club: Los Angeles</a> for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It provides a similarly themed Los Angeles street racing experience using the tried and tested Midnight Club formula. The graphics have been improved since the last PSP offering with some new racing modes thrown into the mix. </p>\n<p>Midnight Club: L.A. Remix has left the strict race route format in favour of open-world exploration. It passes through realistic day and night cycles meaning that races are no longer performed only at midnight. A variety of cars and motorcycles are on offer as the game progresses and dynamic weather alters vehicle performance. Damage modelling has been added and careless drivers soon find the performance of their car degraded and face large repair fees at the end of the race.</p>",

In this classic shooter, the player's mission is to destroy everything that comes against him on the screen. Enemies are mainly asteroids but also other spaceships and mines. Because the game has been reworked for PSP, there is no planet in the background and the wireless multiplayer mode is not available. Controls on the left side moves the ship and right sides four buttons controls firing. Super Stardust Portable also introduces a new game mode called Impact, where the player can only use bombs and boost. Also, the game's end boss has been changed to be more difficult.</p>",

Season mode allows the player to take part in a complete season with one 'real-life' rider, or alternatively to compete over multiple seasons with a fictional rider, with the ability to move teams at the end of the season depending on the performance during the season. Different levels of difficulty relating to the realism of the bikes handling and performance are offered to cater for both novice and more experienced players.

The player takes on the role of special agent Jacob Grant and enters a virtual reality combat simulation program called A.I.D.A to stabilise it and enable its proper use. After the simulation program previously spread through earth's networks and ran loose, humans had to risk their lives by digitizing their personality, for a chance to hack inside the system and bring back the valuable data inside, guarded by enemies from the military program that was no longer in use. Now that it is contained again, while experimenting Jacob discovers that the program is still not stable.</p>\n<p>Like its predecessor, <em>Coded Arms: Contagion</em> is a first-person shooter and it offers over a dozen different weapons that can be upgraded using plug-ins. It is also possible to hack into turrets (by picking they identical number from two lines of data) and turning them against their masters. There are thirteen missions in total. Multiplayer is available on five different maps for up to eight players, supporting both Ad Hoc and Infrastructure.</p>",

The first title in the series, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=jet-de-go\">Jet de GO!</a>, was released on PlayStation in 2000 and its sequel, simply titled \"Jet de GO! 2\", was released on PlayStation 2 in 2002. </p>\n<p>Just like its predecessors, the game allows the player to take the captain's chair in the cockpit of a commercial airliner making flights to and from major Japanese cities such as Tokyo, Osaka and Sapporo. The game features a variety of airplanes such as the Boeing B747, B777 and B767, different weather and daytime conditions and flight plans. The player can choose between three game modes: Flight, Trial and Replay.</p>\n<p>Since the game is endorsed by Japan Airlines, a real world airline, it is not actually possible to \"crash\" an airplane. Collisions with the ground are shown in a simplified fashion where the plane simply stops once it touches down, resulting in a \"Game Over\" screen.</p>\n<p>Although the game was only released in Japan, it features partially English menus.</p>",

The player is James Grayson, a former British Marine. Grayson finds his brother infected by the Chimera virus and goes on to destroy every conversion centre he can find. The Maquis enlist Grayson, and it's his job to retake Europe from the Chimera. The game is presented as a third-person shooter and makes use of a cover system that allows the player to hide behind objects. While hiding from Chimera, Grayson is able to pop out quickly and attack the enemy. Covers are locked automatically when Grayson goes near them and aiming assistance is also provided.</p>\n<p>Players who own a copy of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/39157/resistance-2/\">Resistance 2</a> and play <em>Resistance: Retribution</em> on a PSP 2000 or 3000 can connect the AV output to a television to play the game with a DualShock 3 controller. Also when owning both games, they can be linked using a USB cable to open up the Infected mode. It provides an alternate history, mixing events of the two games. Grayson is recruited by Specter Lieutenant David LaSalle (from <em>Resistance 2</em>) and is infected with a mutated version of the Chimeran virus. In this game mode, Grayson wears a Specter uniform and has glowing Chimeran eyes. He can regenerate health, gets access to new weapons and breathes underwater. He is also able to reach hidden passages and pick up intel, unlocking plasma grenades and even a further expanded story. This game mode ends when the game is quit and progress cannot be saved.</p>\n<p>Multiplayer consists of battles through Ad Hoc and Infrastructure with statistics tracking on MyResistance.net. The included game modes are deathmatch, team deathmatch, containment, capture the flag and assimilation.</p>",

Released about a year after its predecessor, the changes and additions in <em>Ridge Racer 2</em> include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new opening and ending CGI movie.</li>\n<li>Many new tracks and songs from previous Ridge Racer games.</li>\n<li>New SPECIAL class cars to challenge in duels and win.</li>\n<li>Survival mode: In a four car race, after each round, the car to be in last place is eliminated from the pack.</li>\n<li>Duel mode: A race against a single AI car.</li>\n<li>Single Race mode has been replaced with an Arcade mode in which the player races not only against the pack of 11 cars but also has to reach checkpoints on the track to stay in the game. The options menu features a new setting to adjust the difficulty of Arcade mode.</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p><em>Pilot Academy</em> is a flight simulator on the PSP which encompasses all eras of flight, ranging from historic WWI fighter planes such as the famous Fokker Triplane (flown by the \"Red Baron\" Manfred von Richthofen) to modern military and civilian jet aircraft like the F-15, F-16 and Boeing 747. All aircraft names and designs are licensed.</p>\n<p>In the initial lessons, the game teaches the player the basics of powered flight for both civilian and military purposes. The game uses all PSP buttons to deliver a flight simulation feel with the analog nub serving as a joystick. Controlling the flaps, air brakes, raising and lowering the landing gear as well as using the tail rudder are also possible. Military aircraft feature air-to-ground missiles, air-to-air-missiles, a machine gun and flares for self defense against missiles. The only thing missing from the simulation is a fuel gauge, but since most missions are rather short, this was probably a deliberate design choice. </p>\n<p>After civilian and military flight lessons are completed, the player is free to choose from various missions and challenges. Completing a task successfully unlocks new aircraft in the player's hangar which can then be flown any time in free flight mode (but only on the tropical map). Distinctions are also awarded for completion of a mission based on time taken, aircraft integrity, completion of objectives and level of excitement/comfort of passengers (if any) and determine the level of proficiency of the player pilot.</p>\n<p>Flights take place over different types of terrain including tropical, desert, snow covered mountains and canyons and in varying weather conditions like rain, snow and even in a storm. Some missions begin while already airborne, while others require the player to taxi onto the runway, takeoff and land after completing the objective. </p>\n<p>Multiplayer supports up to four players dogfighting against each other or cooperatively with planes from any of the four military eras, e.g. a dogfight between a WWII propeller plane like the P-51 Mustang or the Spitfire versus an F-14 Tomcat or F-16 Falcon is possible.</p>",

The game features over 200 seemingly historically accurate missions in 13 campaigns. The player can choose between the US Army Air Force, the Royal Air Force, the Luftwaffe or the Red Army Air Force. There are 17 WWII-era planes to fly with in the game.</p>\n<p>The missions consist of patrols, manoeuvres, strategic bombing, air support, air superiority, interdiction, paratroops and supply deployment and prevent bombing missions. Each mission lasts about 5-10 minutes so the game is pretty easy to play while commuting, for example. Most of the missions are either dogfight missions, bombing missions, or combinations thereof. If a mission is failed the campaign continues emphasizing the fact that the war goes on regardless of the outcome of a single mission.</p>\n<p>In addition to the single player campaigns the game features a 8 player multiplayer deathmatch mode in an ad-hoc WLAN network. There's also a game sharing feature for giving a single mission from the game to a friend or playing a multiplayer match without needing the other players to own the game.</p>\n<p>The game includes all other features from the original PC version except that there is no team deathmatch mode, only normal deathmatch. The USAAF campaign is a new feature in the PSP version and does not exist in the original PC version.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Unlike most <em>Final Fantasy</em> games, <em>Dissidia</em> is more of a fighting game rather than a classic role playing game. It still keeps the complex story, character level-up and customization though.\nThe game features main characters from the other Final Fantasy titles, two from each title (the protagonist and the antagonist).\nThe plot revolves around the battle of the two gods, Cosmos and Chaos. The protagonists will form teams in order to fight through Chaos' armies and find their crystals which will later be used to destroy Chaos. Each character has his own campaign to go through at the end of which a crystal will be collected.</p>\n<p>The game also features a single fight and an arcade mode where the player will be able to choose his fighter and the opponent (opponents are automatically chosen by the game if playing in arcade mode though). \nAll of the character's experience and skills received through the campaign are saved for the other game modes (and vice-versa, for example: if Cloud had a level equal to 12 when completing the campaign, he will also appear to have the same level when viewing him in the character roster in Arcade or Quick Battle mode).</p>\n<p>Another feature is that the items you find during the campaign belong to you, the player. That means you can move items from a character to another.\nThe game also features extra content such as villains, costumes etc. which can be unlocked by using PP. You get such points from each fight and completed campaign.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Tenchu: Time of the Assassins</em> is a stealth-action game that is part of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/414/tenchu-series/\">Tenchu series</a>. The plot is set in feudal age Japan, and revolves around a group of ninjas and assassins who get involved into the kidnapping of Lord Gohda's single daughter, Princess Kiku. The game's protagonists are Rikkimaru and Ayame (both ninjas of the Azuma clan, working for Lord Gohda), Rin (a renegade ninja of the Beniya clan), and Tesshu (a medical doctor who works as a hired assassin at night). All four characters' campaigns can be selected right from the start. Each character's campaign encompasses eight missions.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is once again based on the stealth-action genre's fundamental premise of completing the mission goals with being discovered as few times as possible, since the player characters are hopelessly outnumbered by the enemy guards. When the player approaches an unsuspecting enemy from behind, he can perform a stealth kill, which kills the target instantly without risking a fight.</p>\n<p>Mission objectives vary from getting to a certain location on the map, taking out a certain target, to escorting NPCs to a designated area. A distance sensor indicates how great the distance is between the player and the closest enemy, but not the direction in which the enemy is. It also shows whether the enemy is aware of the players presence. As usual for the series, the player is free choose between several weapons and gadgets, which he obtains as reward for completing mission. The better the ranking he receives after the missions, the more and better items he receives.</p>\n<p>Gadgets include throwing knifes, poisonous rice, healing potions, smoke bombs, grenades and many more. Aside from these optional accessories the player always has a trusty grappling hook at his disposal, which can be used to climb houses and ledges.</p>\n<p>The game also features a mission editor to create story-driven single player missions, as well as multiplayer missions. The multiplayer mode can be played competitively and cooperatively with 2 players.</p>",

The king ordered his men to slay the entire family of his loyal knight, Romulus, after Romulus questions the loyalty of the queen.</p>\n<p>You play as one of three characters; the Knight Romulus, his younger brother Remus, or Sylvia, Remus' bride and daughter to the king. As the three lay dying, they make a pact with an evil force, and return infused with unholy power, bent on revenge.</p>\n<p>As they make their way to the king, players must convert foes into zombie slaves. These zombies may be ordered to attack or pin down your opponents, break down barrier/objects, and even form unliving bridges to circumvent obstacles. Zombie minions may also be utilized as inhuman shields, objects to be thrown, and more.</p>\n<p>The game features a metal soundtrack, third person viewpoint, and gameplay similar to that of Tecmo's 3D <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=ninja-gaiden-\">Ninja Gaiden</a> games. Players will collect \"Dark Energy\" along the way, which can be spent on character upgrades. In addition to the single player story mode, Undead Knights has ad-hoc multiplayer support for up to four players.</p>",

        "description": "<p>As a Prinny, one of the lovable, knife-wielding penguins from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Disgaea\">Disgaea</a> series, you have been given the task of searching the netherworld for your master Etna's stolen dessert. A nearly impossible task, due to the numerous demons which populate the netherworld, their quest is made all the more difficult by the Prinny tendency to explode when thrown. Fortunately, Etna has given one of her Prinnies an enchanted scarf which disables their explosive trait. If this Prinny should fall, the next Prinny in line must take the scarf and continue...</p>\n<p>A side-scroller, with an occasional 3D perspective (while air attacking), <em>Prinny: Can I Really Be the Hero?</em> gives you 1000 lives to begin this noticeably challenging quest. The Prinny has the standard jump, attack, and leaping attack moves, as well as a number of other maneuvers. Your Prinny can pirouette (spin) along the ground for momentary invincibility, sprint for short distances, jump then slam downward onto foes with a \"hip pound\" attack, hang onto ledges, and even pick up enemies or explosives and throw them. Occasionally, the player will come across vehicles, such as tanks, which the Prinny can use for limited periods of time.</p>\n<p>Between levels you can interact with Etna, several of the Prinnies, and a few other characters at the castle. These characters further the story, give hints, and allow for save functionality. Additionally, players may access in-game replays here, which can be saved after various events. These replays can be transfered to other PSP systems, so that your friends can watch you in action.</p>\n<p><em>Prinny: Can I Really Be the Hero</em> contains two difficulty settings, a standard mode where you die after three hits, and \"Hell mode\" where it only takes one hit to perish.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The PSP release of <em>Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings</em> is a trimmed-down rendition of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=023272337636\">PS2/Wii</a> versions and also different from the Nintendo DS release. The general storyline is the same, as it is set in 1939 just before World War II begins. Indiana Jones is in search of the Staff of Moses, even though that is not the main quest until halfway through the game. It starts in a Mayan ruin where Charles Kingston takes Jones to the resting place of the jade sphere, a Mayan astronomy guide. Another colleague, Magnus V\u00f6ller, strikes out on his own and quickly runs into trouble. The sphere becomes a bone of contention when the story picks up a few years later when Jones is in San Francisco. He receives a call from Archie Tan who is hunted down by the Chinese who also hold his granddaughter Suzy captive. Jones has to infiltrate Chinatown and rescue both. The sphere then brings him to Panama and eventually also Nepal. The importance of the Staff of Moses is only gradually revealed, as well as Magnus V\u00f6ller as the main villain.</p>\n<p>The game consists of a series of very different action sequences with scripted events, a lot of fighting and minor elements of puzzle solving. Generally Indy is able to fight melee combat using a number of punches and combos, use a pistol and a whip, and manipulate the environment. Many items such as bottles, spears or chairs can be picked up to be used as weapons, while certain items also need to be manipulated to retrieve clues, open valves or lower platforms. Often there are maze-like level layouts and a limited time frame to complete them.</p>\n<p>There are hidden artifacts to collect, and a number of primary and secondary goals that provide Glory and Fortune points. These can be spent to upgrade Indy's abilities (such as additional health, stronger defence or tougher punches) or to unlock concept art or cheats.</p>",

The game remains \u2014as in the initial version\u2014 a hack-and-slash RPG with a top-down view, with quests and dialogue with NPCs. The player's quest of saving the realm of Nelw\u00eb from the spreading evil also involves taking sides with either the adepts of technology, or those of nature.</p>\n<p>The first visible difference from the PC release is the visual style. Cel shading has been abandoned while textures and polygonal models have been downgraded. The game now has a more colourful palette.</p>\n<p>A difference concerning the game mechanic is the absence of companions. The development team's reasoning for this is based on the console's less resources available. As a compensation though, the number of enemies on screen has been increased.</p>\n<p>The last notable difference with the PC release is that the open-world environment has turned into a succession of levels. The reason for this is to adapt the game to the portable style of the console, as the developers had in mind play sessions of ten minutes, although this doesn't affect the duration of the campaign.</p>",

Build a thriving natural ecosystem, a twisting, tunneling dungeon underneath the earth, and fill it with hordes of terrible monsters to protect the evil overlord, Badman. Ensure that he is safe from armies of nasty humans, eager to ransack the place, steal your loot, and prevent Badman from taking over the world!</p>\n<p><em>Holy Invasion of Privacy, Badman!</em> is a strategy game in the vein of the Bullfrog game, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dungeon+Keeper\">Dungeon Keeper</a>. Players use their pickaxe to dig deep into the earth to protect the villain, Badman, from harm. Their goal is to create monsters by digging up nutrient-filled blocks, which produce monsters. The more nutrients inside the block, the more powerful the monster is. By creating all sorts of powerful monsters, you'll increase your 'Battle Power', which indicates how powerful Badman's entire army is.</p>\n<p>Players only have a limited amount of 'Dig Power' available. After this runs out, they cannot dig through the earth any more, and must rely on the monsters to take care of the dungeon. More Dig Power can be earned for each level by not using all the Dig Power you were given, or by earning bonus Dig Power at the end of the level.</p>",

Become a Sackperson, and dress them up as you wish with all sorts of gear that you come across in the game worlds. Explore the levels made by the Creator Curators, or create your own and send them to the world!</p>\n<p><em>LittleBigPlanet</em> is a platform game based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=711719819929\">PlayStation 3 game</a> of the same name. In it, you control a Sackperson, with the base goal of reaching the level exit. However, many physics-based objects and puzzles are encountered along the way. There are also many tricks, traps and enemies. Aside from being able to jump, your Sackperson can also hop between the two levels of depth (unlike the PlayStation 3 version, which features three levels) in the level to walk in front or behind objects, grab objects to push or pull them, or even hitch a ride on a tethered jetpack and fly about the area.</p>\n<p>A huge feature of <em>LittleBigPlanet</em> is the ability to create and share levels with millions of other players around the world. You can make your own levels with objects you've collected in the single player mode, and then use those objects to make anything you like - whether it be a platform level, action game, music box - anything! The level creator allows for a lot of freedom and also offers detailed tutorials on how to use and place objects, as well as tweak their variables. The PSP version of <em>LittleBigPlanet</em> is not able to play four player simultaneous multiplayer like the PS3 version - instead it is a single player only game.</p>",

        "description": "<p>An evil dark lord threatens the peace of the kingdom. He has cast a spell that will destroy the world in exactly 30 seconds, and an intrepid young hero is the only one who can defeat him. This hero has made a pact with the Time Goddess, protector of time, which allows him to level up extremely quickly and turn back time (for a nominal fee, naturally). He must defeat the dark lord before the spell can be completed...but of course, there's always another one waiting to take their place.</p>\n<p><em>Half-Minute Hero</em> is an extremely fast-paced Japanese-style RPG. In the main game mode, <em>Hero 30</em>, each quest requires the player to gather items and equipment, level up, complete story events, and ultimately reach and defeat the boss, all before the strict 30-second time limit expires. There are several dozen missions to play through, each with their own unique location and scenario.</p>\n<p>In addition to the main <em>Hero 30</em> mode, there are also several other modes included in <em>Half-Minute Hero</em>, all of which feature the same strict 30-second time limit:<em> </em>Dark Lord 30* casts the player as a reformed dark lord who punishes evil for the sake of his love. His game is a real-time strategy game where the player can summon various monsters and cast spells to defeat enemies.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Princess 30</em> sees the player take control of a young princess who must leave the castle to find medicine for her sick father, the king. Her game plays as a scrolling shooter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Knight 30</em> puts the player in the role of a knight who must protect a Sage as he casts a spell to clear the area of monsters. His game is an action game much like a tower defense game.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As the game is played, a gallery fills with all the items and enemies the player encounters, as well as with many pieces of production artwork. There is also an ad-hoc multiplayer mode where up to four heroes can race to see who can defeat the dark lord the fastest.</p>",

Now, the people of Pangya Island play a game they call Pangya, which is based on the way in which the legendary hero saved the world -- a game that just so happens to play almost exactly like golf.</p>\n<p><em>Pangya</em> is in many ways a normal golf title. It is based on the free-to-play online title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/26518/albatross18/\">PangYa</a>, and features nine courses, all taken from the PC title. There are a few differences from normal golf, however: players can use a variety of items and special abilities to give their shots properties impossible in real life; and skillful playing will accrue a currency called Pang, which can be used to purchase items, equipment, some of the hundreds of outfits, or even gamble a bit for super-rare items.</p>\n<p>The primary focus of the game is the Story Mode, where the player takes the role of many of the 18 unlockable characters through a story involving a mysterious boy named Kaz and various nefarious elements that mean harm to Pangya Island. There is also the Pangya Tour mode, which includes two elements: License mode sees the player completing a variety of challenges on each course to earn licenses, after which the player can participate in Tournament Mode, where 9 and 18-hole tournaments are played for valuable prizes. Lastly, there is also an ad-hoc wireless mode for up to four players.</p>",

Be a Pro mode allows you to take control of a single player over the course of a season, and play match by match. At the end of each game, your performance will be critiqued. Through good performances you will become the captain of your team and possibly called up for your country. Do badly, and you will get less games and eventually get the sack.</p>\n<p>Multiplayer games against friends are supported via infrastructure or ad hoc mode, in either a standard team game, or in the new Be a Pro Mode.</p>",

In addition, 35 tracks are available from the start, which if added with the different variations for those tracks bumps up the number of to 70.</p>\n<p><em>GT</em> from the get-go provides you with one random car as a present and 100,000 credits to use to buy new cars or upgrade your existing ones. New credits can be gotten by playing the games single player modes. Choose between Time Trial Mode, where you must race against the clock to finish the track with new lap records; Single Race, where you race against 3 CPU cars on a track to be the winner; and Drift Trial, where you slide your car across a track to rack up points, and finally Ad-hoc Mode, where you gather with a group of your friends to race and trade your cars with each other. All but Time Trial provide you with credits.</p>\n<p>For those who feel they need help with their driving, <em>GT</em> includes a mode made to help improve your techniques. The \"Driving Challenge\" mode provides you with a series of challenges and missions used to increase your skill level. Depending on your performance on the missions, you will receive either a gold, silver, or bronze prize, along with some more credits. Aiming for the more harder routes and doing the challenges quickly may result in a gold prize and more prize credits.</p>\n<p>Cars from <em>GT</em> can also be exported to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/49338/gran-turismo-5/\">Gran Turismo 5</a>, giving you the edge on your competition.</p>",

The plot is set in Darius year 1904. Belser has attacked Darius, which had been revived by immigrants from planet Vadis. The game is now in 3D although it's still a left-to-right scroll-shooter. </p>\n<p><em>Darius Burst</em> features a few elements new to the series: first of all, you don\u2019t loose any weapon upgrades when you die. Second, there\u2019s a 3-mode burst laser which is basically a revised version of the giant laser weapon featured in G-Darius. This time you don\u2019t need to capture and sacrifice enemy units to use it and you may even absorb certain types of bullets with it.</p>\n<p>There are 3 silverhawks: \u201cLegend\u201d (the Darius Gaiden ship) piloted by two terminals referred as TI2 and two unlockables: \u201cNext\u201d (a next generation model) piloted by Riga Practica and \u201cOrigin\u201d ship which is the original silverhawk, pilot unknown. Darius Burst is shorter than previous games in the series: there are 11 levels and 8 bosses total. The game features a number of unlockable trials (\"Mission mode\") and a \u201cBurst mode\u201d which challenges the player to complete the game with a single life.</p>\n<p>The soundtrack is composed by Zuntata, Taito\u2019s in-house music band.</p>",

If you defeat them all, then you will unlock some new characters.</p>\n<p>Battle mode: Here you can select several classic fighting modes: single battle, tag battle, tournament battle, elimination battle (5 vs 5) and survival battle. </p>\n<p>Tag Tournament: If the previous mode wasn't enough, here there will be eight tag teams competing for the tag team championship.</p>\n<p>There's also a collection page which shows miniatures of all the personages that you unlock in the Victory Mode.</p>\n<p>Game controls are easy. One button to block, other to hit and kick, other for grapple attacks, other to jump. Top L and R buttons are used for special attacks, which only can be executed when the special attack meter is filled up.

        "description": "<p><em>Need for Speed: ProStreet</em> is an action oriented racing game where the player wants to become the greatest driver on the road. The basic principle is simple: on each of the 13 courses (ten have to be unlocked first) the player can choose between several championships, e.g. regular races, time races or elimination. If he wins he receives money which he uses to upgrade his car and improve its abilities. </p>\n<p>Additionally he also receives experience points (unique to this version of the game) which depend on the used driving helps. If he gets a new level his abilities improve - it is also important because some events are only available after reaching a certain level. In comparison to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/31242/need-for-speed-prostreet/\">regular version</a> the drift and drag events are missing. In return there is a new one which is a mix between checkpoint race and elimination: after every checkpoint the last driver gets eliminated. Up to four cars participate at the same race - a few of them are licensed.</p>",

He walks through the tennis grounds and other locations, talks to people and of course plays matches to progress the plot. Every character has advantages and disadvantages and some of them - basically bosses - are unlocked after beating them.

The basic gameplay premise reminds of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Grand+Theft+Auto\">GTA series</a> but instead of a free roaming experience the campaign consists of 70 short missions which are chosen through a menu screen. Every of them is accompanied with a story sequence in a comic style and features varied goals: escorting, infiltrating an enemy post, stealing cars, kidnapping people, racing, defending the own position against enemy waves and killing people.</p>\n<p>The gameplay itself offers what one would expect from a game like this: if the player is on foot the game is basically a third person shooter - sometimes he has a few other gang members with him and can give them a few commands. The driving is action oriented in either first or third person and the stealth segments are basic and require only to perceive the guard's patrols and kill them from behind. The police intervenes if they see a crime but there is no wanted system like in similar games. At the beginning of the campaign the player has a choice between five gangs with different abilities, e.g. the Triads can drive faster.</p>\n<p>Additionally the game features a big selection of playing modes and mini games, e.g. free roaming in London, driving taxi, photographing points of interests as tourist or fighting off zombies. The mini games in the pub can be played with two players: darts, bowling, pool and a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Snake\">Snake</a> variant as arcade machine, The last noteworthy mode is a tactical game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Risk\">Risk</a>: The player takes control over a crime organization and tries to conquer London which is divided into about 30 districts. In every round he can perform three actions, e.g. move men to another district. Between rounds he can hire more men or acquire bonus cards which give certain advantages. There are three difficulty levels and several winning conditions for this mode.</p>",

It allows the user to choose the topic at hand and if he speaks a related sentence in his language into the included microphone the tool translates it, complete with voice rendering. He can also choose between given statements, along with other functions like a unit converter or a alarm clock.</p>\n<p>But <em>TalkMan</em> also features a \"game mode\" with two mini games. As expected these try to improve the player's listening and speaking skills. In the listening game Max, a blue bird and the tool's mascot, speaks one phrase in all languages (minus the player's native language) and the player has to guess its meaning by choosing one of four given answers. In the second game Max reads out a phrase in a language along with the translation into the player's native language. The the player has to repeat it and the the game gives a score based on his accentuation. Both games feature 25 difficulty levels.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Ten years before the events in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Kingdom+Hearts\">Kingdom Hearts</a>, the universe is still how one remembers it. Maleficent from the Disney-movie Sleeping Beauty is only a threat to Princess Aurora, Peter Pan is still fighting Captain Hook and Experiment 626 has yet to escape the clutches of the Universal Police - all enclosed in their own little worlds with no contact to the outside. In-between on the Isle of Departure are Terra, Ventus and Aqua - a trio of friends and Keyblade wielders who want to become masters. While Terra and Aqua are already ready to take the exam of mastery, Ventus still has a long way ahead of himself. During the exam however it turns out that even Terra isn't ready yet, unable to control the darkness within his heart. At the same time the universe is suddenly threatened by the Unversed - creatures of pure darkness who appeared on the different worlds and wreck havoc under the Disney-characters. To make things worse, Master Xehanort disappears. So Terra and Aqua are tasked with destroying the Unversed and finding the missing Master. Unknown to Terra however, Aqua has a secret mission: watching Terra in order to find out if he can control the darkness within him. Ventus on the other hand is goaded into following Terra by a mysterious other character...and so the adventure begins.</p>\n<p>In its core <em>Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep</em> follows the same principles as the other iterations of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=kingdom-hearts-series\">series</a>. The game still mixes gameplay-elements from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/4847/final-fantasy-series/\">Final Fantasy series</a> with characters and locations from Disney-properties like Mickey Mouse. To that end the player visits the Dwarf Woodlands to help Snow White escape the evil Queen, fights in the Olympus Coliseum with Hercules and helps Element 626 (Stich) flee from Deep Space while always being confronted with the forces of darkness including boss fights against formerly inanimated and now possessed objects, other Keyblade warriors and even Disney-characters like the already mentioned Maleficent. The story however is told from the three different viewpoints of the main characters. So to fully understand everything, the player will need to play through the game with all three (he makes his selection at the start). Each character will also see and experience different parts of the levels. While Terra will be send out by the Queen to kill Snow White, Aqua will actually be the one who has to protect her from the evil queen after Terra has already left the world. In addition each of the characters is specialised in different commands at the start of the game with Aqua being more of a mage and Terra more of a warrior.</p>\n<p>As opposed to the previous installments of the series, the player now travels the land mostly by himself. Only during a few boss-fights he will join forces with his friends or when he needs to protect another character. He is however not really alone out there in the vast universe thanks to a new mechanic in the overhauled combat system called \"Dimension Link\". If enough energy is available, the player can activate the D-Link to a friendly character, giving him full access to that characters command deck basically trading the current character for the other one. Additional D-Links are automatically unlocked by successfully completing the different worlds. And while the player can't choose the contents of the other characters deck or level those commands up, killed enemies will occasionally drop, in addition to money, crafting crystals and health- and D-Link-energy bubbles, an effect when a D-Link is active. Up to two can be collected for each character which will not only increase the deck size but also if both are collected give the player access to an additional form allowing him to use Maleficent's Dragon Breath for example.</p>\n<p>The command deck contains up to eight techniques, abilities and spells - all simply called commands - which allows the character e.g. to heal himself or throw his keyblade at the enemy. After the current command is used, the deck automatically switches to the next one while the previous one regenerates until it can be used again. So instead of mana, the only resource is time. Each of the commands will automatically level up just by using it up to five times depending on the command increasing the damage it deals and unlocking additional command styles and finishing commands. The character itself also earns experience points and gains levels making him stronger and increasing his survivability. In addition successfully hitting an enemy fills up the command gauge, changing the Command Style of the character and making him more powerful. If the player keeps hitting the enemy, this bar will also fill up and unleash a devastating attack at the end (or unlock an even higher level Command Style if available). The last way to unleash hell upon enemies is the ShotLock Mode with which the player can aim at multiple enemies in first person mode and then start a series of attacks during which he's invulnerable.</p>\n<p>New Commands can either be bought at shops, created through crafting or by playing some of the five included mini-games. Crafting involves merging two higher level commands using a crystal into a new command. One of the mini-games, simply called Command Board, is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Monopoly\">Monopoly</a>-knock-off in which the players place commands on a bought field instead of buying streets and planting hotels. Each time an enemy player hits the field, the owner earns points as well as the command on the field itself. Buying fields from other players or landing on a bonus field will earn the player the chance to earn a new command. The winner of the mini-game is the one who first hits the points limit.</p>\n<p>The game features a multiplayer-mode for up to six players via ad-hoc-wifi allowing them to play \"Command Board\", fight each other in death match, play the mini-game \"Rumble Racing\" (a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Mario+Kart\">Mario Kart</a>-clone) or fight side by side in Survival Modes against hordes and hordes of enemies including boss fights. Multiplayer even features additional commands not available in the normal game.</p>",

Like with the previous console games in the series, it is a party game that features over 3,000 questions and it can be played in solo or multiplayer modes. Multiplayer games are supported for a single PSP and a single copy of the game (Pass Around), a single copy of the game and multiple devices (Game Sharing), or multiple PSPs and multiple copies (regular wireless mode).</p>\n<p>In the Pass Around mode six rounds can be played: Picture This, Rollover, Short Fuse, Weak Spot, Virus and Snapshot - each with different gameplay and rules. There is also a Quiz Host mode where one player becomes the master of ceremony and leads the quiz. That way he can show a picture on the PSP to the different players and add/deduct points for the answers.</p>\n<p>The solo mode has fifteen challenges to beat. Each challenge gives the player a bronze, silver or gold medal. It is also possible to unlock trophies for things like numbers of right answers in a row or fastest time for an answer.</p>",

It is your grandfather's farm but he has died and your father wants to sell the land to the Funland Corporation. They intend to bulldoze the place and turn it into an amusement park. That's not what Grandpa Gus worked for all his life, so you decide to take over the farm that has fallen into disarray a bit and make it profitable again. You have two years to raise $50,000. The gameplay is very similar to previous titles: grow and sell crops, raise animals, mine ores, befriend the neighbours and perhaps even find a wife.</p>",

As a Prinny who found a magic watch, the player has to go back in time to find out what has really happened. To do so, Prinny can possess various characters from the Disgaea series and follow them through the plot. In order to change the past, he can also Mind Control the character he is possessing when said character has to make a choice. Mind control allows Prinny to select one of three options that will change the series of events from that point. At a few points in the game, when major events occur or are prevented from occurring, Prinny's soul is \"saved\", meaning that the next time travel will send him back to that specific point to start over. The goal of the game is to start over and over, finding as much information as possible and prevent Laharl from being \"assassinated\" and saving the future of the Prinnies' salaries.</p>\n<p>The story is presented in the form of dialogues between the characters, as well as sprite animations. And has many different endings, depending of the choices made by the player. The endings are themselves often short advertisings for Disgaea and Nippon Ichi Software games.</p>\n<p>To follow the story's progress, the player has access to a time table of all the events, following every character's steps, Prinny's diary, giving clues about the plot and how to change how the story unfolds, and a database of the characters, places and other trivia from the Disgaea series, and sometimes for other Nippon Ichi Software games.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Block Crash 123</em> is a Hello Kitty-themed Breakout clone featuring illustrations from popular Japanese artists such as okama and KEI. There are ten characters to choose from, one from each of the ten featured artists, and twelve stages for each. The game plays like most any other Breakout clone: hit the ball with the paddle, trying to destroy all the blocks with it without letting it fall out the bottom of the screen. Run out of lives, and the stage must be restarted. Blocks occasionally drop power-ups (or power-downs) when destroyed, which will give a temporary effect to either the ball or the paddle when picked up.</p>\n<p>The player can choose any character, but the stages within must be done in order. Completing all stages for a character unlocks their illustration, and completing all characters unlocks a bonus stage. Each character's stages feature different themes and gameplay gimmicks; for example, one character's stages include blocks that slowly advance downward, while another character's stages are played with the system on its side.</p>\n<p>There is also a clock &amp; calendar mode, where the player can select from unlocked illustrations and a variety of visual designs to create a custom-design clock. The complete list of featured artists is: okama, KEI, Teruhiko Imaizumi, Poyoyon Rock, Keito Koume, Shimeko, Kohaku Kuroboshi, Aoi Nishimata, Eiji Komatsu, and POP.</p>",

It is a cel-shaded locked-view fighting game much like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Street+Fighter+IV\">Street Fighter IV</a>, and includes more than a dozen characters from each publisher's catalog, including contemporary series as well as older classic titles.</p>\n<p>The game features three main modes. First, there is arcade mode, which pits the player against seven randomly-selected characters in order. Next is quest mode, which plays more like a scrolling beat-em-up and tasks the player with fulfilling various time-limited objectives like destroying targets or collecting keys, and which can be played solo or with up to three friend in wireless co-op. Last is the free battle mode, where the player can play a free battle against the computer or a friend via local wireless play.</p>\n<p>The game system is relatively simple; characters have a limited set of moves, but they can be customized per character. Each character can also be upgraded using orbs earned in quest mode to buy new moves. In addition to regular moves, each character also has special super moves, which require use of a special bar which fills as the player lands blows. The player also unlocks assist characters as the game is played, which can be assigned to characters to give special assist moves. </p>\n<p>There is also a database mode where the player can read introductions for each of the playable and assist characters. The full list of featured series are as follows.</p>\n<p>From <em>Shonen Sunday</em>, characters appear from <em>Zettai Karen Children</em> by Takashi Shiina, <em>Shij\u014d Saiky\u014d no Deshi Kenichi</em> by Syun Matsuena, <em>Inuyasha</em> by Rumiko Takahashi, <em>Hayate no Gotoku!</em> by Kenjiro Hata, <em>Kekkaishi</em> by Yellow Tanabe, <em>Ky\u016bkyoku Ch\u014djin R</em> by Masami Yuuki, <em>ARMS</em> by Kyoichi Nanatsuki and Ryoji Minagawa, <em>Law of Ueki</em> by Tsubasa Fukuchi, <em>Hon\u014d no Tenk\u014dsei</em> by Kazuhiko Shimamoto, <em>Flame of Recca</em> by Nobuyuki Anzai, <em>Ushio to Tora</em> by Kazuhiro Fujita, and <em>YAIBA</em> by Gosho Aoyama.</p>\n<p>From <em>Shonen Magazine</em>, characters appear from <em>Hajime no Ippo</em> by George Morikawa, <em>Air Gear</em> by Oh!great, <em>Fairy Tail</em> by Hiro Mashima, <em>Mah\u014d Sensei Negima!</em> by Ken Akamatsu, <em>Cromartie High School</em> by Eiji Nonaka, <em>Ashita no Joe</em> by Asao Takamori and Tetsuya Chiba, <em>Get Backers</em> by Yuya Aoki and Rando Ayamine, <em>Kotaro Makaritoru!</em> by Tatsuya Hiruta, <em>Samurai Deeper Kyo</em> by Akimine Kamijyo, <em>Tiger Mask</em> by Ikki Kajiwara and Naoki Tsuji, <em>Devilman</em> by Go Nagai, and <em>Cyborg 009</em> by Shotaro Ishinomori.</p>",

It has several in-game modes such as 'Historical Fights', where you will face up against all the opponents from all 6 Rocky motion pictures, 'Exibition' for quick fights and a bunch of unlockable fighters and arenas (including ALL arenas from ALL the movies). It also has some devastating 'combo moves' and a 'power mood' feature that will increase the power of your punches during each fight.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Rito Yuki is an average high school kid; he's not particularly athletic, and always gets nervous around girls. One day, though, a cute alien princess named Lala showed up at his house and moved in with him, and things haven't been the same since. Lala starts going to his school, learning about Earth life, and making Rito's daily existence far more difficult than it need be. But despite living with a cute young girl, he only has eyes for his long-time crush, Haruna Sairenji.</p>\n<p><em>To LOVE-Ru</em> is a Japanese-style adventure game based on the ecchi-comedy anime and manga series created by Saki Hasemi and Kentaro Yabuki. Rito's class is off to a beach resort for a four-day school trip, meaning lots of fun and lots of cute girls in swimsuits. The story is told from Rito's perspective as the trip progresses, and the player is regularly given choices that affect the story path and which character's ending the game leads to. For example, while riding on the bus to the resort, the player can choose to sit with either Haruna or Lala.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there \"Trouble\" events every so often, in which the player must hit the shoulder buttons at the proper time to prevent an accident or help another character out. There are also minigames such as a watermelon smash and a tug-of-war contest. All dialogue in the game is fully voiced, and the player can save at any point. Additionally, recent dialogue is stored in a log so the player can reread conversations, and even listen to the dialogue again. After completing the game, a bonus mode is unlocked where the various in-game images can be viewed. There are multiple endings depending on the player's choices in the game, each involving a different character.</p>",

There are three games included:<em> </em><em>Jigsaw Puzzle</em>* is, as the name suggests, a standard jigsaw puzzle mode. The pieces come oriented properly, so the player only needs to place them in the correct spot. There are two difficulty levels: easy puzzles have 24 pieces, while hard puzzles have 48 pieces.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Picture Perfect</strong> is a nonogram puzzle much like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6033/marios-picross/\">Picross</a>. Using the numbers at the top and left as hints, the player must mark the proper squares to create a picture. There are three difficulty levels; the higher the level, the larger the puzzle.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tasty Tidbits</strong> is a falling-block puzzle very similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Puyo+Puyo\">Puyo Puyo</a>. Kitty heads and fruits drop in pairs from the top of the screen and must be arranged. Connect four pieces of the same color, including at least one fruit, and they will be cleared. Easy mode starts the player at level 1, while hard mode starts the player at level 11.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of the mini-games unlock pictures and parts for the <em>Hello Kitty Gadget</em>, a clock &amp; calendar featuring dozens of Hello Kitty illustrations. The design mode lets the player choose from any of the parts unlocked from the mini-games.</p>",

It is remarkably similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Konami\">Konami's</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Beatmania\">Beatmania series</a>: blocks, which represent sounds in the music, fall from the top of the screen in columns. When they pass an on-screen bar, the corresponding button must be pressed to play the note. If too many notes are missed, the song is failed and ends early.</p>\n<p>The game features more than 50 songs and multiple difficulty levels. In addition to the standard game, there is a practice mode, a challenge mode, and a two-player network battle mode. More music and other bonuses unlock as the game is played, and there is also a gallery where the player can peruse unlocked music and videos.</p>",

Taking the reverse approach compared to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Bomberman:+Act+Zero\">Bomberman: Act Zero</a>'s dark, gritty rework, it reimagines Bomberman as a team of brightly-colored <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Power+Rangers\">Power Rangers</a>-style bomb-dropping crime-fighting <em>sentai</em> superheroes. The original 8-bit Bomberman also appears in full pixelated 3D glory.</p>\n<p>The game itself plays much like any other Bomberman game: Drop bombs to trap and destroy enemies, blow up crates for power-up items, avoid the various hazards on each stage, and try not to get blown up yourself. The story mode sees each member of the Bombermen team play first through several Classic stages as their blocky retro equivalent to regain their powers, then on to more dangerous Arrange stages as their sentai hero form. In Arrange modes, each Bomber has their own unique abilities: Pink Bomber, for example, can jump over blocks and other hazards with proper timing.</p>\n<p>The other single-player mode is Challenge mode. This mode is a timed race to score as many points as possible over multiple stages within a strict time limit. There is, of course, also wifi multiplayer for up to five players, and even minigames that can be played by linking with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/23593/iq-mania/\">I.Q Mania</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=XI+Coliseum\">XI Coliseum</a>.

        "description": "<p>One side of Berge was bathed in constant light, and is known as Lustrous Berge. The other half is cloaked in constant darkness, and is known as Dark Berge. A miasma-filled chasm called the Black Precipice divides the two halves and has been in place for so long that most residents of the world don\u2019t even know that the other half exists... And now, events loom that threaten both halves of the world. Fate has chosen a champion from each half, and now, the player must choose which champion to play as. The stage has been set. Will it be the best of times, or the worst of times?</p>\n<p>In <em>Hexyz Force</em>, players choose one of the two main characters, either young priestess Cecilia \"Ceci\" Armaclite or veteran knight Levant von Schweitzer. Both paths tell different parts of the story, so the game is effectively two RPGs in one. Combat is initiated on the field map, but much like another <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/6305/atlus/\">Atlus</a> PSP title, battles can be avoided by dodging the enemies on the field.</p>\n<p>If combat is entered, the game turns into a standard turn-based RPG, but with a rock-paper-scissors elemental system called the Divine Aspects. Each weapon is linked to an element, and if the attacks follow the proper pattern, a damage gauge will build that will multiply the damage once the chain breaks. Both the enemy and the player have access to the gauge, so the enemy can use it to unload huge damage onto the player. </p>\n<p>As is the case with most Sting RPGs, weapons are destructible items. The game also has a weapon crafting and fusion system that replaces shops. Players get components to create items from battle or by collecting them from Harvest Points that are spread around the world.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Previously in the Star Wars saga, an unknown story developed between two brothers, codenamed X1 and X2. These two brothers, cloned from a Jedi, grew up to become an important part of the Clone Wars, trainers and leaders of the army that would lead the Republic against those that tempted to destroy order within the Galaxy. Unfortunately for both, their worlds would come crushing down as the Emperor rose to power, putting into place Order 66 and dismantling the Jedi Order in one fowl swoop. X2, desperate to hold onto his dreams of peace, joined the Rebel Alliance, a small group who opposed the Empire's ways. X1, however, remained with the new leaders of the Galaxy. Now, the two brothers are on a collision course to decide their fates, and the fate of the Galaxy itself.</p>\n<p>Besides the 12 level campaign between brothers, <em>Elite Squadron</em> follows the similar path of the previous <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Star+Wars:+Battlefront\">Battlefront series</a>, specifically its multiplayer, where two teams compete to capture parts of the game map. Maps can vary from ground, space or within starship battles, most encompassing all three elements. Each player can select from pre-determined character styles, some more adept at certain skills than others (such as piloting an X-Wing or Tie-Fighter, or using explosives.) The single player campaign uses most of these elements in-between the story arc.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Lord of Arcana</em> is an Action RPG game in which the player (as a customizable character) is taken to the world of Horodyn, where he will have to acquire the Arcana power. To do so, he will need to hone his skills by completing quests from the village of Porto Carillo's slayers guild. The quests consist of defeating specific foes, gathering material, and so on. As the player becomes stronger, the Arcana Stones from the nearby Arayd Temple will awaken, allowing the Master Guardians to be challenged, and their power claimed.</p>\n<p>The quests happen in set locations such as forests, caves and deserts. Upon defeating monsters in these quests, various materials can be obtained (either from the field, after battles or by destroying Monster Parts) and be used to craft equipment in the village. Apart from usable items like potions and charms, a variety of weapons, armors, orbs and cards can be equipped.</p>\n<p>Weapons: five types of weapons exist, each with their specific strengths and weaknesses. Changing weapons will be useful depending on which opponent the player wants to face.</p>\n<p>Armors: The armors, shield, and headgear. They can bestow great protection and sometimes have slots to equip orbs.</p>\n<p>Orbs: They have a wide array of powers. Some can be used to boost elemental attacks or defenses, some allow quicker movement or makes the weak points of monsters visible.</p>\n<p>Cards: Needed to cast magic. There are regular spells and the more powerful Ultimate Magics, which summons the Arcana Guardians to perform some incredible feats.</p>\n<p>The Guild also acts as a place where multiple players can join and quest together via the PSP's ad hoc mode. The available quests are the ones that the host player can access in regular gameplay.</p>",

The game consists of two parts: managing your troops between battles by spending money or experience to acquire new troops, level up veteran troops or increase your \"Patton's skills\" to gain combat bonuses and the missions itself, the completion of which gives you a certain amount of points depending on how well you did.</p>\n<p>There are several mission types: Attack, Infiltration, Defense, Sabotage and Escort. The troops you have span from simple infantry soldiers to Rangers, snipers and even tanks and aircrafts. Each unit has a certain, separate amount of points for movement and attack. Also, each unit has two kinds of attacks and some troops like the commandos also have a context-sensitive attack (e.g. knife stealth-kill).</p>\n<p>The game's two-player local multiplayer works as a hot-seat mode and consists of deathmatches taking place on the games campaign-maps. Although the game is played from an isometric perspective, its powered by a 3D engine, with the ability to rotate the camera freely.</p>",

After achieving specific amounts of points the player unlocks new tracks. There's also a Museum feature with items related to Michael's career.

        "description": "<p><em>Raoh Gaiden - Ten no Ha\u014d</em> is a 1-on-1 fighting game based on the manga and anime spinoff of the classic manga <em>Fist of the North Star</em>. Over a dozen characters are present, each of which has their own specific set of attacks and abilities, as well as specific special attacks that require building special meter before they can be used.</p>\n<p>As in the original manga, the game focuses on Raoh, Kenshiro's oldest brother and a brutal warlord. The story mode casts the player as Raoh, fighting many of the characters he encounters in the original story, while the versus mode allows the player to select any character and fight against either the CPU or another player via wifi.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The prequel to Square Enix's 2009 title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/42166/dissidia-final-fantasy/\">Dissidia: Final Fantasy</a>, Dissidia 012 also contains the original's story remade to fit the new mechanics. Dissidia 012 tells the tale of the twelfth cycle of the ongoing War of the Gods, and the heroes summoned to the realm for that cycle.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to defeat a given opponent, or a gauntlet of opponents, depending on the free-play style chosen, or to complete a series of dungeons containing opponents in story-mode. Largely the same as its predecessor, gameplay-wise, it nonetheless contains modifications such as the Assist system, through which you can call another character to execute attacks on your opponent, or take a hit for you. The story mode also has the addition of a free-roam game world, retaining the tile-based system of its predecessor only for dungeons entered from the gameworld via \"gateways\". As before, it retains the character level-up and equipment/skill customisation elements.</p>\n<p>A rather large character roster now includes characters from Final Fantasy I to Final Fantasy XIII and every game in between.</p>\n<p>It also has alternate skin DLC for several of the characters, and one bonus assist character DLC that can only be obtained by purchasing the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dissidia+duodecim+prologus+Final+Fantasy\">Dissidia duodecim prologus Final Fantasy</a> prologue chapter, which is presented as a separate game.</p>",

The robots (named by the prefixal acronym \u00abLBX\u00bb from \u00abLittle Battlers Experience\u00bb; thus names of theirs are, for instance, \u00abLBX Achilles\u00bb, \u00abLBX Amazones\u00bb \u00abLBX Warrior\u00bb and so forth) are moved by a small internal engine and able of being personalised, to the double purpose of well-suiting the owner's taste and be victorious in battle against other game characters' robots. Combat takes place in cardboard dioramas, which are nothing but miniaturized reproductions of locales, with an anime-inspired visual style. It is done in real-time where the player takes direct control of the mechas.</p>",

Different rooms contain different opponents, and the player must wager money to compete in most of them. Winning matches will award money that can be used to purchase new outfits and accessories. The 3D graphics from the console release have also been replaced with 2D sprite graphics.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Tactics</em> is a fantasy role-playing game, utilizing the 3.5 Edition core rule set, which takes place in the eastern border reaches of the Lindesi, a group of kingdoms governed by a human High-King far to the West,</p>\n<p>Players begin a campaign by selecting or creating a character to be the hero, then selecting, or creating a group of companions to form the party. At the start, you may only have five companions in your party, but as the campaign continues, you may recruit up to eleven companions. You may select pre-generated characters, create your own group of characters for the party, or even use the quick-start option which will automatically provide you with a set of pre-generated characters. If the main hero you create or select for the campaign dies, the campaign will end. You may select from all eleven core character classes: barbarian, bard, cleric, druid, fighter, monk, paladin, ranger, rogue, sorcerer, and wizard, plus the psionic warrior and psion. Additional party members you may recruit during the adventure are found in the marketplace, for example, you may recruit clerics and paladins at the Temple, and fighters, barbarians and psychic warriors may be recruited at the Mercenary Hall.</p>\n<p>The adventure is played by moving the party icon along the map, where you make choices on which locations to enter, and with whom you may interact, but combat is handled in turn-based tactics fashion, on a grid with five-foot squares, where initiative determines the order when each character moves, and each character during their turn may perform actions according to the 3.5 Edition combat rules. Each character, however, has several options during their turn from the Action menu. Spells and psionics are also available for the appropriate characters. For those unfamiliar with the 3.5 Edition rule set, the manual has a glossary of D&amp;D rules terms and there is a glossary available from the main menu in the game.</p>\n<p>Wireless multiplayer mode allows you to host or join a game with up to four players, featuring game modes such as Dungeon Bash, or Deathmatch Battle, but you are only permitted to use pre-generated characters.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Football Manager Handheld 2009</em> is the second Football Manager game released for the PSP. FMH is a slimmed down version of SI Games Football Manager series for PC. </p>\n<p>The biggest improvement from last year is the inclusion of a 2D match engine with two different camera angles which makes it easier to see how your tactics work out on the field. Another new feature is the possibility to have up to four playable top tier divisions so you can work in different countries throughout your career. As usual, all leagues, clubs and players are updated for the 2008/09 season.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Hilton Family</em> is an educational simulation used as the fourth component for the training of new employees at the US Hilton Garden Inn hotels. Limited at 500 copies, the game was not sold in retail and requires a specific memory stick in order to launch the game next to the UMD disc, to prevent use outside of the training facilities. The game is played inside a recreated Hilton Garden Inn through a first-person perspective. At the reception desk a name can be chosen along with one of four roles that represent the game modes: housekeeping, food &amp; beverage, guest service and engineering. Each role has the player perform a number of tasks that are rated with a SALT (Satisfaction and Loyalty Tracking) score, compared against the real SALT ratings. The SALT score is based on the customer's appreciation and patience, and further affected through the choices in branching dialogue trees with the customers and the time to complete the tasks. Next to the main game there is a tutorial where the tasks are explained.</p>\n<p>For housekeeping, the player goes from room to room to clean them. Everything needs to be cleaned, furniture needs to be put back in its proper place, curtains need to be opened, carpets are vacuumed and redundant hangers should be removed from closets. For food &amp; beverage the player needs to greet people and serve them drinks and food. Orders are stored on a computer where the check and receipts can be printed as well. Various items such as dishes and coffee can be taken from the kitchen to bring them to customers. One item to take into account is the temperature of the food. Dishes needs to be carried over quickly to avoid serving a cold plate. There are different sessions such as breakfast and dinner. Guest service takes place at the reception desk. The player needs to check in customers, answer questions and book rooms. Items need to be restocked and engineering problems need to be reported. The final mode is engineering. It involves fixed appliances such as AC units or televisions, fixing a clogged toilet, and replacing bulbs and batteries in remotes. Next to a general task lists there is a walkie-talkie to respond to sudden problems and random events.</p>",

This time, however, instead of the all-mighty Patapon god, the player takes the role of an Uberhero, and can join force with other Uberheroes in multiplayer.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the game, the player resurrects one of three Patapon heroes: Taterazay, the shield hero, Yumiyacha, the bow hero, and Yarida the spear hero. The resurrected hero will lead the army as the Mighty One's avatar. Instead of squad units like in the previous installments, the army is formed of the Superhero Patapon, and three other units, Ton, Chin and Kan, the disciples of the three Patapon heroes. Each unit has customizable skills and equipment and levels-up by gaining experience points in quests. The Superhero also wears a mask that can be changed by acquiring other masks to give him different abilities. Every level can now be played in up to 8 players co-op. Communication between the players is done through the new Pata-Text function.</p>",

The first one is a deathmatch in which the player needs to defeat his opponents by making them hit the light trail of his bike and score the most points, and the light cycle can move freely on the arena. The second variation is a classic light cycle game in which you can only turn on straight angles.</li>\n<li>Light Cycle race - a race to the finish line in which the player needs to outrun the opponents.</li>\n<li>Recognizer - the player needs to shoot tanks, turrets and light cycles from an automatically moving vessel and score the most points, also avoiding being hit back.</li>\n<li>Tank Control - a deathmatch tank battle.</li>\n<li>Disc Battle - this mode combines platforming and fighting with enemies hand-to-hand or using the disc.</li>\n</ul>",

In this land exist men whose purpose is to meet with the the twelve Star Maidens to conceive Star Children by pouring energy into a special device. Itsuki is one of those chosen ones.</p>\n<p><em>Conception: Ore no Kodomo o Undekure!</em> is a RPG with Visual Novel elements. The player has to make Itsuki bond with the Star Maidens in order to spawn Star Children who will accompany him into the dungeons and fight the Impurities. The abilities and looks of the Star Children are determined by which character is the mother, and by Itsuki's bond with her.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the game, the player may choose from a selection of names for Itsuki, and select his birthday (Zodiac sign) and Blood Type. The story is then told through conversations reminiscent of Visual Novels, and animations. During the conversations, the player sometimes have to choose what Itsuki says from multiple-choice answers. To travel between the many locations in the world of Granvania, the player simply selects them from a map. Locations where events will trigger are marked as such. Once a party of four Star Children is made, Itsuki can set out to explore the dungeons. The dungeons are made of four parts, one for each season. Only the spring season is available at the beginning. Itsuki and the Star Children then explore, collect various treasures and fight monsters, which are shown on the map. In battle, the Star Children fight as one, acting upon the selected commands. Every turn, once a command is selected for either Itsuki or the Star Children, the player may move them to one of the four sides of an enemy to inflict more damage, or move them to a different enemy. They are rewarded experience at the end of each battle, which will enable them to eventually grow stronger.</p>",

With the help of his soul blade \"Yukihime\" and various companions, Rage embarks on his greatest quest yet.</p>\n<p><em>Shining Blade</em> utilizes an all-new battle system, \"Concerto\", which relies on strategy and cooperation between the party members. Rage may be accompanied by up to four allies during battle, and can make use of swords, bows, and magic to defeat enemies. The game also introduces a new class, the songstress, who perform songs to give the party a special advantage in battle.

        "description": "<p><em>Tales of the Heroes: Twin Brave</em> is a spin-off of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tales\">Tales series</a>, crossing the universes of the franchise by including heroes from previous flagship titles as playable characters. Significantly, <em>Tales of the Heroes</em> doesn't feature the \"Linear Motion Battle System\" present in most games of the series. Instead, gameplay mimics the style of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dynasty+Warriors\">Dynasty Warriors</a> in which the player wanders a map full of enemies and must fight crowds of them simultaneously. Dubbed \"Aggressive Chain Capacity\" (A.CC), the battle system involves depleting A.CC points through the use of artes, and regaining these points through free movement, normal attacks, or defensive actions such as guarding. Additionally, each playable character is paired up with another from the same universe; depending on which character is chosen, the other is computer-controlled and accompanies the player to battle.</p>\n<p>The game features five modes: Story Mode, Free Mode, Tournament, Score Attack, and Extreme Mode. Story Mode follows a set of selected characters through either a serious or comical story, including Cress Albane from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10905/tales-of-phantasia/\">Phantasia</a>, Stahn Aileron from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/10900/tales-of-destiny/\">Destiny</a>, Veigue Lungberg from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/17713/tales-of-rebirth/\">Rebirth</a>, Chloe Valens from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/21528/tales-of-legendia/\">Legendia</a>, and Jude Mathis from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/83600/tales-of-xillia/\">Xillia</a>. Fifteen stories are included in all, one for each represented game. Free Mode allows for access to all unlocked stages and characters while Tournament offers the same freedom of character for a gauntlet of enemies on varying difficulties. In Score Attack, race against the clock to beat high scores on a stage of your choosing, and in Extreme Mode, complete challenging objectives using pre-selected characters.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The PSP received its own adaptation of the superhero sequel <em>Spider-Man 2</em>. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/13848/spider-man-2/\">console version</a> with its open-world design, the PSP game is strictly linear. Spider-Man must make his way through 19 levels, each presenting him with a series of challenges. He must beat up thugs and robots, save a police car from dropping from a bridge, turn on the sprinkler system in a burning warehouse, carry away civilians from a failed fusion experiment, rescue hostages in a museum and much more. Spidey can swing from buildings, pull himself up to the ceiling and crawl on walls to get around. To defeat the many enemies, he can use a variety of kicks and punches which can be built up into combos. His webbing comes into play in various ways: he can shoot it at enemies to knock them out temporarily and must also use it to complete various objectives, like fixing leaky pipes for the sprinkling system. During the game, Spidey earns Hero Points, which can be spent after each level to unlock new moves and some bonuses. Hero Points are awarded for completing a level, using combos, high levels of health and webbing remaining, time used and secret spider symbols found.</p>\n<p>The game follows the story of the film only loosely (in the levels concerning Doctor Octopus). Many other Spider-Man villains are featured and must be defeated, including Mysterio, the Rhino, the Shocker and the Vulture. The story is told through a mixture of pre-rendered and in-game cutscenes, for which film actors <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/60110/tobey-maguire/\">Tobey Maguire</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/147495/kirsten-dunst/\">Kirsten Dunst</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/147494/alfred-molina/\">Alfred Molina</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/193717/j-k-simmons/\">JK Simmons</a> reprise their roles.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dynasty Warriors Vol.2</em> is the second installment is the long-running <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/854/dynasty-warriors-series/\">Dynasty Warriors series</a> to be developed exclusively for PSP. Like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=ULUS-10004\">its predecessor</a>, the game retells the story from Luo Guangzhong's <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em> by having the player control an officer from the Wu, Wei or Shu kingdoms through the most important battles of each kingdom's storyline. The playable characters and their appearance are taken from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/18144/dynasty-warriors-5/\">Dynasty Warriors 5</a>.</p>\n<p>Each scenario has branching stages, which can be be unlocked by playing the same scenario but choosing a different path. Each battle can then be played in free mode.</p>\n<p>The battles consist of a map separated in numerous smaller areas. These areas can be allied or enemy camps, supply depots, or open fields. The player has to move from area to area, entering a battlefield when the area is under enemy control or is attacked by the enemy army. Defeating enemy officers and squads until their troop's morale drops to 0 will liberate the area, sometimes yielding rewards such as supplies, which add to the total time of the battle, uncover hidden areas, or refill some health.</p>\n<p>Before each stage, the player can equip a different weapon and mount, and choose up to four generic officers to accompany the selected character. Each of these officers has a level, rank, squadron units, and special abilities that will influence the outcome of the battle. Which officer can be selected depends on the player character's command stat. If the command number is 30, it means that officers with a combined level of 30 can be selected. </p>\n<p>In battle, the player has to defeat as many foes as possible by combining regular attacks and charge attacks, and unleashing the series' signature Musou attack. Different weapons allow for more combo attacks and higher attack strength. By defeating enemies, the character will gain experience and level up. However, the level resets between battle, and the gained experience is converted into points to raise the officers ranks. Once a stage's winning conditions are met, the army is deemed victorious, but if the player character is defeated, supplies get exhausted or the main camp is taken, the game is over. Upon victory, the player is rewarded with new officers and weapons or mounts acquired in battle.</p>\n<p>New playable characters are unlocked by completing the Musou mode. Different characters get unlocked depending on which scenario is played, and which battles are won.</p>\n<p>Other than the Musou (Story) mode, the game has a Free mode, and Multiplayer mode. The Multiplayer mode allows for up to four players via Ad Hoc and offers different games: Bombs Away, Battle Royal, Time Attack and Sudden Death.</p>",

Members of this special unit leave their names and their pasts behind when joining, to be from then on referred to only by number.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is similar to the original, although skewing more closely to the PSP sequel, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Valkyria+Chronicles+2\">Valkyria Chronicles 2</a> in terms of execution. As such, the battlefields are small and divided into distinct zones, and the number of units available to be deployed at once is reduced.

        "description": "<p><em>Dead or Alive Paradise</em> is a port and remake of the 360 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/26263/dead-or-alive-xtreme-2/\">Dead or Alive: Xtreme 2</a> for the PSP. It has the same gameplay and mainly expands with having more mini-games. It is the second game in the series for a handheld device, following the iOS game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Girls+of+DOA+BlackJack:+%EF%BD%9EKasumi-Version%EF%BD%9E\">Girls of DOA BlackJack: \uff5eKasumi-Version\uff5e</a>.</p>\n<p>The game takes place on New Zack island, where the <em>Dead or Alive</em> girls go on holiday for 2 weeks. The player chooses a girl at the beginning of this vacation and after the two weeks have passed, you can choose to continue with the same girl or choose another one to go on holiday with. The playable girls in <em>Dead or Alive Paradise</em> are Ayane, Christie, Helena, Hitomi, Kasumi, Kokoro, Leifang, Lisa, Tina and as a special character Rio Rollins from the anime series <em>Rio: Rainbow Gate</em>.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is mainly about playing volleyball in 2-on-2 matches. Right after that, interacting with the other girls and exchanging gifts is an important factor, as it can influence how good (or bad) your volleyball partner plays. The game also offers multiple mini-games, which you can play for fun or when you are without a volleyball partner. Entirely new is the option to buy a camera and go around the island to hold photo shoots with the girls. The photos can be collected in an album which can be viewed later. You can also visit a casino during the evening, where you can gamble with the money you earned by playing volleyball matches and mini-games.</p>",

The game takes place three years after the events of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/26265/phantasy-star-universe/\">Phantasy Star Universe</a> when all four races have been defeated and have been sealed off the SEED. In this game the player is part of the private military mercenary group Little Wing on Clad 6, a space colony resort.</p>\n<p>It is possible for players to transfer their character from <em>Phantasy Star Portable</em>. The character will start at level 1 again and have no items, but the game rewards you with multiple new functions, such as an extra mode in which you can invite other players online to join you in your singleplayer storyline. It is also possible to design a new, custom character. The gameplay itself consists of a lot of small missions, that are activated through the storyline and places you travel to. The way photon is handled compared to the original has been changed. The photon points are now attached to characters instead of weapons and the photon charges have been removed altogether.</p>\n<p>Using the infrastructure mode an online party can be assembled through an internet connection.</p>",

The game takes place two years after the Second European War. The war has calmed down, but now there are rebel groups to fight against. These rebel groups are motivated through ethnic groups. </p>\n<p>The game is set at the Lanseal Military Academy, where you play Leon, the class leader. It is your task to motivate and plan the battles with your classmates. The game starts off with training at school and competitions between classes, but soon everyone also has to help out with fighting against the rebel group. </p>\n<p>The gameplay is mainly the same as the original <em>Valkyria Chronicles</em>. The game shifts between an strategic top-view field, where you can decide to move which unit. After an unit is selected, you play real-time in a 3rd-person view with this unit until it runs out of stamina and with a number of attacks.</p>",

The Prince is after the evil fire spirit Ahihud and his minions, who have murdered his family members and taken over his kingdom. The game is a combination of 3D side-view platforming and action. It also lets the player use a big amount of acrobatic skills, such as walking on walls and swinging on ledges. Additionally, there are a lot of puzzles in the game, mainly focusing on moving objects and trying to open locked doors. Some of them require special abilities gained by freeing the Sisters of Time. Every such spirit confers a different time-manipulating power on the player.</p>",

        "description": "<p>With <em>Rock Band Unplugged</em>, Harmonix' music series comes to a handheld platform for the first time. Based on the same gameplay concept of hitting scrolling notes on screen in time with the music, <em>Unplugged</em> adapts the concept for play via buttons instead of instrument controllers while retaining most playing modes and options present in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Rock+Band\">Rock Band</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/39411/rock-band-2/\">Rock Band 2</a>.</p>\n<p>The main playing mode is Tour mode, in which players create a band and tour through cities, playing setlists to gain fans, money and stars, unlocking new songs and venues in the process. Money can be spent to hire staff and outfit the band members in the in-game store. Unlocked songs can be played in Quick Play mode without the need to create a band.</p>\n<p>When playing a song, the player controls all four tracks: bass, drums, vocals and guitar. The four tracks are displayed side-by-side and can be moved between at will. Each consists of four note tracks, mapped to buttons on the left and right of the display. To make playing an entire song possible in this way, the concept of phrases is introduced. A phrase is a short piece on a single track. When all notes in a phrase are hit, the track continues to play on its own for a while. Completing a phrase increases the score multiplier and takes the pressure off the player since not all tracks are in need of playing at the same time. Failing phrases however can cause an instrument track to fail out and the performance to fail altogether in the end. To bring back failed instruments, the other instruments can employ Overdrive, which works the same way as in other games in the series: when a series of bright notes is hit, the Overdrive meter increases until it can be activated at the press of a button, increasing the score multiplier and bringing back bandmates. During solos, the track in question is automatically selected and the solo must be played in full, with phrases or switching not applying for its duration.</p>\n<p>Additional playing modes are available from sub-menus: in both, phrases do not appear. In Band Survival Mode, the crowd meter will continually drop for tracks not currently played. In Warmup mode, only the currently played track is of interest and can lead to failure if not enough notes are hit. Additional options in the menu allow the unlocking of all songs, disabling solos and a never-fail mode.</p>\n<p>The game features 41 licensed tracks (all master recordings) on-disc, most of which are re-used from the earlier games in the series. Nine tracks were all-new to the game and only became available as DLC for the console entries after a period of <em>Unplugged</em> exclusivity. A further 57 tracks for <em>Unplugged</em> were made available as DLC via PSN through an in-game store during 2009.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Marvel Nemesis</em>, the game that has Marvel Comics' greatest superheroes face off against Electronic Arts' newly created Imperfects, comes to the PSP as a pure fighting game without the story mode of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/19493/marvel-nemesis-rise-of-the-imperfects/\">console version</a>, but instead with its own modes, array of characters and a unique card collecting element.</p>\n<p>The main mode in the game is the Campaign. Two different campaigns are available: one for Marvel heroes, one for the Imperfects. Each consists of ten fights that have to be won in order. At the start of the game, only two characters can be selected: The Thing and Johnny Ohm. Completing a campaign unlocks another character, whose campaign completion unlocks another and so forth. Fighting through the campaign also unlocks further arenas. All in all, there are seven arenas, ten Marvel characters and eight Imperfects. Compared to the console version, the roster loses Daredevil and the Human Torch, but gains Dr. Doom and Captain America.</p>\n<p>Fights are best-of-three bouts and are mainly controlled via analog stick for movement and the PSP's four buttons, used for attacks, jumps, grabs/throws and locking on to the enemy/blocking. Characters with the appropriate superpower ability can use flight or teleportation via the left shoulder button while the right shoulder button is a context-sensitive superpower enhancer, enabling extra-powerful attacks and blocks, the details of which vary by character. Superpowers require the power meter to be charged. Both power and health recharge automatically. Landing a series of hits on the enemy increases the Rage Meter, that when full enables unlimited use of superpowers for a short while. The arenas include a lot of destructible terrain and objects for picking up and throwing.</p>\n<p>After a campaign fight is won, the player is first awarded a medal (gold, silver or bronze, depending on the length of the fight) and can then pick a collectible card from an assortment of five, all face down. Like in a collectible card game, these come in common, uncommon and rare varieties. It is more likely to get rarer cards with the better medals. They come in four basic categories: health, defense, power and strength. The cards can give bonuses during a fight, like increasing health or attack strength, faster recharge times, increased rage length, etc. There are also character-specific cards that can be used only with the character in question. In the game's card book, the cards can be grouped into decks, one of which can then be selected before a fight. In-game the cards are activated through the D-Pad. Only two card slots are available from the start, the other two have to be unlocked in the campaign. Combining certain sets of cards (like all character-specific cards) awards further bonuses. All in all, the game includes 173 cards (the count includes unlocked characters and arenas). Unwanted or duplicate cards can be traded in for other random cards with the recycling option, taking into account their rarity value.</p>\n<p>The game includes a Quickplay and an ad-hoc multiplayer mode which allows the use of unlocked characters, arenas and collected cards.</p>",

Besides the expected ATV (all-terrain vehicles) there are also a variety of other vehicles to race with, e.g. trucks or bikes, which is the foundation of the career mode: participating in a string of championships which are divided in vehicle type and difficulty. Upgrades and additional vehicles are purchased with credits which can be earned in a number of ways: besides price money for winning races, credits are also awarded for performing stunts. There are also three sponsors which offer free upgrades and/or credits for fulfilling their demands regarding performance and stunt rating, but they should be hired with caution because a big penalty is assigned for missed goals. The available types of races are Supercross, Rallycross, National, Freestyle, Circuit, Endurcross, Rally and Snowcross.</p>\n<p>Besides a basic course editor and multiplayer for up to four players (which is also the maximum number of racers in single-player) there are also connectivity features with <em>ATV Offroad Fury 4</em> which allow to exchange courses/vehicles and access a shared online community.</p>",

Murders occurred at summer night and are named the \"crossbow murders\". Victims are found clutching the photos of women in bikinis in their hand. You will have to find the murder by using your deductive skill as well as track him or her down, and tear down the alibi that seems to be the backbone of a perfect crime.</p>\n<p>The game with the same title was released for 3DO in 1994 which used live-cast and photo backdrops, whereas this version does not and instead use silhouette-like characters and CG backgrounds. This is not a remake of 3DO version, just a different way of telling the same story.</p>",

Unlike the original game, which focused specifically on characters from <em>The King of Fighters</em>, this game includes characters from across SNK's library.</p>\n<p><em>NeoGeo Heroes</em> plays similarly to Moss's other character-based vertical shooting games, such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/165107/caladrius/\">Caladrius</a>. Each of the ten different playable characters features a unique playstyle and shot pattern. New to this game is a new \"burst\" mode. Players build up their burst meter over time, and are able to keep up to three stocks. Each character has a set of unique special moves which consume varying levels of burst meter, leading to each character having very distinct playstyles.</p>\n<p>The 15-stage main story mode is similar to <em>Sky Stage</em>'s branching story mode, but features a few new stages in addition to stages returning from the previous game. Players can also play a straight port of <em>Sky Stage</em> with its original six characters. <em>Sky Stage</em>'s multiplayer minigames also return unaltered. A new challenge mode gives players specific sets of tasks to complete, with rewards for filling them out. Additionally, there is a new museum mode that lets players read about all of the included characters, look at concept artwork, and listen to music.</p>\n<p>The six characters from <em>Sky Stage</em> return (Kyo Kusanagi, Iori Yagami, Terry Bogard, Athena Asamiya, Kula Diamond, Mai Shiranui) alongside four new characters: Akari Ichijo (<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/17456/the-last-blade/\">The Last Blade</a>), Marco Rossi (<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5005/metal-slug-super-vehicle-001/\">Metal Slug</a>), Iroha (<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/44160/samurai-shodown-vi/\">Samurai Shodown VI</a>), and UNI-008 (<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/13015/alpha-mission/\">Alpha Mission</a>).</p>",

You enter your name, date of birth, and your favourite music style. You then choose one of the three available female characters that will guide you through the game. The player then gets to access the Cover Girl magazine where the content is customized based on a number of questions. The game for instance asks you whether numbers or letters attempt you more, if you are in the mood for food choices or to release your inner child, and if you are more interested in being dressed to kill than deadweight dumping. The game then generates a Cover Girl magazine based on your preferences.</p>\n<p>As a digital magazine the player can then read articles about the behaviour of men, horoscopes, recipes, do a tarot session, answer questions in a sex-o-meter quiz, consult the Manlation to get to know the behaviour of men, complete a Purse-onality quiz to find the perfect purse or do Sudoku puzzles. After going through a number of items a new issue becomes available with new content based on the same themes. It also includes a size translator to compare and convert the different clothes and shoes sizes around the world. There are 25 mini-games in total and over 100 quizzes. Additional magazines were unlocked afterwards and made available through the PlayStation Store.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Nayuta no Kiseki</em> is an action RPG that doesn't continue the existing <em>Kiseki</em> game series, drops out <em>The Legend of Heroes</em> title prefix and creates a whole new world and characters with a whole new <em>Kiseki</em> game. The protagonist of the story is Nayuta Herschel, a young man whose hometown, Remnant Island, is a part of Lost Heaven world. Nayuta's passion is astrology and his aspiration is to go into the world and explore as much of it as he can, solving the world's mysteries on his journey into the unknown. For some time now, a strange phenomenon is occurring around the Remnant Island, shooting stars and debris are falling from the sky and into the surrounding sea. In one of the latest incident, a huge chunk of debris falls not far off the island coast, and Nayuta, along with his friend Signa, goes into what seems like a fallen tower to explore it. Inside they find Noi, a pink-haired fairy-tale who teams up with Nayuta. This fateful meeting is just the beginning of their long and mysterious journey together. When you are not adventuring around exploring lands and towns, visiting shops or talking to other characters, you will find yourself engaged in battle with random enemies and eventually bosses. Basic actions during battle are sword skills, art of magic, and gear craft which gives you special abilities.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Madden series makes its first appearance on the PSP with <em>Madden NFL 06</em>. Based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/18905/madden-nfl-06/\">concurrent console version</a>, it adapts some of its modes for play on the handheld, removes others, and adds some unique features, including several mini games.</p>\n<p>Gameplay modes include exhibition games, wireless head-to-head play (online or ad-hoc), practice, and franchise. Modes and features that have not made it over from the consoles include owner mode, superstar mode, Madden Cards, creating teams, or the ability to challenge plays. The new gameplay features QB vision or hit stick (due to lack of a second analog stick) are not in the PSP version either, but precision passing has made the cut. The game also features connectivity to the PS2 version: it is possible to transfer franchise games from PS2 to PSP and vice versa, allowing one to play one set of games at home and another on the road, with results available on both systems.</p>\n<p>The Mini Camp mode from the console version has been expanded and features ten exclusive mini-games, playable either on their own or in a competition. Another PSP-exclusive feature is an assistant coach mode.</p>",

Closely based on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/73186/madden-nfl-06/\">previous year's iteration</a>, it has the usual roster updates, improved loading times, and some new features.</p>\n<p>The game adds some of the new control options introduced in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/29006/madden-nfl-07/\">console</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/73298/madden-nfl-07/\">versions</a>, including the Hit Stick (toggled on the PSP via the triangle button) and Lead Blocker Control. The main game modes are unchanged from the previous year and include \"play now\" quick games, wi-fi multiplayer, mini-camp and franchise (still without Owner Mode or Storyline Central, but with the exclusive Assistant Coach mode). The PS2 connectivity option now allows to transfer entire franchise seasons between PSP and PS2. A new addition is the mini game \"End 2 End\". In this mode, the PSP is held vertically. A runner moves towards the end zone and faces a number of tacklers. Upon noticing the direction the tackler is going in, the player must respond by hitting the correct direction button in time to evade. Score is given for quick reaction and multiple evasions in a row. Reaching high scores in this mode unlocks music tracks and hidden teams.</p>",

Regarding modes and options, it is very similar to its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/73370/madden-nfl-08/\">predecessor</a>. Besides the usual roster updates, it introduces several features designed to make the game easier for beginners.</p>\n<p>All game modes of the previous year return: play now, franchise, mini-camp, practice and Superstar Challenge. The challenges have been updated and now feature situations from the 2007 season. The game introduces a Rookie Mode, which simplifies controls, reducing them to a few buttons, and also introduces prompts indicating what to press when. Also considering new players, the playcalling system has been redesigned and features basic and advanced options. Another new feature is a new defensive camera, which in a break from most football games has the camera behind the defensive line, with the offense moving toward the screen.</p>",

The game features all the modes of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/73405/madden-nfl-09/\">previous version</a>, and also adds several new features.</p>\n<p>Returning game modes include play now, franchise, mini-camp and practice. Superstar Challenge mode also returns (with all-new situations from the 2008 season), but offers an additional twist: in addition to playing the \"Hero\", players can also play the \"Spoiler\" and prevent the historical moments from happening. A play designer has been added that allows players to create plays and formations for use in the game's playbooks. Created plays can be uploaded to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/59861/madden-nfl-10/\">PS3 version</a>.</p>\n<p>On the field, a mini-game for fumble recovery has been added, similar to the one seen in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/59861/madden-nfl-10/\">other</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/73505/madden-nfl-10/\">versions</a>: when during a fumble, both teams are in range of the ball, who gains possession is decided by a quick-time event, requiring both mashing of buttons and hitting the correct buttons in sequence. Another addition is a player momentum system: depending on their performance during a game, individual players have hot or cold streaks, influencing their further performance. The game also features newly-recorded commentary by Tom Hammond and Cris Collinsworth.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The story takes place in year 2050 and centers on Youichi Hinata, a high-school student who lost his parents in a tragic accident. Constantly hanging out with his close, yet eccentric buddy, Ginga Amamiya, the two of them are working on a project to make a rocket and launch it all the way to the moon. Foolish task for the kids, but they're serious about it in their own way. One peaceful night, while Youichi was on the phone with his childhood friend, Asuka, talking about the stars, he noticed a falling star. Not thinking too much of it at the time, after the phone call he noticed there was something different about it. It wasn't a falling star... it was something else, and it fell down nearby. He went out in the dead of night to try to locate the fallen object. On his way there, he run into Ginga and the two of them approached the park where instead of a fallen meteor, they saw a small spaceship. Not sure what sort of alien they might encounter, or if it's even alive, they opened the hatch only to see a dazed girl in place of a pilot. Seeing how Youichi is living alone, and until they figure out what to do next, they decide that Youichi should take her in for the time being. And thus the story of Youichi and Aries begins.</p>\n<p>The story is presented in two different timelines. The present time in 2050, and two years prior the accident, in 2048. The game contains all the expected gameplay features to be found in a visual novel, such as message log with ability to skip to previous scenes or replay dialogues, quicksave and quickload options as we as regular save option with up to 99 slots, the ability to remove the text to see the clear background picture, and bonus galleries and music player. The PSP port main differences in comparison to the original release is that it has full voice-acting for non-player characters, additional episode that extends the story, and many new CG events making this port contain three times the original.</p>\n<p>Originally released as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Himawari\">Himawari</a> for PC (Windows) in 2007 as adult visual novel, in 2010 the port to PSP got renamed to <em>Himawari: Pebble in the Sky Portable</em>. In 2011, the game got released on iOS and Android devices through three chapters, which included a bonus fandisk episode called <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Himawari:+Aqua+After\">Himawari: Aqua After</a>. In 2012, both iOS and Android releases stopped existing as separate chapters and were integrated in a single all-chapter releases. In 2015, the PSP version was ported to PSVita as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Himawari:+Pebble+in+the+Sky\">Himawari: Pebble in the Sky</a> which included more additional content.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Kokoro Connect</em> is a non-adult visual novel that originated on PSP, based on the manga and anime TV series with the same name, but featuring original scenario. This story focuses on five lead characters: Iori Nagase, Himeko Inaba, Taichi Yaegashi, Yoshifumi Aoki, and Yui Kiriyama, with scenario and full voice-acting for each of them, including the protagonist. The player takes a role of Taichi Yaegashi, a student in a Shiritsuyamahoshi (\u79c1\u7acb\u5c71\u661f) high-school, and a member of a Culture Research Club. After a strange incident with cardiospermum halicacabum plant, the member of the Culture Research Club started to experience strange premonitions. During those premonitions, they would appear at the random place, with the random people at random time, often finding themselves in a situation very different from their reality.</p>\n<p>During the course of the story, point of view jumps from character to character, and their actions and choices branch the story toward one of the multiple endings. The game also features story graph which shows you which direction you took, where did you story branch, and at which point in the story you currently are. Events in the story can be re-played with the point of view from multiple characters. Aside from that, the bulk of the game still consists of the same elements that make a visual novel game what it is... visual (CG events with anime character art on top of background location art) and novel (text window during storytelling and fully voice-acted dialogues). Unlockable bonus content such as event scene galleries and music player, can be accessed via main menu.</p>\n<p>This initial retail release, unlike the digital release, comes with several bonuses inside the package:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Voucher for downloading 10 PSP themes and a playable bonus scenario </li>\n<li>Culture Research Club newspaper (two-sided A4 size)</li>\n<li>Collectible card featuring game character</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The voucher for downloading bonus content was valid only from October 18, 2012 until October 18, 2013.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Kouji Saitou (\u6589\u85e4 \u5149\u5fd7) is a private investigator who finds himself arrested for the murder he did not commit. What's more, he was pretty drunk when arrested and doesn't remember much around the time when the murder took place. Taken into detention, he needs to rely on other people to gather clues and prove his innocence. His girlfriend, Noriko Shinjou (\u65b0\u57ce \u6cd5\u5b50), while shocked at first, believes in his innocence and decides to help him find out more about the last night's events and keep him apprised.</p>\n<p>During dialogues with other characters you will be given clues which in turn you'll be able to use to present in order to prove your innocence during interrogation scenes. Interrogation scenes present a bar which can either deplete if you answer incorrectly or present irrelevant clues which will make you look guilty, or it will fill as you successfully answer the questions that will exonerate you. Words marked in green during dialogues can be selected to give you more background on what is meant by that. When controlling Noriko, you'll be able to talk to other characters like in visual novels, with ability to look around each room and interact with certain objects to gather more information and clues. The story progresses through days and you have a time limit of 23 days to exonerate yourself and find the real culprit.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Criminal Girls</em>, the player takes the role of a prison warden in Hell who has been assigned to a group of seven girls. Although these seven have all been damned to Hell for their sins in life, they qualify for an early release program in which they must climb a tower to earn a second chance in the realm of the living. However, they are defiant and rebellious, not wanting to do what they're told. The player must therefore whip the girls into shape, sometimes literally, in order to help them complete their rehabilitation. On their way up the tower, the girls must fight other prisoners in RPG-style battles.</p>\n<p>One of the main gameplay mechanics is Motivation, through which the girls learn new skills, gain the will to fight, and come to terms with their sins. It plays out as a minigame in which the player uses items such as whips and shock devices to destroy \"temptations\" that appear on the screen, after which they can cuddle with the girl. The minigame is accompanied by images of the chosen girl in suggestive poses.</p>",

It includes most of that game's modes (a cut-down selection of those from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/19347/fifa-soccer-06/\">console versions</a>), while updating teams and rosters, revising the controls and adding several new features, including an exclusive mini-game.</p>\n<p>The game includes teams from 25 leagues from 18 countries, along with assorted teams from the rest of the world and 40 international teams. Game modes include a play now option for friendlies and season and tournament play (each customizable). Challenges, a long-time staple of handheld entries in the series, also return, with 20 comeback and 20 rout challenges from the 2004-2005 season, the completion of which unlocks a custom challenge editor. Infrastructure multiplayer has been added in addition to the returning ad hoc mode.</p>\n<p>The exclusive mini-game is called juggling. Choosing from one of the included licensed players, the goal is to keep the ball in the air by bouncing it on legs and head. The game is played by holding the PSP sideways so the player is in full view. An icon indicates which of the directional buttons must be pressed while the ball is in the center of the icon. The game is played for high score, with higher playing levels increasing the difficulty.</p>\n<p>Controls during regular gameplay have been refined. In particular, the First Touch and Freestyle controls are no longer mapped to the directional pad but instead to the analog stick with the shoulder button as modifier.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>FIFA Soccer 07</em> is the third appearance of the soccer series on the PSP. It builds upon the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/79309/fifa-soccer-06/\">previous year's version</a> with updated rosters, new control options and new game modes.</p>\n<p>The game includes 27 leagues from 20 countries (adding the Turkish league), plus various rest-of-the-world and international teams, the same selection as in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/25508/fifa-soccer-07/\">console version</a>. Returning modes include Kick-Off for friendlies, tournaments and challenges (with 31 new comeback and 30 new rout challenges) and wi-fi multiplayer (ad-hoc and infrastructure). The manager mode, already an established feature in the console versions, makes its debut on the PSP in this game. It tasks players with managing a club team, taking care of sponsors, the club board, and fan relations in addition to success on the pitch. PSP manager careers are compatible with those from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/25508/fifa-soccer-07/\">PS2 version</a> and can be exchanged via PS2-PSP link. Exclusive to the PSP version is player training via mini-games (which are also available on their own): the returning Juggling and the new Wall Attack. In Wall Attack, the goal is to kick the ball at a wall of colored blocks for points, with a certain number necessary within a time limit to advance to the next level. Some blocks contain icons that have additional effects, like clearing neighboring blocks or blocks of the same color.</p>\n<p>Among the new control options are chip shots and various new configurations: there is a choice between player control via analog stick or d-pad (or both, but without on-the-fly tactics changes) and optional <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pro+Evolution+Soccer\">PES</a>-style button layout.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The classic puzzle series comes to the PSP as a launch window title with <em>Puzzle Bobble Pocket</em>.</p>\n<p>Gameplay follows the standard formula: the player controls a catapult at the bottom of the play field that shoots bubbles of random colors. When three or more bubbles of the same color touch, they are removed from the field. After a while, the existing bubbles are pushed down into the play field by a descending ceiling or by more bubbles being added from the top. The game is lost when the bubbles reach the bottom. Special bubbles include explosive ones that destroy bubbles they touch, bowling balls that knock off all bubbles in their path, star bubbles that remove all bubbles of the same color as the bubble they are touched by, and rainbow bubbles that change color into the color of a bubble group that gets popped adjacent to them.</p>\n<p>There are four modes to choose from: Single, Endless, VS and Survival. Single is the classic single-player puzzle game, featuring 500 levels. The goal in each is to clear the pre-set pattern of bubbles. Endless is the unwinnable variant in which more bubbles are always pushed in from the top, played for high score. VS is the competitive variant played against a number of CPU opponents, where popping more than the required three bubbles sends them over to the opponent's field. Survival is a variant of the VS game: after winning a round, the own play field is not reset.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Gretzky NHL 06</em> for PSP is a hockey game endorsed by legendary player Wayne Gretzky. Released only six months after the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/35026/gretzky-nhl/\">previous PSP game</a>, this version comes with updated rosters and several features taken from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/35704/gretzky-nhl-06/\">PS2 version</a>, but has its own selection of modes.</p>\n<p>Returning modes include single games and a full season. The new chemistry feature makes its way over from the PS2, influencing players' stats depending on how well they interact with each other. Also seen on the PS2 is the \"Wayne vs Wayne\" mode, in which the two competing teams build up their \"99 meter\". When full, The Great One himself joins the team as an extra player for a short time. In addition to single games, this mode can also be played in the PSP-exclusive NHL Showdown mode, which is a ladder against all NHL teams, with the finale against a team of five Gretzkys. Another exclusive mode is called \"3 on 3 Countdown\". It is an arcade mode, with only three players per team on the field, without any of the regular rules, and the winner being the team that reaches a set score first.</p>\n<p>Online multiplayer, both ad hoc and via infrastructure, also return, as do the Gretzky Challenges: by earning points through in-game achievements, players can unlock bonuses like alternate and vintage uniforms and new gameplay features and modes. Unlike the previous PSP game, <em>Gretzky 06</em> features color and play-by-play commentary by Mike Emrick and Darren Pang.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ratatouille</em> is a 3D platform game based on the Pixar animated film of the same name. Unlike versions for <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/32995/disneypixar-ratatouille/\">other</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/80938/disneypixar-ratatouille/\">platforms</a>, the PSP game does not follow the plot of the film but instead presents its own story set after the film's climax, with the voice actors from the film reprising their roles for the game.</p>\n<p>Shortly before Linguini and Collete can open their new bistro, their recipes are stolen by their disgruntled ex-employer Skinner. It falls to gourmet rat Remy to bring back the recipes so the new restaurant can open in time.</p>\n<p>Remy must move through five worlds of six to seven levels each, accessible from the rat colony hub world. The worlds include Linguini's apartment, the sewers, the marketplace, Paris rooftops and the restaurant. In most levels, Remy's goal is to pick up the recipe that lies somewhere in a hard-to-reach place, but other levels consist only of races or boss fights and the recipe is awarded upon winning. To get around, Remy can jump and double-jump, pull himself up ledges, crouch and run on all fours to get into tight spaces, climb up vertical and swing along horizontal poles and also swim and dive. Some enemy critters like spiders, caterpillars and bats want to hinder Remy on his quest, but he can punch them or hit them with his tail to defeat them. Some small puzzles must be solved to overcome some obstacles, usually involving finding a certain object to be used at the correct place. The ghost of chef Gusteau usually offers hints on what to do next, and Remy's fellow rats also sometimes offer helpful advice.</p>\n<p>Lying about the levels are various collectibles. Apples and cupcakes restore lost health. Pieces of cheese function as currency and can be traded in with the merchant rat in the rat colony for upgrades: increasing Remy's health bar, adding more combat moves, increasing his swimming speed and more. Hidden in most levels are star keys. These can be used to unlock chests in the rat colony that contain additional recipes not found in the regular levels. Found recipes can be looked at in the game menu and contain actual cooking instructions for various dishes.</p>\n<p>The game also includes two multiplayer modes: a race and a cheese collecting game. The race optionally allows placing chili peppers on the track, the eating of which increases speed. The cheese collecting game has several variants. In the regular variant, the player who collects the most cheese within the time limit wins. The 'weighted' variant makes a player slow down upon collecting cheese. Putting the collected cheese into a designated drop area restores regular speed. In the 'chef hat' variant, hats materialize when five pieces of cheese have been collected, with the winner being the player who collects the required number of hats or the most hats after the time limit ends.</p>",

The protagonist of the story is a junior high-school student, Yukiteru Amano (\u5929\u91ce \u96ea\u8f1d). One morning, he located his future diary following a strange directions that appeared on his mobile phone. Upon reading a diary for a while, he stumbled on a paragraph describing his own death. Unknowingly, he ended up being pulled in a deadly game of survival by the future diary which has been changing owners, making Yukiteru the 13th owner.</p>\n<p>The game features original story in the series, written and supervised by the original manga author, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Esuno+Sakae\">Esuno Sakae</a>. During the game which mostly plays like a visual novel, various choices will lead to different ending, most of them bad, which requires replaying and a bit of luck to get the wanted outcome. The game also features character switching system which lets you select different character after each new entry in the diary which changes the course of the story.</p>\n<p>Original game came before the anime adaptation of the series and features no voice-acting, but the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Mirai+Nikki:+13-ninme+no+Shoy%C5%ABsha+-+Re:write\">Re:write</a> game version came out two years after, featuring several new features as well as full voice-acting by the same actors from the animated TV series.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Tenebrae</em> is a horror adventure set in a fictional futuristic place called New Island City where a huge incident occurred involving multiple people, some of whose stories the player can experience by playing through each of their perspectives. This game is a first out of planned but cancelled four episodes, and though each episode work as a standalone story, they all share the common core which helps bind the overall story.</p>\n<p>In this first episode, the story follows a reportage writer, Seiji Inugami (\u72ac\u4e0a \u5f81\u723e) who one evening receives a phone call prompting him that something big is going to happen in New Island City. While reluctant to take a commission to collect the data onsite at first, he ends up coerced into agreement by the caller who blackmails him with something from Seiji's past which he was part of 15 years ago where he witnessed something he shouldn't have. On his way to the city, he ends up meeting his old friend, police detective Kaoru Saegusa who is working on a case involving a series of disappearances. While friendly chatting, they hear what sounds like a sea of screams in the distance. As they look toward it, they see a huge black fog enveloping the area. Thus, the search for answers and uncovering the mystery behind it begins.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Unlike the original game, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/100732/akb148-idol-to-koishitara/\">AKB1/48: Idol to Koishitara...</a>, released a year earlier, this game is sort of a dream where each of the AKB48 idols are in love with you, but you're only be able to select and profess your love to one of them in the end. AKB48 (AKB is abbreviation of Akihabara, an electronic town in Tokyo) is a j-pop idol group with, yes, you guessed it, 48 members in total. Members aren't constant and their popularity is based on votes by the fans of the group. As the title implies, the game takes place in the island of Guam, and idols will wear bikinis a lot, and regular clothes lot less.</p>\n<p>The game mostly plays like a visual novel which user real-life locations and actual idols in various poses over the background image instead of anime art. The setting itself is not the only thing differing from the first game. This game features new poses and photo shots with different clothes (the more showing kind) and re-recorded voice-acting by AKB48 members for the new scenario. The game progresses one day at the time where you spend with one of the idols, either on a date or in casual talk. The player is given a list of letters sent to you by AKB48 girls with their profiles. Based on who sent you the message, you can reply to it which eventually leads you to a date with that person. You can use the phone to call the person of interest and set a date. During the date part which plays as a visual novel, there will be a dialogue selection which will show the girl you're with if you're rude, indifferent or like her. This in turn may prompt her to contact you again at the beginning of the next day. Some correspondence occurs irregularly when the girl liked how she felt when she was with you on previous dates. Likewise, addresses of the girls you were rude with will disappear from the list until only one remains. Initially, all 48 girls are listed as your potential girlfriends. During special so called escort event scenes, idols will wear a special bikini and pose jut for you. Any event scene during visual novel gameplay lets on-screen text be toggled off and allows for certain amount of zooming.</p>\n<p>Various unlockables such as visual cards, event scenes, and steel photos can accessed from the menu, while collected cards can be traded with other players. AKB48 soundtrack does not need to be unlocked and can be listened via BGM player. It additionally lets the player select default BGM song and theme song for each of the ABK48 members.</p>\n<p>Initial first print retail release comes with a photo (random one out of 48) of one of the AKB48 members.</p>",

As is the case with earlier games in the series, <em>Blood: The Last Vampire</em> features full voice-acting and plays non-stop as a regular TV anime with player choices which need to be selected in a time limit of only a couple of seconds and result in story branching or slight alteration of the events. The game has multiple endings and by re-playing it, more choices and ending get unlocked. There is a flowchart show the overall story progress and taken routes so replaying does not become repetitive.</p>\n<p>The PSP release of <em>Blood: The Last Vampire</em> is a compilation of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Blood:+The+Last+Vampire:+Joukan\">first (\u4e0a\u5dfb)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Blood:+The+Last+Vampire:+Gekan\">last volume (\u4e0b\u5dfb)</a> which were released as two separate games for PlayStation 2. In addition the PSP release has doubled the CG gallery and also includes special movie edits for each of the three heroines which can be unlocked by completing the game.</p>\n<p>Based on the manga and anime movie with the same title, this game focuses on the story set in Tokyo a couple of decades after the original series. While the anime and game stories don't have direct connection, the game setting is based on the same world as in the original series. While Saya is the protagonist of the original story, this story features a young boy who is a high-school student, as the protagonist. One day, while riding a subway, he experiences the strangest sensation... he starts hearing a demonic voice that no one else can hear. This soon starts to affect his daily life and drive him towards madness, but then Saya, the last remaining original vampire enters his life.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>EyePet</em> is a pet simulation game with minigames and customization. Modeled after the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=eyepet\">original PS3 game</a> it changes a few things for the portable format. The game requires a PSP camera and a \"magic card\" (included within the game package) to play. By pointing the PSP with the camera attached on the magic card the player makes the cute creature appear on screen. The player can play a variety of games with the pet, such as bowling, fishing or jumping on trampolines. The game encourages playing in different environments; by doing so the player has a chance of finding \"treasures\" - customization items. In a separate in-game area called Pet home the player may take care of the pet - feed it, wash it etc. and also change its appearance to their liking.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>AKB1/48: Idol to Koishitara...</em> is a romance adventure game featuring all the girls from AKB48 pop idol group. The story begins in a dreamlike situation where all the girls are in love with you, but in the end, you will have to choose only one. AKB48 (AKB is abbreviation of Akihabara, an electronic town in Tokyo) is a j-pop idol group with 48 members in total. Members aren't constant and their popularity is based on votes by the fans of the group. This is the first game in the series and takes place in Tokyo (background images during visual-novel style gameplay are photos from various known locations in Tokyo).</p>\n<p>The game mostly plays like a visual novel which features real-life locations and actual idols in various poses over the background image instead of anime art. The game progresses one day at the time where you spend with one of the idols, either on a date or in casual talk. The player is given a list of letters sent to you by AKB48 girls with their profiles. Based on who sent you the message, you can reply to it which eventually leads you to a date with that person. You can use the phone to call the person of interest and set a date. During the date part which plays as a visual novel, there will be a dialogue selection which will show the girl you're with if you're rude, indifferent or like her. This in turn may prompt her to contact you again at the beginning of the next day. Some correspondence occurs irregularly when the girl liked how she felt when she was with you on previous dates. Likewise, addresses of the girls you were rude with will disappear from the list until only one remains. Initially, all 48 girls are listed as your potential girlfriends. During special so called escort event scenes, idols will wear a special outfit just for you. Any event scene during visual novel gameplay lets on-screen text be toggled off and allows for certain amount of zooming.</p>\n<p>Various unlockables such as visual cards, event scenes, and steel photos can accessed from the menu, while collected cards can be traded with other players. AKB48 soundtrack does not need to be unlocked and can be listened via BGM player. It additionally lets the player select default BGM song and theme song for each of the ABK48 members. Voice-acting for each of the AKB48 girls in the game is done by AKB48 members.</p>",

Naoya, the protagonist, Ayano, and Yuichi have been close friends during their high school days. But one day, Yuichi fell to his death from the roof of a high school building. Five years have passed since that day, and Naoya has moved and is regular salary man. During summer holidays, he returns to his hometown and reunites with Ayano who has a memory problem in a way that she can only remember 15 minutes of the time the two of them met. Together, they reminisce and try to recall their high school days which in turn may also shed some light into Yuichi's untimely death. Beside the story mode, the game also has so-called fragment mode which slowly gets unlocked with new memory fragments as the player unfolds the main story scenario. The library, accessible via main menu, contains various bonuses and unlockables, namely memory scenes, CG gallery, and a music player.</p>",

Haruka (Red Angel) and Aoi (Blue Angel) are just a couple of regular students who at first sight seem like any other girls at their school campus. But in secret, they are \"Kaitou Tenshi Twin Angel\" heroines of justice, fighting Black Trader, the leader of a dark organization. In their last exploits, they managed to destroy the deadly satellite weapon and defeat Black Trader. Upon returning back to peaceful school life again, they were shocked to find out that someone stole a treasure relic known as \"Angel's Tear\". Deciding to find the culprit and recover the stolen treasure will lead them through a maze or intrigues and conspiracies.</p>\n<p>During dialogues gameplay resembles that of a typical visual novel, while the battles play as slot system where characters are fully visible on the screen with slot machine using one of the pre-set buttons to stop it and score three of the same images to deliver powerful blow. The game also features various unlockables such as music tracks, CG event scenes, or movies, which are accessible from main menu.</p>",

The setting takes place in a Southern Cross high school on a fictional Southern Cross island, same as in the anime, where the protagonist, named by the player, ends up entangled in controlling Cybodies and fighting opposition in Zero Time dimension. The game story branches based on player's choices, and the story itself is not written as new scenario or same scenario as the anime, but instead, an \"if\" scenario which lets the player alter the original story as if the game's new protagonist was there in the original anime. During even scenes the game sometimes switches to so-called kinship mode where you can get more intimate with the heroines of your choice. While in that mode, the gameplay screen turns to portrait mode, unlike the rest of the game which is using landscape mode.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A mother tells her son a tale of their ancestors battling monsters known as the Teras Pharma almost a century ago and that the monsters are due to return every hundred years. This tale inspired the young boy to grow up as a swordsman so he'd be prepared to fight these monsters when the time came. On top of having to worry about the Teras Pharma, there is also trouble brewing between the Ionian Empire and those who they deem as rebels. the Vermilion Axe.</p>\n<p>One day the young man was out with his friends, the siblings Myrna and Zeno, when they get attacked by some hostile creatures. Fleeing from the monsters they find a hiding place where they are then met by a young man named Xephon. Xephon hands them a mysterious object and when they are told to touch a tree they are then transported back in time where they meet their ancestors who want to travel to the present time to help rid that future world of the incoming Teras Pharma. However the ancestors are not able to transport to the future time so the young swordsman asks his ancestors to take him under their wing and train him so he can rid the world of the Teras Pharma.</p>\n<p><em>Genso Suikoden: Tsumugareshi Hyakunen no Toki</em> is a Suikoden game taking place in a universe outside the main canon Suikoden series, The game doesn't have random encounters as the player can see the enemies on screen and can usually choose when they want to enter into a turn based battle with an enemy or not. The turned based battle system retains the six party member standard of the earlier Suikoden games. In battle, the six party members can be placed in either the front, middle,or back row.with up to three characters per row. The game also offers a rudimentary job class system. For example, if the player wants to use a healing spell they will need a character who is a herbalist The nine main jobs are Spearman, Martialist, Swordsman, Archer, Ninja, Herbalist Jongleur, Magician and Shaman.  It's also possible for a character of one class to teach a character a skill of the same class (ie. A swordsman can teach another swordsman any skills they have learned). Most characters can also learn one additional job class from another party member which are unlocked through a character friendship system that involves characters dining together repeatedly.</p>\n<p>Like in the other Suikoden games, the game lets the player try to recruit 108 characters to their forces. However only 18 characters will become the main playable party members. The rest either teach skills or are workers at the castle headquarters. Towns in this game are explored through menus instead of physically walked through.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Scarface: Money. Power. Respect.</em> is a turn-based strategy game based on the 1983 movie <em>Scarface</em>. Players need to manage their drugs business and expand their turf to rule and expand the drug trade in Miami, just like the movie. The game can be played in a single-player mode, either as scenarios from the movie or as a cartel challenge managing one of several unlockable cartels. Each scenario has different objectives such as gathering wealth, building a certain amount of structures or taking over rivals. Usually there is a main goal with several, optional secondary goals. The movie scenarios are interspersed with clips from the movie.</p>\n<p>Most of the game is played on a single, fixed-screen where a map of the environment is shown, divided into different turfs with colours signalling whom it belongs to. Players interact through different menu structures as each round goes to three phases. The buy phase is used to hire thugs to fight or pushers to distribute, while constructing buildings such as labs and warehouses. Next is the power moves. These are advantages that can be bought in the areas of combat, drugs and law to influence the odds and apply pressure. The final planning phase is the dealing phase where the drugs is sold, based on the pushers and the structures of the first phase. This is done by going through the available turfs and determining where and what to sell (cocaine, heroin, pot) and which amount.</p>\n<p>There is also a combat phase to the game as a final step as players decide to either invade a neighboring cartel or defend. Unlike the rest of the game the execution of the combat phase is shown in a full 3D environment showing the fighting thugs as the camera swings around automatically to show the action. The combat is turn-based and player interaction is limited to attacking, defending or using power moves. Power moves can turn around a disadvantageous position for instance by providing grenade launchers or hiring snipers. Other option are setting car bombs, killing reinforcements or preventing the enemy from calling in reinforcements. In the planning phase it also possible to offer an alliance to a rival player.</p>\n<p>The multiplayer gameplay is similar, but played between friends each representing a different cartel. Each cartel is different based on three statistics. Like in the single-player cartel challenges it starts with players taking turns selecting the different turfs on the map at the start of the game.</p>",

It is played as a turn-based strategy game played as a American football-style fantasy sports title and is different from the releases for other platforms. You control a team of sixteen players, of which eleven are allowed on the pitch at any time. The goal is to get the ball over your opponent's touchdown line either by running it into the end zone or throwing it to someone who catches it there. There are eight races each with their own units and tactics: Chaos, Dwarf, Goblin, Human, Lizardmen, Orc, Skaven and Wood Elf.</p>\n<p>The single-player game modes include a Quick Game option using 56 pre-set teams, and the main Championship option which has you playing your way through fifteen tournaments. The multi-player game modes are Wireless/Ad-Hoc two-player games or a Hotseat mode where both player share a single device taking turns. As you do this, you build up your own team of unique players, which you can save out for local Wi-Fi head-to-head multiplayer or Cup and League games against the computer.</p>\n<p>In addition, inducements allow you to set up dirty tactics for the match. Using your cash you can bribe refs to gain extra dice rolls. Potions can be bought, which are Blood Bowl\u2019s version of drugs, and to give yourself bonuses you can hire crowds to cheer for you. All these affect the outcome of dice rolls.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dai-2-ji Super Robot Taisen Z Saisei-hen</em> is the second part of the sequel to the 2008 PS2 title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Super+Robot+Wars+Z\">Super Robot Wars Z</a> following the first part <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dai-2-Ji+Super+Robot+Taisen+Z+Hakai-hen\">Dai-2-Ji Super Robot Taisen Z Hakai-hen</a>.</p>\n<p>Despite the efforts of our heroes to end terrorist activity and all conflict on Earth in the first game, the Dimensional Monsters, rampaging hordes that destroy everything in their path, have been spawning more and more. Meanwhile, the new world order, established under the Earth Federation and its elite forces, the A-LAWS (from <em>Mobile Suit Gundam 00 Second Season</em>), shows no mercy to any dissident groups or rogue nations. A rebellion is brewing across the entire globe, as humanity tries to solve the crisis. Crow Burst, after witnessing the return of the Dimensional Monsters (as well as a new debt that he has to pay off), he embarks on a quest that will instigate a worldwide rebellion, and, potentially, get to the bottom of this prolonged conflict.</p>\n<p>This game continues the story from <em>Dai-2-Ji Super Robot Taisen Z Hakai-hen</em>. The game allows players to import their character and their completed save file to gain money bonuses as well as the opportunity to unlock secret levels, in a similar fashion to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Super+Robot+Taisen:+Compact+2\">Super Robot Taisen: Compact 2</a> for the WonderSwan. It features a longer campaign than the previous part (60 levels compared to 50 in the previous game). The gameplay and its system, however, is pretty much the same as the previous part.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Dark forces that threatened to destroy the world of La Gias have rescinded, if only for a brief. While the conflicts have been resolved, the Holy Kingdom of Langran is facing another war, this time with a new force: The Republic of Baronia. Forging an alliance with a long-time enemy of Langran, their goal is simple: to see the kingdom burn. In the midst of this new, twisted conflict, Masaki And\u014d and his team of Elemental Lords become independent from their previous masters, and form their own force to combat threats that can ravage the world of La Gias. Now, they venture out to find out what caused this new conflict to erupt.</p>\n<p>After 16 years, the original Masou Kishin game finally receives a sequel. Like its predecessor and most of the games in the long-running <em>Super Robot Wars/Taisen</em> franchise, the game is a tactical RPG in a science-fantasy setting. Players control characters that pilot \"Elemental Lords\", robots with magical powers, powered by their pilot's pr\u0101na, or life force. The main objectives are to defeat enemies and progress through the story, often with branching paths that can impact the final outcome.</p>\n<p>Once again, the terrain plays an important role in tactics. Terrain differences, as well as unit positions can impact the outcome of a battle. Units that attack other units from side or from back deal greater damage. While the combat system remains relatively unchanged, few elements were added from the main <em>Super Robot Wars/Taisen</em> franchise. For example, combined attacks to the enemy are now possible and they net both the main attacker and their partner experience points. Another one is the addition of assist attacks and defenses. If an allied unit possesses such skills, they can assist their friendly units when they are adjacent to them. However, their use is limited and so must be used wisely.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>R-Type Tactics II: Operation Bitter Chocolate</em> is a turn-based strategy tactical role-playing game and the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=R-Type+Tactics\">R-Type Tactics</a> as a spin-off of the main <em>R-Type</em> 2D side-scrolling arcade shooter series. The levels are structured as a side-scrolling shooter and the units of the two factions are placed on both sides of the hexagonal field. The fields are often larger than in the first game, can take place in large space facilities, and some of them have vertically scrolling stages. The opponents take turns instructing the units, with an important element that units cannot be turned around and can only attack in the direction they face. Not all matches have the player start on the left.</p>\n<p>At the start of the game the player creates a custom commander based on a number of parameters (gender, silhouette, birth place, favorite color, favorite food) and then takes on one of the three campaigns. Each campaign is based on a different faction. There is the first human faction, EAAF (Earth Allied Armed Forces), as an evolution of the Earth Space Corps in the first game, the second human faction, Granzera Revolutionary Army (GZRA), entirely new for this game and hailing from a base in Mars, and the alien Bydo Empire. The two human campaigns need to be completed first. Profiles from the first game can be carried over and are used for the Bydo campaign.</p>\n<p>Each faction has different units and abilities. The EAAF, for instance, has chosen to develop Force weapons based on Bydo alien technology, while the opposing revolutionary GZRA faction warns against the dependency on alien technology and use techniques such as Capture, Jamming (fog of war as masking) and Sonar (reveal de-synched units moving in subspace) instead of Force. This conflict between the two human factions is the main storyline and the game takes place in MC 0074, ten years after the events of the first game. This game features branching mission paths unlocked through choices in the journal.</p>\n<p>The game contains more than 200 different units often from existing <em>R-Type</em> titles such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/15759/r-type-final/\">R-Type Final</a> and even <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/24351/in-the-hunt/\">In the Hunt</a>. Each unit has specific statistics based on movement options, fuel, move cost, evasion rate, ammo, power, range, accuracy and so on. There are also unique abilities for base movement and attacks. Long-lasting units earn veterancy levels, which improve hit points or evasion levels. The EAAF's Force units are controlled separately or can attach themselves to other crafts. Along the way, new abilities are acquired making new units and upgrades available. New units are also provided after completing specific objectives, usually capturing structures. Progress is shown on a technology tree and certain very strong upgrades are available through DLC. Not all battles are limited to attacks, certain units can build space stations with a complex module system of up to 30 elements such as turrets, radars, docking bays, etc. These modules are tied to core blocks and once when of those is destroyed the entire station blows up.</p>\n<p>Almost all units can eventually be unlocked, including those of other factions. Players can also choose to leave missions early, taking the spoils gathered so far to run. Multiplayer is supported in competitive matches over Wi-Fi next to a cooperative two-player mode using Game Sharing and an ad hoc connection.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Nendoroland, a world unlike our own. For years, the various characters have lived in peace and prosperity. However, one day, at a Nendoro Academy, an unknown event happens that causes people to become overflowing with sadness and anger. A lone heroine, Black Rock Shooter, along with other companions from all over their world, embark on a quest that will change their world forever.</p>\n<p><em>Nendoroid Generation</em> is a crossover Japanese RPG game, based on the toy line by Good Smile Company, that produces <em>SD</em> (super-deformed) or <em>chibi</em> versions of characters from popular anime, manga and game franchises. It is a straightforward Japanese RPG, with simple gameplay and mechanics. Players control their party of three characters: 2 main characters, divided into melee or ranged, and a \"performer\", that can help the party by giving stat boosts during a battle. Players control their party members, wander around levels, collect items, talk to people and complete quests that progress the story. Combat is initiated through random encounters. </p>\n<p>There are two interesting gimmicks to the genre. The first one is the \"crystal\" system. Crystals represent character's willpower. Each attack or move consumes some part of them. When they reach zero, characters suffer a \"crash\" and are incredibly vulnerable to enemy attack. To replenish them, performers can perform dances that give them the necessary energy to fight again. Another system is the costume system. By defeating enemies with an all-out attack, players receive costumes or other pieces of clothing that upgrades their party's stats, as well as provide a rich variety of customization. The game has a very lighthearted and humorous tone.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Football Manager Handheld 2012</em> is the PSP version of the annual <em>Football Manager</em> series and as with the PSP <em>Handheld</em> releases of the previous years, it offers a stripped-down experience of the main PC version. It is also different from the Android / iOS title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Football+Manager+Handheld+2012\">Football Manager Handheld 2012</a>, which has more content than this PSP version.</p>\n<p>The game offers control of a selection of 50 clubs from all over the world with some major ones, but not all squads are complete or entirely accurate. The basic simulation focuses on the team selection, trainings and preparations, transfers, contracts and scouting, and in-game tactics. Additional depth to the strategy is provided through a boardroom, and player and media interaction. At some stages the conversations and decisions can be steered by selecting from five options that influence the talks.</p>\n<p>The simulation of the games is provided through a 3D engine. Improvements are introduced through the interaction with the media, social networking, friendly games and international management.</p>",

The amount of force the ball is thrown with is determined by where the player stops a marker on a force meter.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mutajuice</em> is the first foray into game development by Korean CG animation studio Cinepix, known for the TV series <em>AquaKids</em> and <em>Cubix</em>. Taking place in a fantastical sci-fi world, it follows a member of OOPS - the Office of Planetary Security, a government branch responsible for defending Earth against alien invasions. Luckily they have the power of Mutajuice on their side, which enables them to pilot giant robots with incredible super powers. The protagonist ends up encountering enemies who plan to harness Mutajuice for their own evil ends, and so teams up with other OOPS heroes to battle them for the fate of the world. This interactive film is structured in the multiple-path adventure style, like 90s CD-ROM FMV games. Players have little interaction moment to moment; instead, the player's main impact comes in several different multiple-choice branching pathways that come up throughout the film, with the player's choice directing the story onto a new path. Based on the choices made, there are a number of different ways the story can play out and several different possible endings.</p>",

The game is set in a futuristic school where 128 people are fighting in a battle royale to get the Holy Grail and have their wish granted. The main character has lost their memories and is trying to uncover them and learn more about the world. The gameplay consists of running around talking to people in a visual novel style presentation and dialogue, gathering information about the other contestants and then moving into a dungeon crawling section where you fight enemies using a rock-paper-scissors combat and learning attack patterns of enemies to reveal their potential moves.</p>",
