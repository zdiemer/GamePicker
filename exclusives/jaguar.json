        "description": "<p><em>Cybermorph</em> was the first game released for Atari's Jaguar console. It's a 3D sci-fi shoot-'em-up. The story goes like this: The evil Pernitia Empire is swallowing up the galaxy's planets left and right. What's worse, the resistance forces have had their secret weapons stolen from them and put into pods spread out on many different planets. You must pilot the T-Griffon morphing attack craft to each planet and recover the pods to stop the Pernitians.</p>\n<p>So, in each planet, or level, you must collect a certain number of pods and make it to the exit before the enemies shoot you down. Fortunately, there are power-ups that can strategically enhance the T-Griffon's offensive capabilities. After clearing 8 planets, you take on a boss creature/ship before moving on to the next sector. There are 4 levels like this to clear, each with progressively increasing difficulty.</p>",

A ship infested with aliens is found floating near the outer-space training facility. Of course, once the aliens get inside the base, they kill off nearly everyone. Meanwhile, the predators dock their ship on the training base as well. They see this as an opportunity to catch an alien queen, and bring honor to their clan.</p>\n<p>So there are three scenarios in which to play: First, you can play as a marine. Your job is to find a way to self-destruct the base, and make your way to an escape pod before it blows. The second scenario allows you to play as an alien. Here, your job is to find and protect the queen from the marines and the predators. Finally, you can play as the predator. He must simply find and kill the alien queen.</p>\n<p>The game is a first person shooter. The play field consists of the five levels of the training base, plus areas for the predator and alien ships. All the areas of the ship are inter-connected, giving the game a huge virtual environment. Depending on the scenario you choose, you will have to choose different strategies based on the capabilities of your character. For example, the marine will have to make use of his weapons and his ability to use the ship's computer terminals. The aliens, on the other hand, will have to make use of their great numbers and ability to cocoon their enemies. And finally the predator must fight with honor, and not over-use his invisibility capability.</p>",

The game's design is similar to the earlier <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Power+Drive\">Power Drive</a> for 16-bit systems, however the circuit designs are different.</p>\n<p>The main game mode portrays a season of championship racing. There are several types of races that you will encounter. First, there is the special stage, which is a timed qualifying round. Second, there is the rally cross stage, in which you race against one other computer-controlled racer. Finally, there is the skill stage, where you have to perform a series of tricky driving maneuvers. After each round, you earn money for qualifying or winning. You can then use this money to repair your car, or save the money to purchase a new, faster car.</p>",

This Jaguar game features a port of the original game, and two updated versions: <em>Defender Plus</em> and <em>Defender 2000</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/140/defender/\">Defender</a> combines a side scrolling shooter with a search and rescue game. You control a ship that travels left and right above the planets surface. Alien lander craft warp into the play area, and begin to descend to the surface. Along the surface, there are humanoids ripe for the picking. The alien landers grab the humanoids and begin to carry them up the screen. You have to shoot the landers before they reach the top of the screen, and catch the humanoids before they fall to the surface.</p>\n<p>The <em>Defender Plus</em> update features gameplay that is very similar to the original, and graphics that have a crazy, psychedelic look. The <em>Defender 2000</em> update adds playfields that scroll in both directions, weapon power-ups, bonus rounds, improved graphics, and extremely high speed gameplay.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Missile Command 3D</em> is an update to the classic Atari arcade game. The goal in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Missile+Command\">Missile Command</a> is to defend your cities against an onslaught of missiles coming from the sky. Your arsenal consists of three anti-missile flak cannons. You have to position the anti-missile clouds in the path of the incoming missiles to stop them from impacting.</p>\n<p>This Jaguar game has 3 modes. First, there is a port of the original arcade game. There are neat extras for this mode like graphic backdrops and the ability to resize or scale the screen. The second mode is Missile Command 3D. This mode retains the gameplay of the original, but adds 3D graphics to the mix. The final mode, Virtual Missile Command, changes things up quite a lot. Instead of anti-missile flak, your cannons shoot lasers. This means you don't need to lead your targets anymore. You play the game from a first-person perspective, and must switch between the three cannons via buttons on the keypad. There are nine levels in this mode, each with a boss at the end.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Fight for Life</em> is a 3D fighting game that takes place in hell. The player controls one of eight deceased fighters competing to earn a chance to escape and return to the world of the living. After they defeat an opponent they not only move on to the next round, but also learn two of the opponent's moves.</p>\n<p>This is the only 3D fighting game released for the Jaguar. It features brightly-colored texture mapped fighters and arenas. Gameplay is very similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Virtua+Fighter\">Virtua Fighter</a>, in that the moves more-or-less look like real martial arts.</p>",

In each of the 21 levels, you must find all the data pods and make your way to the exit.

Levels are divided into simple, enclosed rooms, linearly connected by one-way teleporters.</p>\n<p>You can select a fast, medium, or heavy tank at the beginning of the game, with its abilities reflected in the strength of its guns or the amount of punishment it can absorb. Throughout the game, you will also find weapon power-ups and tank upgrades (such as shields, radar, and auto-targeting) to help you stay effective against the increasing numbers of enemy defenders. You can save your progress to the cart at the end of each level.</p>\n<p>Between levels are bonus rounds where you pilot your tank through a corridor and try to collect a set percentage of data pods. Meeting that percentage earns you an extra life.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Breakout 2000</em> is the Jaguar update to Atari's classic arcade game, Breakout. The premise in Breakout is to bounce a ball off a paddle into a series of blocks that disappear when struck. While the original Breakout, which is included with this release, has simple rectangles that represent the ball and paddle, Breakout 2000 has flashy pre-rendered 3D graphics.</p>\n<p>There are also a couple of gameplay enhancements over basic Breakout. First, the game can be played with two players. The second player has their own playfield at the top of the screen. They also have their own set of blocks to demolish, and can send their ball to the bottom playfield for the other player to hit. You can set either player to be computer controlled, so you can even watch the computer play against itself if you want. The other enhancement are the various power-ups that allow you to shoot the blocks out directly, catch the ball, and so on.</p>",

The old Iron Fist corporation is gone, and a new democratic republic has been set up. The peace is short lived, though. Iron Fist's rival, PENTA corporation, is now threatening the United Republic's stability. You are a pilot for the United Republic, and must stop PENTA's advances.</p>\n<p>Iron Soldier 2 plays similarly to the first game. You have new weapons, new enemies, and 20 super-challenging missions to contend with.</p>\n<p>Originally released on CD, Telegames later released a cartridge version, featuring the same gameplay as the CD version, but lacking music as well as having had the FMV sequences replaced with still images due to space constraints.</p>",

Inspired by the 1992 film about high stakes street basketball gambling, in this game you can wager how much you want on each game.</p>\n<p>The action is seen from the half court line, with a screen view that pans and zooms to follow the action. Aside from a goal tending penalty and the need to clear the ball, anything goes. For instance, steals are effected by shoving an opponent and making a grab for the ball.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to get enough money to enter, and win, the tournament. If you make $5000, you instantly get entered into the tournament. You have the ability to save your game in this mode so that you can come back later if you run short on time and don't want to lose all your money.</p>\n<p>Opt for a single game or the Slam City tournament, while game options determine time limits, scoring system, and control schemes. There are fifteen teams to choose from, and up to four players can get in on the action (with the Jaguar Team Tap adapter included with the game).</p>",

They meet in an arena in Sector 51, a spherical sector of space formerly used by the Earth government to secretly test new weapons and starships.

They meet in an arena in Sector 51, a spherical sector of space formerly used by the Earth government to secretly test new weapons and starships. The gameplay consists of 5 different play modes with different scenarios and goals. Choose from various starships (each with unique weapon systems) and battle the aliens, who have also chosen their best fighters and have many space ships of their own.</p>\n<p>The gold edition adds some new features. The game has better graphics and loads faster than the original release. New bonuses can be found during gameplay. A new ship and animations are also available.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Impulse X</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Breakout\">Breakout</a> variant based on the 1996 Atari Falcon game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/50263/impulse/\">Impulse</a> by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/10222/duranik/\">Duranik</a>. A paddle is controlled at the bottom of the screen to bounce a ball and destroy all the bricks on the field. Power-ups can be collected and you need to watch out for enemies as they can re-direct you ball in an angle you do not want.</p>\n<p>This Jaguar release supports rotary controllers and even mouse control (with the right adapter). It has a level editor to create custom levels and with the build-in BJL loader allows for the download of ram based levels from PC using a special cable.</p>",
