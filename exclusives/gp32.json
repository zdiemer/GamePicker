Princess Lemian is forced to marry a man she does not love. As she tries to escape from the unwanted wedding, she realizes that her path is blocked by soldiers. Her faithful knights arrive to fight them and help the princess escape.</p>\n<p>Unlike the preceding game, <em>All for the Princess</em> is a 2D side-scrolling beat-em-up. The player can choose to control any of the five available knights. There are too basic attacks - fast and strong. Combo attacks can be performing by combining these two with directional buttons. There are separate controls assigned to blocking ans evasive manoeuvres. The knights can also strafe backwards, while turning around is performed by pressing a separate button. Enemies usually drop health-restoring or stat-enhancing items when defeated.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The exams in Uleo Magic School are a little different from most... students must defeat the other students in magic duels in order to graduate! In this 2D fighting game, players take control of one of eight students, running the range from magicians to magical creatures, and aim to defeat them all in one-on-one combat. The core gameplay is typical 2D fighting, but in addition to their punch and kick buttons and special moves players can use magic spells; the L button switches the currently-selected spell and the R button casts it. While there's no cost to casting spells, their slow launch time makes them risky and encourages players to be strategic about using them. In addition to a standard one-player story mode, <em>Little Wizard</em> supports the GP32's wireless dongle for local multiplayer.</p>",
