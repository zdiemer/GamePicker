        "description": "<p><em>Lost World Pinball</em> is a dinosaur themed pinball game that consists of a single table. The game plays like other pinball games with two keys being used to control left and right flippers while a third has to be hold down to launch the ball. The player has three balls which has to be used to reach the highest score. The table consists of bumpers (10 points), red power strips (10 points), plungers (20 points) and red marks (30 points). Upon reaching 10,000 points an extra ball is given. Hitting all plungers lead to a 2x multiplier the first time and a 3x multiplier the second time.</p>\n<p>Next to the table is an animated picture of a volcano, a dinosaur and a prehistoric fly. It is possible to make the volcano erupt by having the dinosaur catch the fly with his tongue. The tongue grows larger when hitting red marks and for it to reach full length twelve hits are needed. When it erupts the playing ball disappears but will reappear ready to be launched again. The point values are then ten times their regular value.</p>",

This is done by entering the coordinates of the squares that the player wants to move between. After making jumps the player has to enter -1,-1 to end the move.

The game ends when the ground is all covered with eggs.</li>\n<li><em>Lunar Lander</em> is a simple version of a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/6716/lunar-lander-variants/\">Lander</a> game. A spacecraft is quickly descending and the player has to land it safely by achieving zero altitude at zero velocity. The game is played with the number keys which are used to apply thrust. Higher numbers release more thrust while lower ones release less.</li>\n<li><em>Horse Race</em> is a simple betting game. Five horses are lined up and upon the press of a button they begin running.
