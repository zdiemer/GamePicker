Like the original version of <em>Universe Sandbox</em>, this version also presents itself as a realistic simulation of the universe and puts the player in complete control of its stars, planets and moons. The player can customize the mass, density, motion, composition, climate, and appearance of planets and watch how the changes affect the planet's relationship with its celestial neighbors\u2014or, if they want a more extreme result, they can just fling them into other objects and watch them collide. The player can also change the temperature of the sun and create supermassive black holes to cause further destruction.</p>",

The Porgs appear in the player's surroundings accompanied by a device projecting a hologram of the android C-3PO (voiced by returning actor <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/32702/anthony-daniels/\">Anthony Daniels</a>), who advises the player on how to take care of the Porgs. The player can feed the Porgs nutrients, point a laser for them to chase after, and even pick them up and throw them, though they will always float to the ground unharmed. The player can also plant blades of grass, which, if left undisturbed, will grow into patches of grass for the Porgs to play in. The Porgs' behavior changes over time as they become more accustomed to the player, even starting to playfully mimic some of their movements.</p>",
