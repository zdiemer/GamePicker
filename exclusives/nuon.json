        "description": "<p><em>Space Invaders XL</em> is one of several home console versions of the arcade game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/63254/space-invaders-dx/\">Space Invaders DX</a>. It's most similar to the second PlayStation version <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/63972/space-invaders-2000/\">Space Invaders 2000</a> and like that game it includes four variants of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a>, a two player versus mode and the time attack mode but lacks the parody mode. What's different in this version is that the time attack mode has new graphics and that the main mode adds gameplay features from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8806/space-invaders/\">Atari 2600 version</a> of the original Space Invaders: zig-zag bullets, fast bombs, invisible invaders and moving bunkers.</p>",
