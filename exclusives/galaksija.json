To make this more complicated, there are various bugs crawling in the mine which can nibble at your pipe and thus make endeavor or getting those diamonds more difficult. At more difficult levels the bugs will move as fast as the player while at the beginning of the game they move at half the speed.</p>",

The player's racket is on the right side of the screen and ball is hit toward the left side of the screen.

Each hit of the ball adds a point, and putting a ball through a crack in the wall earns even more points. There are three different game speeds which can be selected at the beginning of the game. Moreover, there is a counter that counts down whenever the player hits the ball and goes up when ball passes the wall. If the counter reaches zero, the game speed increases and counter resets.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Svemirski Trgovac</em>, which means \"space merchant\", is a simplified version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Elite\">Elite</a> for Galaxy computers. The game starts by placing the player immediately in pilot seat of a small spaceship. There are several different ship's controls. Distance meter shows distance to the base where you can land and trade. By approaching the base the player needs to slowly decrease the speed so the distance and speed are both zero, otherwise the ship will simply fly over the base instead of land. Energy meter measures energy consumption. There are various things on the ship that require more or less energy, such as scanner, laser guns (consume more energy when firing), force field, and ship's propulsion. Energy can be acquired by trading or by plundering pirate ships. Ship has 8 different speeds where 0 means the ship is stationary. Scanner can be turned on or off, but when turned on it will constantly scan for threats ahead though also slowly deplete ship's energy reserves. Course board shows the direction of the base and vector of player's ship's movement. Vectors are marked with numbers (i.e. 1 is up, 2 is up and right, 3 is right, 4 is down and right, and so on). The player can land on a base only from course vector indicated by odd number so ship's trajectory needs to be constantly adjusted. Force field can only withstand single shot on each side. It gets renewed by turning it off and back on. Laser gun is the ship's only weapon. When landed, computer will display what is being sold in the base, what merchandise the player possesses, what are the prices and player's bank account. The goal of the game is to amass 150 diamonds which is the debt the player has to pay off back on his home planet. The game also includes sound effects which are emitted through output for cassette player.</p>",
