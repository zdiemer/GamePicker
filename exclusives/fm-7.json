        "description": "<p>This game is based on the adult animation video of the same name. It mostly follows the main plot: The peaceful planet \"Rall\" is about to be overrun by the army of King Ram\u014d r\u016b. In order to obtain the sword of Reverse that has been handed down in the royal family of Rall for generations, Ramo has kidnapped Princess Yuria.  He is trying to find out where her sword is. It is said that those who wield the sword of Reverse have the power to rule the entire universe. At that time, Caron, who has obtained the sword of Reverse in the temple of Gomoros and became a swordsman, heads to Ramo's palace to rescue Princess Yuria, who is being held captive by Ramo. The object of the game is to give Caron precise instructions to complete the purpose.</p>\n<p><em>Cream Lemon: SF Ch\u014djigen Densetsu Rall</em> is an adult Japanese-style adventure. In this game, instead of playing as the main character, Caron, you are asking Caron what you want her to do. The interaction with the game world is performed by choosing verb commands from the menu (\"Investigate\", \"Take\", etc) that is displayed under a picture that represents the location. To navigate your way through the locations in the game you use the command \"Moving\" and the number of the location.</p>\n<p>However, you must always proceed with the game while caring about Caron's mood. If you enter strange commands Caron can quickly lose her temper, and when the mood meter reaches zero, the game is over. Caron's mood can be checked by using movement commands. You can check the current mood by instructing her to move in a direction that cannot be reached in the temple. You'll also communicate with characters like Peruru, K\u012bra and Raike from the adult animation video of the same name. They will help you to proceed in the game.</p>",
