        "description": "<p><em>Zaptrak</em> is a variant of a snake game. The player controls a man who leaves a trail of wall behind him as he runs around the screen. Running into the trail or any wall has to be avoided since it costs a life. The aim of the game is to increase the man's energy level which is done by running over electrical discharges (displayed as yellow squares). The player has an energy level of 100 when starting out and it decreases quickly when standing still but is stable when moving around. Running over the discharges increases the energy and upon reaching a level of 500 a door opens at the top of the screen which the player has reach to end the level. In addition to the discharges there are also pink obstacles that should be avoided since they force the player to stand still for a short while and therefore decreases some of the energy.</p>\n<p>There are four different stages in the game. The first one lacks obstacles more than the outer walls and has the yellow and pink squares appearing at random. The second stage features a spider that move in lines from the top to the bottom and leaves squares in its path. The spider has to be avoided since it will kill the player upon contact. The second stage also adds obstacles around the screen that also has to be avoided. The third stage is like the first but with obstacles added and yellow squares appearing less frequently. The final stage is like the second with a spider moving around and laying squares but here it moves in multiple directions and is therefore harder to avoid.</p>",
