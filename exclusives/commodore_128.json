The new version made use of the larger RAM capacity by tripling the range of levels in the game.</p>\n<p>Whereas the first Kikstart only has 8 levels to choose from, Kikstart 128 has three sets of 8 levels. You can choose to play three levels in one go, or select the \"grand slam\" mode to challenge an entire set of eight at once.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is the same, in that you have to ride your off-road motorbike across a range of obstacles without falling off, which will cost you time. The game is a split-screen affair for one or two players. The construction kit function of the later Kikstart 2 is missing from this C128-only affair, despite the games sharing the same name on the title screen.</p>",

You must drive your car back to your base in time while avoiding collisions with dangerous objects.</p>\n<p>The C128 version, making use of its larger memory size and more capacious floppy disk, contains more levels with a slightly more open layout and more advanced mission objectives. The first mission, for instance, revolves around picking up fuel canisters inside a secret base, instead of the original version's plain objectives of survival and punctualness.</p>\n<p>The steering method of Last V8 is not the usual <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Super+Sprint\">Sprint</a> one where you pull left or right to steer left or right; instead you simply pull the joystick in whichever direction you want to go, pulling it in the opposite direction in case you need to decelerate.</p>",
