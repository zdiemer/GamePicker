        "description": "<p>The Game.Com version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/365/duke-nukem-3d/\">Duke Nukem 3D</a> plays more like a dungeon crawler rather than an FPS due to Game.Com's hardware limitations. The player can only move Duke forward, backwards, strafe left or right, one screen at a time. By pressing B or C the player can turn Duke to shoot left or right, but can't turn him to face that direction and move.</p>\n<p>The game is divided in three episodes (L.A. Meltdown, Lunar Apocalypse and Shrapnel City) comprised of a total of twelve missions loosely based on the original ones of the same name, which can be accessed via passwords (given after the player dies). There are four weapons available (boot, pistol, shotgun and RPG) and four different kinds of enemies: Assault Troops, Pig Cops, Enforcers and Octobrains. Items like armor and key cards can be collected, as well as med kits and ammunition. There are four difficulty levels and the game also features Duke's digitized one-liners and other speech.</p>",

Leon can only be moved over three horizontal planes as in a 2D game with a side view, but with a pseudo 3D effect. Each non-scrolling location holds different zombies and once they are dead Leon moves to a new screen. He has access to an inventory to cycle between weapons. There is support for options such as touchscreen inventory menus, in addition to the game keeping track of the time the player has spent with the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based on Tiger's hit electronic toy, <em>Lights Out</em> is an expanded edition of the original brain-teaser. Players face a 6x6 grid (as opposed to the original's 5x5 grid) with a select number of lights lit and their goal, as in the original game, is to turn all the lights out (hopefully in the fewest possible moves). The player does this by using the stylus to touch the desired light, which will toggle it and adjacent lights on/off. Each puzzle has a certain minimum amount of steps for the player to perform in order to turn all the lights out (beginning at three and increasing by one every six puzzles). After that amount has been exceeded, the player has 10 steps to complete the puzzle or he/she will fail the puzzle and be forced to try again.</p>\n<p>In addition to original Lights Out, two other modes of play are available - Lit Only, which only allows the use of lights that are lit, and Toggle, where the player must press a light that is lit, then a light that is not, and so on, until the puzzle is either solved or failed. There's also a Random option for all three modes, where players encounter one of up to 60 billion puzzles to solve.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Batman &amp; Robin</em> is based on the 1997 film of the same name, in which the two titular heroes team up to stop the evil Mr. Freeze from turning Gotham into a city of ice.</p>\n<p>The game is primarily a side-scrolling brawler. For the brawling levels, players can select to play as Batman or Robin and choose two out of a list of five items to take with them: batarangs/throwing birds and gas grenades (each with limited ammunition), a grappling hook, and, for special obstacles, an ice blast cape and ice blades. The goal in each of the side-scrolling levels is to move towards the level exit while beating up hordes of enemies with punches, kicks or the throwable weapons. Level two ends with a boss fight against the movie villains Bane and Poison Ivy.</p>\n<p>In level three the game switches to a first-person shooting gallery. Players must take out enemies with batarangs or, if they get close, kicks, by moving a crosshair. Level four is again seen from the side, but has the selected hero scaling a wall on the way to Mr. Freeze's lair, avoiding rocks thrown by bad guys to make it to the final boss fight against Freeze.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Wheel of Fortune 2</em> is the second adaptation of the popular TV game show on the Game.Com. It is very similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/79631/wheel-of-fortune/\">previous game</a>, with some minor graphical differences and a new set of puzzles.</p>\n<p>As before, up to three players can play. There is an all-new selection of portraits for players to choose from. Game graphics and touch controls are unchanged: the game screen displays the word puzzle at the top, the current player and their score in the center and the input panel (with the possible actions and a virtual keyboard for letter input) at the bottom. When the wheel is spinning, it and a close-up of the wheel values are superimposed over the game screen. The game follows the rules of the TV show, with three regular rounds and a final bonus round for the contestant who won the most money.</p>\n<p>The game includes a new set of 750 word puzzles, some of which are in new categories like Fictional Character or Title &amp; Author.</p>",

Up to four players can play taking turns.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is unchanged from the original. The player controls a figure at the bottom of the screen that has to shoot at insects, including spiders, fleas and scorpions, and most importantly, a centipede that moves horizontally and moves closer towards the bottom of the screen when hitting an obstacle. When hit by a shot, the centipede splits into two separate sections.</p>\n<p>Game options include selectable difficulty, number of lives and movement speed. The start level can also be chosen. There is also an option to flip the screen so the game can be played with d-pad and buttons reversed from the standard.</p>",

Options include the toggling of the tournament timer and penalty timer and sort order of tiles on the rack.</p>\n<p>During a game, the board is seen from the top with player scores at the right and the tile rack at the bottom. The game starts with the full board in view, but two zoom settings are available to check out the details and to place tiles via touch interface. When playing against human opponents, it is possible to challenge their constructed words. This is not possible against CPU opponents, who check their words against a built-in dictionary.</p>",
