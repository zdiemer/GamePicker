        "description": "<p><em>Space Mouse</em> is a vertically-scrolling maze game. The player controls a cat who is travelling up through an infinite maze. The player gains points as they travel, and the goal is to travel as far as possible. Space mice travel down throughout the level, blocking the player's progress; the player must dodge the mice, and loses a life if they come in contact them. The mice have simple movement patterns but move quickly, and there are often several on-screen at a time.</p>\n<p><em>Space Mouse</em> was released as a type-in BASIC game in a 1981 magazine, and was later included in other type-in software books. A port was bundled with a number of enhanced remakes as a part of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/114050/space-mouse-35th-anniversary-edition/\">Space Mouse 35th Anniversary Edition</a> for Windows in 2016.</p>",

Birds will make an attempt in trying to steal the gyoza from you but can be hit which results in 100 points being awarded to you and if any of them fall it will destroy a piece of the ground limiting your movement and if one of them hits you then it's game over.</p>",

You have been ordered to deliver samples to Herius. You set off on a long journey in a state-of-the-art spaceship, with the military fund money of 100000 sollers, which can be used at the Station to refill the Ship Energy or be used to upgrade your Spaceship with the necessary equipment. You also need to make your way through the many obstacles that the game shows you, so choose your course pressing 1, 2, or 3 to pick a path which includes eight different games. At some point a Black Hole can be encountered which will require you to use full energy to get out, if that happens or if you get hit by to many enemies then your energy is red, and an Emergency Warp is initiated to get you to the Station. After making it to Herius the game has ended when curing the star from its destruction.</p>",
