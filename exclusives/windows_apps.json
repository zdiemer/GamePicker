        "description": "<p><em>Microsoft Jigsaw</em> is free-to-play collection of jigsaw puzzles. The jigsaws are sorted into themed collections and when starting out the player has access to two of these but there are more available for download. Most of these need to be paid for but there are also some that are free. Each collection consists of a certain number of puzzles with three available from the start while the rest has to be unlocked by completing previous ones. For each completed puzzle the player earns gold which is the in-game currency and can be used to acquire new collections. New collections can also be bought with real money. The amount of gold earned depends on the difficulty level (number of pieces). The easiest one has just 24 pieces while the hardest one has 216 pieces.</p>\n<p>In addition to the classic jigsaw puzzles there are two additional game modes: jigsaw jam and daily challenges. Jigsaw jam is a timed mode where the player is given one piece at a time and has to quickly find its place. Daily challenges appear every day and by completing these the player earns coins. The aim is to get badges by earning certain amounts of coins within a month. There are three different types of challenges: jigsaw jam as described above, lock breaker where the the player has to link a certain number of pieces in a certain number of moves to a locked piece and bug catcher where the player has to place the pieces so that a bug is surrounded on all sides. The game also allows the player to create his own custom puzzles by importing images. These can then be exported and shared with other people.</p>\n<p>The game features Xbox support that allows the player to earn achievements, compete with friends, submit scores to the leaderboards and track various statistics.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Monsters Love Candy</em> is a match-three puzzle game based around locating and removing matches from a board. The game is played on a board filled with pieces of candy of different colours. To score points the player has to draw a pattern of three identical pieces or more, either horizontal, vertical or diagonal. A match is not limited to a single direction, but can be long-winded in different directions across the entire board as long as the identical pieces are always connected in one of the three directions. There is no time limit, but longer combinations yield more points than smaller ones in succession. The pieces of candy that disappear in a match are replaced by new ones that appear from the top. There is an additional real-time mechanic to build combos. Whenever a match is created, there is a small time window to quickly draw a new pattern. If this is done quickly enough, multiple matches can be created in a single go that all disappear at once, for even more points. When the player is too slow, the drawn matches are executed and removed.</p>\n<p>In the game the player is a research assistant of a professor. The goal is to document and adopt different monsters in different environments with 35 monsters in each world and categories such as common, rare, legendary or mythical. In a level the monster is shown on the left side of the board. Each match fills a meter on the left side and when a certain amount has been reached, the monster is fed enough candy and the level is won. By creating a match of at least twenty pieces (in one go or through consecutive matches executed quickly in succession), a super candy is created for a large meter boost. When enough candy is collected the monster also evolves to a new form. When the level is completed the monster is stored in a scrapbook and it can optionally be adopted. Next to the basic currency of coins, the premium currency of purple gems is required to have additional storage slots. Experience is gained to level up.</p>\n<p>Next to a different look each monster has a specific set of boosters. These can appear next to the pieces of candy on the board. When a booster is included in a match with any type, a specific power-up is used. There are boosters that make all the remaining candy of that type float to the top of the board, double the multiplier or make the surrounding candy explode. Available boosters are shown on the right side of the board. By creating matches of pieces with the colour next to it, it is introduced to the board when the meter is full. Before starting a new level you choose a monster to have it level up just like the player character. Each new player level provides currency rewards and there are daily rewards as well. Additional currency can be bought as in-app purchases.</p>\n<p>By signing into the game with a Microsoft account it is possible to customize the monsters' looks, visit new worlds, earn achievements and access the leaderboards, and challenge other players. There is a waiting time / stamina system to the game when visiting multiple locations in successions. Players either have to wait, spend purple gems or watch a video ad to access the next location. Up to three stars can be earned per level based on the total score.</p>",

As blocks are destroyed, Frogger evolves from an egg into a tadpole, then into two intermediate stages and finally into a frog, with its speed increasing at each stage.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Bejeweled Live</em> is the first version of the series for Windows Apps. It is based on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Bejeweled+3\">Bejeweled 3</a>, but the game modes included are not identical to the Windows Phone versions <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Bejeweled+Live\">Bejeweled Live</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Bejeweled+Live%2B\">Bejeweled Live+</a>.</p>\n<p>The player is presented with a board filled with gems of different colours. The aim of the game is to remove gems from the board by swapping adjacent gems so that a chain of three or more gems is created. New gems will then be generated at the top of the screen and fall down in the empty spaces. This can lead to a chain reaction when gems fall down and create new matches. It is possible to continue swapping gems during a chain reaction. There are some special gems. Flame gems are created from a match of four gems and explode when matched, thereby removing surrounding gems. A match of five gems will create a hypercube which can be matched with any adjacent gem and then destroy all gems of that colour. Star gems are created by T- or L-shaped matches and destroy all gems that are right, left, up and down of the it.</p>\n<p>This version of the game includes three game modes: Classic, Diamond Mine and Butterflies. Classic is a series of levels presented as an endless mode. There is no timer or special objectives. Players make matches until no more moves are possible. Diamond Mine is played against the clock and matches need to be made to destroy dirt at the bottom. All dirt needs to be removed before time runs out. By digging through the dirt gold and treasures can be unearthed for extra points. Butterflies introduces a spider near the top of the screen that eats butterflies. The goal of this mode is to keep butterfly gems away from the spider by creating matches.</p>",

Next to weapons, vehicles and game this includes prefabs, pre-assembled collections of blocks that can be saved and shared.</p>\n<p>While multiplayer matches are possible it did not include any matchmaking functionalities when it was launched.

        "description": "<p><em>Forza Motorsport 6: Apex</em> is the first game in the racing series to be made available for the PC platform. It is released as for free based on the Xbox One title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/75709/forza-motorsport-6/\">Forza Motorsport 6</a>. Many features and elements are carried over, but in a lighter or scaled-down version. A full career mode is included. By completing events RP (Racing Points) is provided as a currency and up to three medals can be earned based on the performance. New cars are also unlocked gradually. Microtransactions are used to unlock cars early, but this is not required. The car and track roster is based on <em>Forza Motorsport 6</em> with 63 cars available at launch. It also carries over the Forzavista feature where all cars are fully functioning with working cockpits, doors, lights, sounds. The initial track list consists of six locations (Brands Hatch, Spa, Rio, Sebring, Top Gear, Yas Marina) with 20 configurations in total.</p>\n<p>Next to Free Play there is a Showcase Tour with twelve events where players are introduced to different types of cars and races with narrated videos. In the Spotlight Series different types of events are introduced and updated or changed regularly with new challenges. Elements that are not carried over from <em>Forza Motorsport 6</em> are multiplayer (both online and split-screen), car upgrades, mod cards, avatar design customization, the livery editor, UGC import, storefront, selling cars, the auction house, rivals, clubs, Playground, Rally, P2P. The Photo mode is available and there is a Practice option instead of Qualifying.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Shuttles</em> is a strategy game, requiring the player to get all five pegs on the opposite side before the opposing player does. On each turn, a player slides one of the seven shuttle pieces and repositions a peg to an adjacent hole (horizontally or vertically), until it reaches the opposite side. Due to the maze-like barriers on the shuttle pieces, it can be tricky to navigate pegs, especially if the player decides to slide a shuttle to block the path of a peg.</p>",
