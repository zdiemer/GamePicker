Criminal organizations have banded together - all under the leadership of Hector Vasquez, the mastermind behind it all.</p>\n<p>It is up to Joe Baxter and Michael Dvorak, tough cops from New York and Chicago respectively, to eliminate all the goons and henchmen of the mobs until they can go after Vasquez himself - with whom the two have a personal beef they'd love to settle.</p>\n<p>The game itself is a side-scrolling shoot-'em-up that can be played with one or two players simultaneously, and is very similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=narc\">Narc</a>. In five major US cities, all the enemies must be taken out using different weapons like flame throwers, tazers, uzis, rocket launchers, and grenades.</p>",

Upon arrival, Hunter soon realizes that all is not well on the space station Zekford.</p>\n<p>Zekford has been overrun with hostile aliens--the bodies of the research scientists lying strewn about the halls. Timothy must blast his way through the hordes of enemies and solve the puzzles contained in the data left in the station's central computer system in order stop the second alien from hatching and to save his friend.</p>\n<p>The game plays mostly as a top-down arcade shooter. The player must stay alive and interface with the various computer terminals throughout the level. These terminals provide the player with clues that allow the player to access new sections of the level. The clues come in the form of riddles that reference both the objects in the game and the back story contained in the game's manual.</p>",

The Medallion, a soul stealing artifact, was created by the young prodigy magician named Mendalick. The medallion made Mendalick age. Being too feeble to use it himself, he hid it in a rock of the Tower of Myraglen. </p>\n<p>After some time a king had an adventurer enter the tower to retrieve the medallion for him under the guise of it being for everyone's safety. The king then killed the adventurer and established himself as a despot of the land in the tower.</p>\n<p>Throughout the game the player has to find clues, fight monsters, and make decisions of both moral and strategic nature.</p>",

The player moves a crosshair with the mouse and has to shoot the villains as they peek out from behind cover. If he takes too long the enemies will instead shoot him, leading to a loss of health. At the same time the player has to watch out for civilians. If these are shot, some health will be lost, too. To regain health the player has to shoot the medicine bags that appear on the screen for brief moments. Keeping track of ammo is also important as once it's been used it takes some time to reload.</p>\n<p>For each outlaw killed the player earns 15 gold and at the end of the game the player might reach a high score. The game can be played by one or two players. In two player mode players take turns playing each level.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Talking U.S.A. Map</em> is an educational game that teaches geography. When starting out the player is presented with a map of the United States that is divided into four regions with different colours. Clicking on a region brings up a close up of it where any of the states can be clicked on. Doing so brings up a topographic map of the state along with three different buttons. Clicking on these will show various trivia and factual information about the state.</p>\n<p>The program also contains a quiz where the player is asked questions about the state capitals. The states will appear one at a time and the capital has to be typed in. The player has two tries and the quiz goes on until all capitals have been asked for. The score given is a percentage of questions answered correctly.</p>\n<p>Although the game is described as talking, only the names of the states are actually spoken.</p>",

The player's task is simply to click on a state and drag it to the right place on the map. There are three difficulty levels that alter the gameplay. On the easy and medium levels the states' outlines are shown on the map which they are not on the hard one. Medium and hard difficulties also have some states that needs to be rotated to fit. When a state has successfully been put in place, its name and capital will be displayed on the easy level while on the medium level the names has to be entered by the player and on the hard level both has to be entered.</p>\n<p>Map Quiz asks questions to the player and the player has to click on the correct state on the map. Different categories can be chosen depending on difficulty levels, including capitals, cities, landmarks, features and history.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ancient Glory</em> is a side scrolling action game based on Greek mythology. It is based on the adventures of Hercules who the player controls as he travels the Greek countryside (as well as some other locations in the Mediterranean) in his quest to defeat the gorgon Medusa. To do so five magical items have to be collected which is done by completing tasks for Hermes and Athena. At the same time Hercules has to be aware of the wrath of Hera, who will try to stop him. Time is limited as the player only has seventeen days of in-game time to complete the quest.</p>\n<p>The game starts out in Thebes with an unarmed Hercules who has to use his feet to kick at the scorpions that attack him. Weapons can be collected such as a club, a sword and a bow (which is given to Hercules by Athena when visiting Athens) which are needed to defeat animals such as lions, bulls and snakes as well as mythological creatures such as molionids and minotaurs. Levels are linear and involve moving from left to right but can be played in any order although locations that are farther away take a longer time to travel to.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Hover Blade</em> is an action game that uses a chase view similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1813/buck-rogers-planet-of-zoom/\">Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1434/space-harrier/\">Space Harrier</a>. The game involves steering a hovercraft with the mouse as it automatically moves forward and the objective is to reach the end without crashing. The path ahead is full of various obstacles such as trees, bushes and structures which has to be avoided since collisions leads to a loss of power. When all out of power the craft will be destroyed. The craft also has a limited amount of fuel and it's necessary to collect fuel canisters to refill. Missiles can be used to destroy obstacles but come in limited supply. To recharge the missiles the craft has to fly through a black sphere. The player will also come across gates that when flown through gives bonus points once a level has been completed.</p>",

The first click is for choosing the direction to aim in and a circular swing meter will then appear. An indicator on the meter shows the direction and a second indicator will start moving backwards. The second click decides the power of the swing with maximum force being applied when the indicator goes all the way back. The third click sets the spin of the ball which then will be released.</p>",

The player enters a strange place called Mazeworld and is immediately greeted by an invisible character called George who is being attacked by a very large cat. George acts as a guide in the world but the exact purpose or goal of the game is never made fully clear and it's up to the player to explore the world. Various strange creatures inhabit the world some are hostile and have to be killed while others are friendly and can be talked to.</p>\n<p>The game entirely uses the mouse to move around and interact with the world. Interaction is done by firing energy pulses which there are four types of: creative, destructive, affirmative and negative. Creative energy is used for expressing friendly intentions while destructive energy is used for killing enemies. Affirmative energy is used to say yes while negative energy is used for saying no. All uses of the different energy types are not explain and it's up to the player to figure out.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Milestones 2000</em> is an adaptation of the card game Mille Bornes. It is a remake of the author's Apple II game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/82928/milestones/\">Milestones</a> and like that version it is for one player competing against an AI opponent. It has all new graphics and an interface that uses the mouse to drag cards onto side view images of the cars. Most of the rules stay the same but with some modifications. Each race is 1500 kilometres which can be extended to 2000. By extending the race the player can earn additional bonus points. The game ends when one player goes above a total of 5000 points.</p>\n<p>The player has access to seven cards and can for each turn either play or discard one card. There are four types of cards: distance, problem, fix and power cards. Distance cards are used to drive the amount of miles listed on them but require that a go card is played first. Problem cards are used to prevent the movement of the opponent who has to play a corresponding fix card followed by a go card before being able to play a distance card again. For example, the repair card fixes the accident card and the spare tire fixes the flat tire. Power cards when played make the player immune to the corresponding problem cards.</p>",

Some of these power-ups contain maps which fill in the screen in the bottom left, allowing the player to advance to the next level when completely filled. The goal is to return to Earth, and there are 10 levels in total. The player starts with 5 lives, and it's game over when all are lost.</li>\n<li>Naxos: Played from a first person perspective, the player must shoot alien creatures as they appear on the screen. If the aliens are allowed to shoot, the player takes damage. The player has limited ammo, and must continually reload. The player has a health bar, and when all health is depleted, it's game over.</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Secrets of Bharas</em> is a fantasy themed RPG for Apple IIgs.</p>\n<p>The six great lands of Bharas lay in isolation from each other for many years until adventurous human sailors from Surya learned to traverse the ocean waves and established communications with the other lands, including the lands of the Dwarves and Elves. It is the discovery of magic in two separate lands that leads to a great conflict between the races. Eventually over 200 years, 3 more great conflicts ensue, until finally peace is restored between the lands. Now after 2 years of peace, the player's band of adventurers learn that King Narayan's latest peace envoy has gone missing. The players must discover and stop whomever is trying to lead the lands into conflict once again.</p>\n<p>Game play is from a top-down perspective, where the player can move about the surface of the planet, as well as enter towns and talk to the various inhabitants via text entry. The player can shop at various stores. Combat occurs on a 9 x 9 combat field based upon player terrain. The player can move all 6 of their characters independently, or can have the computer automate combat. Players can level up, and purchase improved armor and weapons. The player has mages and healers who can cast powerful magic spells. Dungeons are explored from a 1st person perspective.</p>",

The player has limited fuel for each level, and if this runs out, a life is lost. Each level has a final boss battle, and a supply depot, which the player can dock with to load a new weapon or purchase other supplies. The ship is also armed with a limited shield supply, which can be used to temporarily make the vessel invulnerable to alien attack.</p>",
