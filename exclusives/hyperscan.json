        "description": "<p><em>X-Men</em> is a fighting game that was bundled with the HyperScan console. Like with all HyperScan games it comes with a set of six cards that are required to play the game with more cards being available separately in booster packs. There are different kinds of cards: character cards that unlock new playable characters, MOD cards that improve a character's attack or defense skills, finishing move cards that can be used to finish off an opponent in a dramatic way, counter action mod cards that give immunities to a character, danger room cards that can be used to train a character and ultimate character cards which feature higher attributes that ordinary character cards. </p>\n<p>Upon starting a game, the player has to scan the character card he wants to use followed with any MOD cards he has access to. A one on one fight between two characters will then follow and when it has ended the player can upgrade his character by rescanning his character card. The gameplay is similar to other fighters with the player being able to kick, punch, jump and duck. There is also a mutant attack which requires a meter to charge before use. The game features a one player tournament against a series of enemies and single matches for two players. There is also a quickfight mode as well as the danger room which is used for training.</p>",

In each mission the player must traverse Ben through the level and defeat a boss in a limited amount of time. At certain points of the level, the player will need to scan a card to change Ben's current form, allowing him to interact with objects that he normal can't in human form. At any time, the player can upgrade Ben's power with the correct power up cards.</p>",
