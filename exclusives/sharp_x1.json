        "description": "<p><em>Kagirinaki Tatakai</em> is a vertically structured platform shooter. The player controls a character whose goal is to descend as deep as possible into a complex underground system. The protagonist is equipped with a jetpack (which allows him to hover in the air for a while), a laser gun with unlimited ammunition, as well as limited supplies of rockets and grenades. Rockets can be shot straight ahead, while grenades can be thrown down in curved trajectories. Various types of enemies, both stationary and moving, will try to stop the hero by shooting at him. The player character takes no damage from either physical contact with an enemy or falling.</p>\n<p>The game's stand-out feature are destructible environments. Rockets and grenades can be used to destroy any part of the scenery, be it floors, platforms, or walls. The player character, however, cannot leave the screen horizontally; walking through a hole in the wall on either side makes him appear on the opposite one. Destroying solid structures can be used to bypass maze passages or gain a better angle for shooting.</p>",

However, it is ultimately up to a group of unknown adventurers to find it and perhaps put an end to the struggle.</p>\n<p><em>Issural: The Story of Calvan</em> is a medieval-themed fantasy role-playing game. Basic gameplay mechanics follow the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=dragon+warrior\">Dragon Quest</a> template, with overhead exploration, random enemy encounters, and turn-based combat. The game resembles the first <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=final+fantasy\">Final Fantasy</a> in requiring the player to create a party of four characters out of several available races and classes. Points can be distributed to increase the characters' attributes initially. Battles take place on separate top-down screens and feature the possibility to position characters before engaging in combat. There is a day and night cycle in the game.</p>",

Gameplay-wise, it's mostly identical to the first game - you must walk 600 meters to reach the enemy castle and kill the Dragonet. The player controls three units: the King, Knight, and Pawn. When moving these units, you can either move your entire army at the same time, or move all of one type of unit. Only your own units can initiate battles. All units gain strength while fighting and after fighting a sufficient number of battles, Pawns and Knights will be promoted to stronger, golden forms of themselves. There are captive Pawns along the way that can be rescued to increase your ranks, but only Knights can break the gates in front of them. There's also barriers every 100 meters, which can only be broken by King Suren. The King is also the only one who can destroy large trees in some of the forest areas.</p>",

Made up of three miniature games, the X1 version purports to train your abilities of reaction, memorisation and spatial thinking.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Limit 0.x s</strong> is a reaction game where you are presented with sixteen panels where a heart symbol appears at random intervals, upon which you must press a key before it disappears. Sometimes, a human figure appears instead, whereupon you mustn't press that key. Score is awarded according to how fast you press the key, with bonus scores if you mark rows or columns of panels.</li>\n<li><strong>Box 26</strong> is a memory game where you must find the letters of the alphabet between 26 boxes in the correct order by moving a little human figure around the screen. The time limit is 300 seconds.</li>\n<li><strong>Block 888</strong> presents a cube made up of 8 x 8 x 8 transparent blocks (512 in total), viewed from three axes. Some blocks are blue, and you must count those blocks.</li>\n</ul>",

The Cessna is severely damaged and difficult to repair. You do find a car, but the key is missing. The objective of the game is to escape from the town. Several items can be found around the town that can be collected and need to be used in order to proceed.</p>\n<p>There are basic room descriptions and the text commands are in very simple English. This has to be done in full sentences. (Example: 'OPEN CABINET') Movements can be done by typing F(ORWARD), B(ACK), L(EFT), R(IGHT), UP and DOWN. Once the car key has been found, you can start driving the car by pressing 8 (UP), 2 (DOWN), 4 (LEFT) and 6 (RIGHT). To be able to start the car, press 5, but if you want to stop the car, you have to press 1. By pressing 3 you can get out of the car when you arrive at one of the buildings.</p>\n<p>In the adventure screen your current strength and thirst are displayed on the left of the screen. When driving the car, the screen is always in top view, showing the various stats such as gasoline, physical strength and thirst on the lower part of the screen. They will decrease over time, so gasoline, food and water must be sought to replenish them. If they run out, the game is over.</p>",

Senbei-san</em> is an action running game where you play as Senbei Norimaki who runs with a kite in his hand who's on his way to meet up with his fianc\u00e9 Midori Yamabuki at the end of the goal before the time runs out while avoiding Aho! Bird, Poop Boy (who comes out of the Aho! Bird), air vent and electric pole that will shock Senbei. He can recover some time by shooting a white bird with his laser gun and can jump over air vents that will let him take out the laser gun by pressing space or using left or right trigger on the joystick in order to shoot at the Aho! Bird and White Bird which turns them into PON. You speed up or slow down Senbei by pressing 4 and 6 to move while strolling through nine rounds and then the game loops. If you get hit by Poop Boy, trip over air vent, get electrocuted by electric pole, or the kite gets hit then the timer will go down fast and if it runs out then \"Empty Full\" which means that Senbei has ran out of time and breath. If all of his lives are gone then it is game over.</p>",

There are pictures dropped in the passageway and the objective is to pick them up and collect them in a specified order. He has to combine all of the 4 picture pieces in stage 1 then in stage 2 collect 8 picture pieces, and 16 picture pieces of the ice cream in stage 3. Twenty points will be added to Mimitan for each picture he picks up, and 30 points will be added when he arrives at the \u2661 place. Mimitan also has to avoid Fox-san because if he runs into him, he'll be captured and if the fox catches him 4 times, it's game over. He can pick up an apple for 50 points, cherry for 100 points, and carrot for 200 points and swift footed. There is also a bonus stage which is like Amida lottery. Here, based on your decision, you will be able to save one of the rabbits that are stuck in a cage but if you accidentally reach Fox-san another one will be added in the next stage as an enemy or if getting to nothing results in no consequences.</p>",

You must get into the castle, retrieve the stolen scrolls (5 scrolls in total), and come back. When the Aokage appears, your shuriken will not hit it because it's invulnerable, and the blue shadow will thrust its spear at you. In each room, there is a candle in the center, which must be lit to see the opponent. There is a pit or a suspended ceiling somewhere in each room, and if you go near it, you will hear a sound, so avoid it and go through. When you have the scroll, return to the initial position. When you step on the corpse of the Shirokage, you fall down and die. If you are in the wrong position to kill the Shirokage, you will not be able to go to the upper floors. If you jump on the suspended ceiling, you will fall and die. As you progress to the next floor the difficulty increases.

The gate that is blocking the entrance needs to be destroyed by the cars that move faster than her. She can change their course by placing stop signs that will help navigate them and after doing so she can now transform into the 16-year-old Magical Angel Creamy Mami. When she starts her transformation, the fans will follow her, but she can't do it in front of the fans because if that happens, she'll lose a wand and fly away as an angel forcing her to try again. The number of fans along with the transformation is decided by a counter that tallies the points up to 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, and 640 when they enter at the same time. On top of that if Yuu runs out of time along with getting hit by the cars, then she'll also lose one a wand. At the end of the stage a password is given so she can select a stage after getting a game over.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mr. Pac!</em> is an action game in which you take control of the main character, Mr. Pac! holding a fork-shaped farm tool. The object of the game is to collect all the items on the screen without getting hit by Pocky or Nanjamonja. The task must be done within a certain time limit. If all the items have been taken, then Mr. Pac! will go on to the next round. In the later rounds, some of the items are protected by closed doors. In order to open the doors, Mr. Pac! needs to step on the colored markers that are in each corner of the maze. Each colored marker corresponds with a door, so stepping on a blue marker will open blue doors which were shut. Stepping on it again will close blue doors. The enemies can be defeated by guiding Pocky to Nanjamonja so that they cross paths with each other four times in each round. Each time Pocky and Nanjamonja cross paths, Nanjamonja changes color. Nanjamonja changes from blue to pink to green to red. At the end a bonus item appears, such as a Power Drink Vase. Once Mr. Pac! grabs it, the music changes and he can touch his enemies for bonus points. This will only last for a limited amount of time. From round five onwards, enemies can also be crushed by falling bells, which are released when Mr. Pac! walks over them or boxes with a question mark on it. They emit up and down vibrations that can be used to defeat enemies.</p>\n<p>Other bonus items can be a hammer or light blue tube that automatically will open doors that are still closed, a key that closes all doors that were open, candy (1000 points added), a slice of cake (3000 points added), a clock that completely replenishes time, a diamond (adds one more Mr. Pac!), a grasshopper that automatically grabs all the items and so on. Waiting too long the bonus item will turn into another Pocky. Sometimes a crystal is peeking out from the underground. If Mr. Pac! picks it up, he gets 10,000 bonus points.</p>\n<p>If time is up or Mr. Pac! gets hit by Pocky or Nanjamonja then one of the lives will be lost.</p>",
