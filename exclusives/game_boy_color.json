With new worlds, aliens, and more familiar candy, Commander Keen journeys again to the far reaches of outer space, this time to save the sacred Crystals, stolen by the evil Droidicus. You play the role of Billy Blaze, who, when he isn't tinkering in his secret workshop building new inventions, dons his brother's football helmet and transforms into Commander Keen, Defender of the Earth, when the universe is in trouble.</p>",

During both games, you can pick up \"Charabombs\", creatures that you can raise as your own, and fight against other players Charabombs. It's a simple bonus game of Rock/Paper/Scissors, but the only way to complete the entire adventure is by linking both games together via link cable and pass over levels from one cart to the other, as each game has unique levels, so as to collect all of the Charabombs.</p>\n<p>In Max: Blue you play as Bomberman himself, with all of the classic graphics and sounds that have been part of the series from the start.</p>",

When you change a character, the character you take out rests, and the power level increases. Also, some areas can only be completed by using the certain powers of each character. </p>\n<p>Apart from the normal mode of play, you can also play a second version, where you must fight all of the Boss characters, and if your character runs out of power, you cannot use him/her again.</p>",

When this so-called destabilizer ray is completed, Lady Deathstrike and her fellow mutants Cyber and Sabretooth fully intend to use it, depriving the X-Men of their most powerful fighter. Wolverine has no choice but do whatever it takes to stop her from achieving this goal.</p>\n<p>Wolverine goes alone in this action platform title, where the player takes control of the most famous of the X-Men, who hacks and slashes his way through twenty levels of enemies and bosses. There are four main activities which Wolvie can perform: hack and slash with his claws (the main attack); jump (very important to get through levels); heal (if he stays still, he will heal a little at a time; however, each level has a limited amount of time to complete, so standing around too much can be lethal); and enter the rage mode. If the player presses the attack button several times in a row, Wolvie will go off in a rage. Although hard to control in this state, his attack range improves. He also loses a little health every time.</p>",

All characters have their own signature moves, but as you move on through the quest more special powers are unlocked  - these include speed, invincibility, and strength. </p>\n<p>Shrek: Fairy Tale Freakdown appears to be aimed towards young children, due to the character theme and the lack of blood.

One S.T.A.R.S. member, Leon S Kennedy (from Resident Evil 2) was sent out to destroy the weapon, but the team have been unable to contact him since he arrived at the ship.</p>\n<p>Using a combination of top down side-scrolling action and 1st person shooter, it is your job to get aboard the liner, currently floating in the Atlantic Ocean, destroy the weapon and find Leon. Along the way, you'll come across plenty of deadly  undead enemies, similar to those found in the original Resident Evil series, while using a range of weapons and items found in the ship.</p>",

Abe's vocabulary is limited to \"Hello\", \"Follow me\" \"Wait\" and \"Work\". He must use these commands to direct slave Mudokons to their freedom. When enough slaves in a level have been saved, you go on to the next level to do it all again.</p>\n<p>The game uses a password to save your game. </p>\n<p>The game features both an easy option as well as the normal mode.

While doing so, Fred/Barney have to fend of a multitude of pests and avoid being attacked by enemies.</p>\n<p>Certain extras (Buffalo Hat, Club, Elvis Guitar etc.) grant time limited special powers such as speed, invincibility or the help of Dino, the Flintstones pet dinosaur.</p>\n<p>The game has 25 Levels, some scrolling horizontally.

Playing either Tom or Jerry, who have slightly different attributes (speed, power, size), the player has to fullfil a bunch of tasks centered around dozens of little nephew mice, invited by Jerry for his birthday and scared of into hiding by Tom. While Tom is looking to beef up his next meal, Jerry is trying to rescue his nephews. Depending on the level, the player has to collect a varying amount of mice during a varying timeframe. Various extras such as bombs, clubs, pans, cheese, a rubber duck and so on help with the task. The player has to run around an 8 way scrolling level and return the mice to his nest/hole (where they could still be bombed, counting for the opponent). Extras can be used to distract, punch, flatten or otherwise execute the opponent, essentially delaying him.</p>\n<p>Progress is tracked via a password</p>\n<p>The game also offers two mini games, 'Whack-a-cat' and a game resembling an old LCD game.</p>",

They can be defeated with different types of balls that Buster has at his disposal (football, soccer and baseball), that vary in their behaviour. The Baseball travels at slow speeds horizontally and explodes if it hits walls. It stuns all enemies close to the explosion. The Soccer Balls bounces of the floor and is bound by gravity, meaning that it will drop of edges etc. The Football travels very quickly and diagonally bounces of everything for a set amount of time.

Typical Mission goals would be centered around clearing the screen of all elements, but hitting certain targets on the way and making sure that there is still a route to the exit. If the player reaches the exit with all mission objectives complete, the next level is introduced by a password. Playtime per level is up to 20 minutes and there are 150 levels. The first 20 or so levels introduce all game elements one by one.</p>\n<p>There are various extras, allowing to manipulate puzzle pieces, remove blocked routes and so on, as well as special blocks such as teleporters (beaming you around the playfield), or ice (making direction changes impossible) etc.</p>\n<p>The basic principle is like memory, i.e. two equal looking puzzle pieces need to be found and are then taken of the playfield. To do that the player can 'clone' the blob, and send his alter ego to connect the blocks occupied by the main character and the clone.</p>",

A level based game. Every level consists of a labyrinth of colored pathways, scattered valuables, locked doors, keys, a thief (the player), on some levels an opposing thief and a door marked exit. The goal is to reach the exit to proceed to the next level, valuables can be 'stolen' for score. If the opposing (computer controlled) thief reaches the exit before the player, the game is lost. Movement is not possible between differently colored tiles, unless a special, multicolor 'bridge' stone is used. 99 levels total.</p>\n<p><strong>Spring weekend</strong>. A rotation puzzle, where a given pattern needs to be recreated by rotating elements on the playfield.</p>\n<p><strong>Lineup</strong>. Using 'Tetris' style blocks, a continuous line from a screen border to an opposite screen border needs to be build. Elements appear on an element stack, and can be selected freely from that and subsequently placed anywhere on screen, without overlapping each other. If the element stack is full, the game is over. As soon as a line is complete, the elements of that line are removed from the screen. Elements appear faster over time.</p>\n<p><strong>Finty Flush</strong>. A grid on top of the screen fills slowly with multicolor balls. The player can pick one out of 4 squares on the bottom of the screen to shift balls in one line into and out of these squares. The squares can be rotated in 90 degree steps. As soon as any square is completely full with balls of the same color, its content empties to make room for more balls. 3 filled square grids grant a bonus point, and the next level begins (tiles appear faster). The game is over when the upper grid is full.</p>\n<p><strong>Color Collision</strong>. A 'Qix' style ray ( no better way to describe this - for the younger audience - imagine a flapping fan ) moves with increasing speed through a screen full of obstacles. The player can only indirectly control it - any time the direction pad is pressed, it gets 'reflected' into the direction that has been indicated. Objective is to hit obstacles with a given color and pattern, avoiding all other elements. To top things of, the patterns change over time.\nThe game ends if the wrong obstacles have been hit too many times.</p>\n<p><strong>Rat Poker</strong>. Little differently colored rats are automatically fed into labyrinths, with labyrinth design changing and getting more complex during level progression. Switches allow rerouting of the rats to arrange certain color combinations ('hands') of rats. If a given combination is achieved, the contributing rats exit the playfield through a door. You progress to the next level if a given number of rats has been removed from the game. The game ends if there is no space left on the playfield for additional rats.</p>",

The game is played through an isometric perspective on the arena similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=NBA+Live+96\">NBA Live '96</a> for the SNES. </p>\n<p>The game is jammed with all the goods you expect in a basketball game including real teams, players, and lots of stats. You can play an exhibition, full season, or playoffs with your favorite team, and you will be able to customize the rules of the game right down to the amount of time per game played. Although you only have 6 players on the court at any time, all of the usual plays and move are available, and you can sub at any time. There is also a create-a-player mode for you to put your name in the game, and you can trade for any player you like.</p>\n<p>2 player support is also included.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Dark Duel Stories</em>, the player's goal is to defeat various characters from the <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> manga, anime, and card game, eventually making it to the four Rulers of Ancient Egypt, who have the precious Millennium pieces. Each character must be defeated at least five times in order to get to the next stage. Typically, the goal of a card duel is to reduce the opponent's 8000 life points to zero; however, sometimes a duel can be won by forcing the opponent to run out of cards in their deck, or by having all five pieces of Exodia in one hand.</p>\n<p>As usually in <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> games, cards represent monsters: as a general rule, a monster with a higher attack and defense rating emerges victorious. However, in this game elemental affinities play a role as well. For example, a monster of the Aqua element will be beaten by a monster of the Thunder element even if his attack and defense ratings are somewhat higher. </p>\n<p>The player can also create his/her own cards by combining card halves that can be obtained after winning a duel. A trade mode and a real-life battle mode (using the link cable) is also available.</p>",

The games have been tweaked to make it slightly easier and allow the player to progress faster: quick-save (the quick-saved game deleted after it is loaded) is enabled anywhere except in battle, banks in which some gold can be stored in case the player dies have been added, and monsters now reward with more experience and gold.</p>",

You perform tricks to achieve a high score. Race mode is viewed from a top-down perspective, where you goal is to perform tricks and get to the end quickly.</p>",

Players can control either side, each of them offers 30 missions. </p>\n<p>Warlocked brings real-time strategy gaming to the Boy Color set in a fantasy warfare scenario. The key to victory is a balanced mix of resource gathering, building, exploration and combat. Adding a magical twist to the straightforward action is the presence of wizards, each of whom has one powerful spell. While some wizards can convert enemy troops to your side, others can change them into chickens or skeletons. More than 20 kinds of wizards are hidden throughout the game.</p>\n<p>Using a Game Link Cable, you can test your war skills against another player. Two-player battle maps are earned by progressing through the single-player game. Warlocked also enables you to build your own personal armies with resources that you have saved in your campaigns in single player mode, and then trade them with a friend using the infrared ports on the console.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The first handheld <em>Sakura Taisen</em> game, released between the second and the third main ones, takes place in the original setting: the imperial capital in Japan of 1920s. It is the Taishou era, time of rapid technological development and acquaintance with Western lifestyle in Japan. Disguised as a group of actresses in the imperial theater, the Hanagumi Brigade consists of lovely ladies who are at the same time skilled fighters, able to pilot mechs, and to confront the forces of evil that threaten Japan. A new commander of Hanagumi arrives at the theater to work under the guidance of Ichiro Ogami, the main hero of the series. He leads the beautiful girls Sakura, Sumire, Honglan, and others into battle against demons.</p>\n<p>As in most other games in the series, <em>Sakura Taisen GB</em> is a mixture of Japanese-style adventure with dating mechanics and tactical turn-based battles. The light RPG angle is also present, as the girls fight differently depending on how the protagonist treats them. Unlike other Sakura Taisen games, the battles here are entirely menu-driven. Also, the main plot is non-linear, and it is possible to reach fourteen different endings, which also include bad ones. The hero may even get thrown out of the theater for indecent behavior.</p>",

Bibi Blocksberg now has find all the parts to put them together and to restore the witches' mental health.</p>\n<p>The game is an action-adventure. The seven levels, each corresponding to one witch and one part of the crystal ball, are full of monsters which hurt Bibi when she touches them. The health can be restored by finding sweets hidden in the level. Apart of monsters, there are persons which help her. In each level there is a magical item, often reachable only after getting through a little \"game in game\", that expands Bibi's magical powers, for example the broom that allows her to fly. The magic has to be used sparsely, because it costs magical energy, which can be recharged by finding little pulsating dots. This magical item is needed to get to the witch of the level, which Bibi has to fight. If she wins, the witch gets back to normal, gives her a part of the crystal ball and Bibi can go the the next level.</p>\n<p>There also is a password system that allows the player to jump to different situations in the game, so that one does not have to play it through in one session.</p>",

The other one was a manager game, <em>O'Leary Manager 2000</em>.</p>\n<p>The gameplay in O'Leary Manager 2000 is not only about the management aspects of football. It's a bit similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/2945/sensible-world-of-soccer/\">Sensible World of Soccer</a>, as you can play not only as the manager but also the player. This rendered using an top-down view similar to many Amiga games from the early nineties.</p>\n<p>In total there is 240 licensed teams from the top two divisions in six European countries. As the manager you get to lay up training schedules, buy and sell players, pick the right players for the right tactics, and a lot of statistics. The game handles matches in three different ways, playing them, watching them or a text-based interface similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Championship+Manager\">Championship Manager</a>, but with highlights shown in the top-down view. If you don't want to play through the whole season, you can play single matches against the AI or another player. The manager mode also supports multiple players.</p>",

You receive a call from Dispatch, telling you to arrest suspects that have just committed a felony. There are ten stages in the game, and each one of them has you placing three agents throughout the city. Each one of these agents have their own specialties. Once you have placed the agents, you must guide one of them toward the suspect vehicle. If the vehicle goes outside the city, the game is over.</p>\n<p>Once the two of you make contact, the battle begins where the object is to ram the suspect's vehicle until it is disabled. You can also shoot the vehicle to further damage it, and use up to three turbos to catch up with the vehicle if you happen to fall behind.</p>",

Once you obtained all the items within the building, you will have to go through the building in the opposite direction twice before facing all your opponents in one room. Once you have done this, you move on to the next one, that has tougher enemies than the last one. You will always start at each building with the same weapon.</p>",

You start the game with a Lotus Elise, but as you gain more money you'll be able to buy other cars like Mustangs and Jaguars. </p>\n<p>The game offers three modes. The first one, <em>Single Race</em>, involves beating the clock and other computer opponents on any of the tracks using any of the cars. In the tournament mode, you can earn extra money to buy new and better cars, or to upgrade your current car. You can also unlock additional tracks. In the <em>Cop Chase</em> mode, you take control of a police car and have to pursue the computer controlled racers. The game also has a two player mode allowing you to compete using the Link Cable.</p>",

This deity, Quaxet, was imprisoned by the combined efforts of the Mayan, Aztec and Inca cultures, and now some nasty treasure seekers are looking to spoil it all by unleashing the evil. Having knowledge of this, Lara must set out to prevent the disaster from happening by finding the stone first.</p>\n<p>This version has the standard Tomb Raider gameplay of running, jumping and switch-flipping, but presented in a side-view 2D style, reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Flashback\">Flashback</a>. At Lara's disposal are 25 or so moves, which are crammed onto the 2 GBC buttons. There are also game-save crystals at special points throughout the levels.</p>",

For example, the whole concept of Star Points, which was such an important part of the console game has been removed. Left is a football game with a quite ordinary style. Due to the Premier League license all twenty teams are real and have real world players (16 in each team). The gameplay resembles the style of many classic games in the genre and is viewed from an top down perspective. Play modes available are friendly match, full season or a custom league of the players' choice.</p>",

As the night wore on they fell asleep and fell prey to the spirits living in Bart's tree house. Now each member of the family must fight through his or her nightmares to return to reality.</p>\n<p>The game re-creates tales from the annual Treehouse of Horror Simpsons episodes. Each member of the Simpson family has his or her own levels, including Marge in a zombie tale, Maggie as a fly, Lisa fighting cannibalistic teachers, Bart rescuing his dog in a haunted house, and Homer as a vampire killer, a robot, and Homer Kong.</p>",

With no family or friends, he must fend for himself on this strange, seemingly uninhabited island and ultimately find a way to return home.</p>\n<p><em>Survival Kids</em> is presented in an overhead action-RPG style similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Link's+Awakening\">Link's Awakening</a>. Players must try to survive through each day by getting enough rest, eating food and drinking water regularly. This can be risky, as certain foods such as mushrooms can have varying effects including paralysis and poison, while other foods can go rotten and make you sick if you eat them.</p>\n<p>The game also features a unique \"merge\" system, which allows you to create a number of different items by combining two other items. For example, combining bark and a stick would produce kindling, while using ivy with a bent stick could create a bow. There are plenty of useless items that can be made in addition to the essentials, so it's up to the player to think as to what could be helpful in their quest to survive.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Metal Gear Solid</em> (original Japanese name: <em>Metal Gear: Ghost Babel</em>) for GameBoy Color is not the same game as the popular Playstation/PC installment of the series. It is not set within the storyline of Metal Gear series, but instead tells an unrelated episode featuring the same hero - special agent Solid Snake. A secret government project, codenamed \"Babel\", attempts to revive the Metal Gear project - development of a highly destructive mech weapon. But an organization known as Gindran Liberation Front hijacked the Metal Gear prototype, without which any further development would be useless. Solid Snake is sent to infiltrate Outer Heaven, a location not entirely unfamiliar to him, and to retrieve the prototype.</p>\n<p>The game is similar in style and gameplay to early Metal Gear games. It is viewed from top-down perspective, and its gameplay is mostly based on stealth. Snake has to sneak past the guards, using various tactics to distract them or to kill them silently. Weapons, gadgets, and moves are all similar to those used in the other Metal Gear Solid game. From time to time Snake will also encounter bosses whom he will have to defeat in order to proceed to the next area. Virtual Missions for Snake are also included in this release.</p>",

In addition, card combinations of Famous Witches and Wizards Collector's Cards can be used to produce powerful magical effects. These cards can be found all over the freely explorable Hogwarts. Potions that refill stamina and magic points can be found, bought or mixed by Harry himself, but only with the right ingredients.</p>\n<p>As in other Potter games, Harry also competes for house points for Gryffindor, hoping to win the House Cup in the end.</p>\n<p>The game features several mini-games that, once found in the main game, can also be accessed from the main menu.</p>",

Professor Ludwig Von Drake had just finished all the carnival floats and was showing them to Mickey, Minnie, and all their friends. However, spying from his creepy mansion on the outskirts of town was Big Bad Pete, furious at the group enjoying themselves. Soon, he'd gathered his cronies and raced into town, swiping all the floats and decorations. All that was left was a letter challenging them to a race to get their things back.</p>\n<p><em>Mickey's Racing Adventure</em> centers around isometric racing challenges in various worlds. It's possible to play as Mickey and his friends, as they explore various parts of Mickey's town, earning money for car upgrades and finding train tokens to travel to different worlds and challenge Pete and his henchmen to various races. For a fee, Magica de Spell will also conjure up spells for you to use in races and get an edge on your opponents.</p>\n<p>The first time you travel to a new world via the train, Casey Jr., you must play a special train mini-game. Pete has muddled the tracks leading to the worlds, and you must guide Casey Jr. by shifting the track tiles around so that he doesn't hit any dead-ends. There are also TNT detonators that you must set off by running into them before you can guide Casey Jr. to the exit.</p>\n<p>The game also allows you to play as Pluto - while he can't race himself, he can sniff around town and dig for secrets. He'll also find hidden tunnels which let you play a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Digger\">Digger</a>-like mini-game where you must either collect all the bones underground, or defeat the other dogs in the area by dropping rocks on them. After completing the objective, Pluto must then head to the exit.</p>\n<p>Mickey's Racing Adventure also supports the Game Boy Color's Infra-Red feature by allowing you to send e-mail to your friends via the Infrared Communications port. Once you unlock the Print Shop, you can also use the Game Boy Printer to print out assorted Disney stickers.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Weasels have kidnapped Mickey Mouse's dog! All that was left was a ransom note with a picture of Pluto being hauled away in a van, and some scrawled writing taunting Mickey to try and catch them. Not knowing what else to do, Mickey called up his friends, who all volunteered to help - even Big Bad Pete plans to race! You'll have to speed across the country to catch up with the weasels and rescue Pluto!</p>\n<p>Mickey's Speedway USA is an isometric racing game that uses the same engine as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Mickeys+Racing+Adventure\">Mickey's Racing Adventure</a>. Players can choose from Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, Goofy or Pete (and some secret characters too) as they race around various famous cities and landmarks from the United States, including Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon, San Francisco, Montana, and Yellowstone, just to name a few.</p>\n<p>The Adventure Mode of the game plays out Grand Prix style. You must complete four races in each world, and at the end of each race, you're given points based on your placing. The player with the most points at the end of the four races wins the trophy for that circuit. There are assorted power-ups that help you as you race, including the Baseball Chucker (a projectile), the Magno Flyer (a homing missile), the Carbo Spritzer (a turbo), and the Paint Splotcher (an oil slick).</p>\n<p>There is also a Time Trial mode which lets you race any track that you've previously unlocked - while you can use it to practice tracks, the goal is to race fast enough to beat the track's lap time and earn a gold star in every race. Another mode is Professor Von Drake's 'Driving School'. In this mode, you must complete specific tasks given to you, such as parking, reverse parking and slalom driving. The faster you perform these tasks, the better ranking you will receive (again, with a gold star as your ultimate goal). However, you will receive a time penalty if you hit a cone or wall, or miss your parking spot, so accuracy counts as well.</p>\n<p>Mickey's Speedway USA supports many of the Game Boy Color's functions - you can play a two-player link cable race, transfer data from Mickey's Racing Adventure via the IR Link to unlock a secret, and connect to the Nintendo 64 version of Mickey's Speedway USA using the Transfer Pak. As you progress through the game, you'll unlock many postcards and pictures for your album, which can be printed out via the Game Boy Printer.</p>",

The plot involves Communists attempting to rebuild an ancient time machine, whose pieces are spread across 19 levels. </p>\n<p>There are largely-switch-based puzzles to solve on each one, and different routes through to completing them.

In each level, you play the part of either Bibi or Tina. Be careful, there are enemies which you should not touch \u2013 this costs life energy, which can be restored by gathering horseshoes. The task is to find some clue where Felix has gone, as well as finding three sacks of horse food so that you can ride on to the next location. There are several little mini-games you have to master to get some item or clue.</p>\n<p>To get to there, there is a side-scrolling arcade sequence where Bibi and Tina are racing each other and where you have to jump obstacles.</p>",

Mostly, you'll be punching and kicking, but there are some guns with rather limited ammunition to find along the way.  There is also one stage where Spawn rids a motorcycle, somewhat along the lines of the surfing and skating levels in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.</p>\n<p>There are three difficulty modes.  In each mode, enemies can take more damage.  One punch will knock out any minor enemy in easy and you can start at any stage.  It takes two in normal and you must play through from stage one.  On hard, it takes several, so the fighting becomes much more strategic.  You must beat the game on hard mode to get the real ending.</p>",

In this game, he is not alone, as a party system was added: his friends Ron and Hermione (and some other characters) will join Harry in the battles. While Harry (as in the previous game) can use card combinations of Famous Witches and Wizards cards to produce special attacks and effects, his friends have other means: Ron can unleash his rat Scabbers in special rat attacks and Hermione, being the know-it-all that she is, influences combat through \"lecture attacks\", using helpful hints like \"Be Careful!\" (which increases defense, for example).</p>\n<p>Gone is the potion-mixing from the first game, but aside from the party system, several other features were added: the Informous spell divulges information about strengths and weaknesses of enemies, which is stored and can be accessed later. To aid in finding one's way around Hogwarts, floor maps were added.</p>\n<p>Like the first game, this one also includes several mini-games, including Quidditch, that once found in the game can be accessed from the main menu.</p>",

She and her friend Bianca are dreaming of going on a riding holiday in Arizona. To get the money required for it, they have to win horse tournaments.</p>\n<p>There are seven levels. They are divided into two types: There are action-adventure levels where you have to accomplish different tasks -- like helping your parents or shoeing your horse. To do this, you have to speak to different people, find and use items at the right location and succeed in some mini-games, all the while keeping a safe distance from evil animals (like sheep...) which hurt you when touched.</p>\n<p>Between these action-adventure levels, there are the tournament levels in which you perform in several different riding disciplines, often with some qualification stage before.</p>\n<p>At the end of the game, there is another arcade sequence in which you have to drive the taxi to the airport. If you have done this, you can enjoy the ending. After finishing the game, you can switch to a \"tournament mode\" where you can replay each tournament to get as much points as you can.</p>",

Upon opening it, magical stones are released from their prison, and head to a castle which is suspended in the sky. The power of the stones upsets gravity, and the castle comes crashing to the ground, right on top of Wendy's house! It's up to Wendy to set things right again!</p>\n<p><em>Wendy: Every Witch Way</em> is a combination of a side-scrolling platformer and a puzzle game. As Wendy, players explore the castle in search of the troublesome stones that have upset gravity. Wendy has the ability to control gravity herself \u2013 by pressing up or down on the control pad while jumping, Wendy will cause gravity to reverse in that direction. Most enemies and obstacles in the game world are also affected by the gravity switching \u2013 you'll need to manipulate gravity frequently to progress through the game's different puzzles.</p>\n<p>Stars can be used to power up Wendy's magic. For every star that she collects (to a maximum of five), her magic will increase. Beginning with a small weak shot, you can power your magic up to a spread shot that fires in three directions. The stars also act as Wendy's health meter \u2013 if you get hit, you'll lose a star, as well as some magical power. Get hit when you have no stars left, and you'll lose a life.</p>\n<p>At the end of every world, there is a short bonus stage with Wendy riding on her broomstick. In these stages, you must attack enemies and collect stars as Wendy automatically flies to the next world.</p>",

There are also a few new moves added such as alley-oops. The number of players in the game has increased to 140 and there are now more secret courts. The gameplay is still very similar to last year's game but the added extras are welcome and makes the game a little more enjoyable to play.</p>",

To spice things up, the game has been given several game modes, and, most notably, a licence to several popular manga characters created by Osamu Tezuka. Play as famous characters such as Astro Boy, Kimba or Black Jack.</p>\n<p>Apart from the main Columns mode, this edition features a puzzle mode like that of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/25556/nazo-puyo/\">Nazo Puyo</a> games, where you must remove a set of pre-installed pieces using a set of pre-defined dropping pieces. There is also a link-up mode for battling with friends.</p>\n<p>The Tezuka characters play no big role in the game, being displayed in a window to the right of the playfield, changing mimics according to how the game progresses. You have six characters to choose from, and three save slots to put them in. The save slots let you keep your score for upcoming sessions.</p>",

You'll get to meet Goemon and co. in the flesh and as luck would have it, a unique threat looms over both eras and only you can save the day.</p>\n<p>The game plays as a traditional Japanese RPG in which you control a party of up to 3 characters from Goemon's gang and explore the game world getting quests and advancing the main plot. Combat switches you to a turn-based side-view in which your selected \"lead\" character performs the main attacks and actions while your other characters lend their special abilities in supporting roles.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Another RPG title for the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Ganbare+Goemon\">Ganbare Goemon</a> series. Once again you take control of the wily adventurer Goemon and his buddies as they travel through feudal Japan fighting evil in its wackiest incarnations. This time around an evil warlord seems to have taken control of Edo castle and used the place to flood all of Japan with strange demons. </p>\n<p>The gameplay is similar to the other RPGs in the series, in which you control your party from an overhead map and explore each area getting quests and items in order to advance the main plot. While you control a party, combat is strictly one-on-one, as the game attempts to join the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pok%C3%A9mon\">Pok\u00e9mon</a> craze with \"dueling\" combat between individual monsters. Additionally, you can capture and train the monsters you defeat, and even upgrade them or merge them with other creatures to obtain additional powers. The game can also connect with the similarly-themed <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Mononoke+Sugoroku\">Mononoke Sugoroku</a> for the N64, in order to transfer and exchange monsters between both titles.</p>",

Forgoing RPG touches, the game returns to the action / platformer roots of the 16-bit titles by casting you as Goemon and his pal Ebisumaru as they traverse several levels based on a bizarre version of feudal Japan in hopes of defeating the forces of an evil alien invader.</p>\n<p>The Game alternates between stages featuring either Goemon or Ebisumaru. Each character takes a different route towards the bad guy and as a result the stages scroll differently for each character. You can collect upgraded items and weapons but there's no character upgrading besides that. The game also features mid-level bonus rounds featuring the rest of Goemon's buddies in several arcade mini-games as traditional for the series.</p>",

Whenever you defeat a monster, you gain their unique card which can be tapped to summon said monster to join you in your quest. You can have up to two monsters fighting by your side at any time, and they level up and gain experience just like you do.</p>",

As mentioned you win matches via points awarded whenever you connect a direct hit or perform a successful move. </p>\n<p>This version of the game adds a health bar that influences performance and a round-based system. Furthermore all graphics have been redrawn and the character selection has been expanded and now includes 12 playable characters, each from a different location.</p>",

Kage Mishima, the archenemy of the clan, has stolen the magical sword Daikatana, which allows the one who wields it to bend the fabric of time and change reality. In addition, Mishima's minions kidnap Hiro's friend Mikiko. He must rescue her, travel to different time periods, and put an end to Mishima's ambition.</p>\n<p>This version of <em>Daikatana</em> is quite different from its <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1678/john-romeros-daikatana/\">PC and console</a> counterpart, being a top-down action game with puzzle-solving, somewhat similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Zelda\">Zelda</a> games, though with less character customization and more focus on dungeon-crawling. Two companions eventually join Hiro; some of the puzzles can only be solved with their aid. The dungeons, which represent locations of different cultures and time periods, usually conclude with boss fights.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</em> is a 2D side-scrolling beat'em up (quite similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1299/bad-dudes/\">Bad Dudes</a> - only several levels have limited 2.5D gameplay). The game is very different from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/2204/turok-2-seeds-of-evil/\">Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</a> for PC and N64, which is a first-person shooter and has a different story. The player controls main hero Joshua Fireseed, who became Turok and fights against the Amaranthine Accordance, a legion of dinosoids. The gameplay is quite simple - the player goes left, jumps over holes and spikes, climbs up, and of course kills enemies, like humans, various dinosaurs, giant bees etc. The hero uses several weapons which must be found first. Certain levels have a different design compared to the rest of the game, such as riding on a dinosaur, for example.</p>",

All characters have different skills in abilities like spin or balance.</p>\n<p>The player uses items around the streets or the park to jump from or over to increase the score, and pull of as many wild and wacky tricks as possible. The main difference to the other versions of the game is the level design and perspective: The environments are side-scrolling and linear. However, there are several of those tracks side-by-side which can be switched at ramps. There are three playing modes: career (a campaign through all nine levels), single session (accumulating as many points as possible within a time limit) and free skating.</p>",

It only has nine fighters (Raiden, Liu Kang, Scorpion, Reiko, Tanya, Fujin, Sub-Zero, Quan Chi and the unlockable Reptile) and less special moves.

        "description": "<p>OCP Technologies has developed an organic and mechanical hybrid supercomputer which they've named \"The Mind\". Unknown to the scientists however, The Mind has secretly been infiltrating computer networks around the world. When the project is finally deemed complete, OCP puts The Mind in control of the security systems of Delta City. At the same time, a gang war erupts in the city and several laboratories are broken into and looted. The police recieve a lead on a gang leader named \"Nexx\" who may be involved and assign RoboCop, a cyborg law enforcement officer, to bring him in.</p>\n<p><em>RoboCop</em> is primarily a top-down action game. Robocop can move up, down, left and right across the map. Enemy units should be shot at to engage, while civilian units need to be protected. RoboCop's objective varies by level but typically involves destroying a particular enemy or finding \"evidence\" items scattered throughout the level. Each level is made up of several maps screens. Between missions RoboCop returns to the police station where he can consult with his ex-partner Lewis, review the station's news or talk to Dr. Lazerus, the scientist in charge of cybernetics.</p>",

The levels progress generally from left to right with some vertical movement. However, Croc also has to explore a bit on the side in order to find keys and bonus areas with rewards. Those are usually either extra lives, shortcuts or crystals which also serve as life energy: every time Croc is hit, one crystal is lost. Croc's main abilities consist of jumping, pouncing, and using his tail to get rid of enemies. In some levels, he also has to swim or ski.</p>\n<p>The game features about 30 levels divided into four areas (jungle, desert, ice world and the castle itself) as well as bonus rounds between levels like a sliding puzzle.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Asterix and Obelix (based on the French comic book series), must embark on a journey from the forests of France to the coliseums of Rome. Their goal is to find Obelix's lovable pet dog, Dogmatix. Players take control of Asterix or Obelix, and run, jump and punch through various well-drawn and colorful levels in this side-scrolling adventure game.</p>\n<p>This title is somewhat non-linear, and allows players to choose the order in which to visit stages, as well as the numerous mini-games. The stage-select screen is a mini-map, and after selecting to play either Asterix or Obelix, players can visit the boss arena, the inn (extra energy, hints and passwords are found here), as well as the the local mini-game. These mini-games become available from the title-screen under the \"Instant Fun\" option. They vary from a \"Memory\" style shield-matching game to humorous events such as \"Throw a Roman Mini Game\".</p>\n<p>Both Asterix and Obelix play differently as they have individual abilities and limitations. Asterix is more nimble, can run faster and jump higher, whereas Obelix is more powerful (being able to bash through some walls) but noticeably slower. These differences are highlighted by the obstacles presented in the stages - there are many jumps to make as well as many enemies (Roman soldiers, boars, centurions) to dispose of. In the quest to find Dogmatix, it is vital to collect keys hidden within the levels to make available new areas. Similarly, it is also important to collect coins from beaten enemies as they allow the purchases at each inn, (which is aptly manned by Getafix himself!).</p>",

Opera wakes up, gathers all crew-mates and decides to send S.O.S. to their friends on Earth. While the help is coming, the first events begin.</p>\n<p>The player must then assign three crewmates to the team in order to explore the planet. When on the ground, the player may switch between team members, walk around the planet, go inside locations, interact with items, talk with friendly persons, and begin battle with hostile creatures. Each member has a certain number of skills, which may be used and developed in traditional Japanese RPG style, and some unique abilities. The monsters are seen by the team and battles may be avoided.</p>\n<p>The battles take place on side-scrolling screens and are action-based, with the player directly controlling the main selected character in the team, while others act according to their own AI.</p>",

Unfortunately for both the aliens and Godzilla the military is out to destroy both, so Godzilla now has to fight off the military to throw back the alien menace.</p>\n<p>There are seven levels in all. The player will travel through each level destroying the military to reach the end of the level and fight the boss monster. The only control the player has over Godzilla is his attacks as Godzilla will walk on his own from left to right on the screen in a linear path. There are four attacks to choose from: Stomp, Bite, Tail-Whip and the famous Radiation Breath.</p>",

Each world is divided into several levels. The object of each level is to find all film clapboards present.</p>\n<p>Bugs and Lola can jump and hit things with a mallet (or rolling pin for Lola). They also both feature unique special abilities. Bugs Bunny can dig and move heavy chests and Lola can float down safely from large heights with her parasol. Players can switch between characters at any time.</p>\n<p>Power-ups in the game include carrots for energy required for special abilities, a super carrot that allows the player to fly like a helicopter (using his ears) and the habanero carrot, which makes the player invincible for a while.</p>\n<p>If you collect the letters EXTRA during the level you get to play a small minigame where you have to shoot firecrackers at moving targets.</p>\n<p>Each of the worlds ends with a showdown with the major character of that world. Usually this involves running from a vehicle that pursues the player, while avoiding obstacles.</p>",

The Game Boy Color iteration of this game looks nothing alike compared to its Windows, PlayStation, and Nintendo 64 counterparts, which share the same name. As in these games, the player finds one's self in EuroReptarLand, this time it is all in 2D.</p>\n<p>The player may move around the theme park using a top-down view. Around the park the player will find various points of interest, where the player may play one of the eight side-scrolling platform levels or seven mini-games. Advancing to the new platform levels requires the player to collect tickets, which are won through playing the mini-games. Mini-games include target shooting, fishing, shooting hoop, tossing frogs, and hammer shot. The events are displayed on a single screen.</p>\n<p>The platform levels have various themes such as clouds, rocket ship, a gooey world, a haunted mine, a volcano, a pyramid, a pagoda, and the Notre Dame. The goal of the game is to eventually find Chuckie a princess to become his new mother.</p>",

Other characters, such as Cutter or Azteca, are present in the game as well.</p>\n<p>The tournament begins with four \"sportz\" activities, and four additional events are available based on your performance. Heated competitions like the 100mm race, flea hurdles, and pebble toss are scheduled. Strength, endurance, and dexterity are not enough to win the Olympic title in these events. You will also have to apply your individual character's skills as well as those of your competitors. Athletic ability and calculated gaming tactics are needed to claim your title of Olympic champion of the Anthill.</p>\n<p>In 2D side-scrolling mode, you should press the buttons quickly to run or to throw an sports item. There are five stages in the game, and each following stage may be accessed only receiving the medal in previous stage. Current progress may be resumed with a password.</p>",

They love to dance, sing, and slowly learn human speech. Specifically a Furby is an autonomous toy robot manufactured by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tiger+Electronics\">Tiger Electronics</a>, licensor of this game. These toys were among the first successful domestic robots. Here they will be dancing for you. </p>\n<p><em>Dancing Furby</em> operates as a classic rhythm game, with a line of button prompts scrolling across the screen that you will have to press when they reach the current time mark, supposedly matched with the music. A Furby on screen will dance in accordance with your performance, commenting on your timing in Furbish, \"noo-loo\" being perfect, \"e-day\" being acceptable, and \"boo\" is shrilled for failure. At the end of each song you'll have you score calculated in \"noo-loo\"'s etc. and then be allowed to continue.</p>\n<p>Successfully clearing a stage will result in you being able to 'connect' the Game Boy's infrared port with the matching port on the forehead of a Furby toy. This will impart information about the song to your furby teaching it to warble F\u00fcr Elise when you least expect it.</p>\n<p>You may also select a Furby to dance with in the game, be it spotted, striped, or lozenge-faced. Good performance will unlock more Furbies.</p>\n<p>Songs in the game include Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, F\u00fcr Elise, and a few 'popular' numbers.</p>",

You can manually adjust many aspects of the car before each race, such as transmission, gear, and tyre types and the alignment of your spoilers.</p>\n<p>The game features five playing modes (Grand Prix, Exhibition, Challenge, Time Trial and Two Player), two difficulty settings and allows for three separate save games. You can turn damage and different weather types on and off.</p>",

Progression is not strictly linear: some of the levels can be freely explored in any order before continuing with the story. Locations include the city, subway and sewers, the docks and a warehouse. The levels are usually crawling with enemies that Spider-Man can beat up with kicks and punches. Defeating them will eventually result in him gaining levels, becoming stronger and learning some new fighting moves.</p>\n<p>Spidey's special abilities come into play when he swings freely over the rooftops, clings to walls or throws web balls at enemies to immobilize them.

        "description": "<p><em>Micro Maniacs</em> is a racing game in the Micro Machines series. This time however, you don't get to race cars, boats or any other type of vehicle, but micro men. Most courses are on foot, but others allow you to take small vehicles such as jet skis and skate boards.</p>\n<p>The game offers a variety of micro men to play with, ranging from mutants, cyborgs, mad professors, experiments gone wrong, and other strange characters. They all have their own special weapon to give them an edge in the races. The races are organised by a mad doctor who hopes to find the ultimate soldier among these micro maniacs.</p>\n<p>The Game Boy Color version is completely in 2D. In good Micro Machines tradition, the races are all held in and around the house, including the garage, living room, bathroom, study and deck.</p>",

This ticks Marvin off and he goes back to Earth again to take revenge on Daffy.</p>\n<p>Marvin can only walk and shoot, so he has to rely much more on the other characters to help him (for example to fit through small holes or jump over pits). This time there are 45 Looney Tunes characters to collect and play with. These can again be traded and won in two-player mode. The game is compatible with the previous game, so you can bring characters from the first into the second game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Disney's Beauty and the Beast: A Board Game Adventure</em> is a game for the Game Boy Color. There are two modes of play. In the first you play on a big game board, where each square represents a Disney character. When you land on a square you play a mini-game against or inspired by him or her. For instance if you land on the square showing the inventor father you will have to play a game where his new log chopping device cuts firewood and he has to bounce it across the screen on a spring. These mini-games range from 2D platform game segments to memory or reflex games. There are a total of seven boards to play on. You can play with up to four players.</p>\n<p>The second game mode is a 2D platform game where you have to beat bad guy Gaston to the castle to warn Beast from an upcoming mob. There are three levels to play through. You'll also have to play mini-games from time to time in this mode.</p>",

Donald Duck turns to Gyro Gearloose for help, who suggests using his latest invention: a powerful teleporter. Unfortunately, Merlock learns of their plans and steals the blueprints to the device. Now Gyro uses the unfinished machine to teleport Donald to various locations, where he is to find the parts of the blueprints, so he may confront Merlock and rescue Daisy.</p>\n<p>Donald has to face four different worlds, including the forests near Duckie Mountain, the rooftops of Duckburg, and a haunted house. His abilities include jumping on top of enemies to defeat or stun them and double-jumping in mid-air to get to hard-to-reach places. Donald can only take one hit from an enemy (which puts him in a visibly grumpy mood), a second one means losing a life and having to start over the level. Goodies to be collected include various orbs that gain extra lives, restore Donald's health or put him into Hyper mode. In this mode, he can simply run over enemies to defeat them and also break down barriers to get to new locations.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Spirou: The Robot Invasion</em> is a 2D side'scrolling platform game based on the Franco-Belgian comic <em>Spirou et Fantasio</em>.</p>\n<p>Fantasio bought a strange mechanical device. When he brings it home and thoroughly inspects it, it turns out to be a malevolent robot who subsequently escapes from the house. Soon a villain called Cyanide appears to be involved and the entire town is crawling with evil robots. It's up to the player (as Spirou) to set things straight! Armed with a maul you have to trash the robots. Controls are similar to other platform games: you can walk, jump, attack, use a switch and grab a ledge. You'll have to solve simples puzzles such as pressing switches to open doors. You can pick up items that restore your health or unlock bonus levels. The game also has a UBI key that allows you to unlock a secret level, and can also be used to unlock secrets in other Ubi Soft games.</p>\n<p>The game is presented in comic strip style much like in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3300/comix-zone/\">Comix Zone</a>, where you move from frame to frame, each divided by a white border.</p>",

You play as this former emperor and cynical llama in his search for a cure for his curse.</p>\n<p>Each level is a series of platforms and the llama can walk around, duck and jump to navigate. He can charge and perform head butts to attack opponents. He can also spit as a ranged attack but requires spit drops for that which he must collect. The player has a number of hit-points but can collect hearts to replenish them.</p>\n<p>Puzzles include locked doors, switches and barriers, which mostly have to be solved using your spit or charge action in the right places.</p>",

These goals include reaching a certain score through tricks and combos, performing special tricks, or collecting items. The eight levels (shown in isometric perspective) are filled with half- and quarter pipes, ramps, rails and many obstacles to perform tricks on. Two dozen different tricks are available through various button combinations, some of which must be unlocked first by finding tokens in the levels.</p>\n<p>In training mode, unlocked levels can be practiced without the time limit present in career mode.</p>\n<p>The game also offers a multiplayer mode, where up to four players can take turns on a single GBC and the player with the highest score or the best trick combo wins.</p>",

Unlike both the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/21495/f-1-world-grand-prix-ii/\">Nintendo 64</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/36849/f1-world-grand-prix-ii/\">Dreamcast</a> version the Game Boy Color version is completely in 2D, just like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/36355/f-1-world-grand-prix/\">its predecessor</a>. Playing modes include: exhibition, Grand Prix, time attack, challenge and match race. The latter is a two player mode which works with a link cable. Like the Nintendo 64 version the challenge mode allows you to replay some critical events in the season. Cars can be completely adjusted (tyres, gears, wings, fuel load) and comes with variable weather conditions. You can change said settings before a race and during pit stops.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Zebco Fishing!</em> is an officially licensed fishing game for the Game Boy Color. It features 11 different lures and 2 lakes to fish on. The player can participate in a tournament and Blackjack Bass. The tournament mode gives you a limited time to catch the biggest fish. In Blackjack Bass you have to catch 21 pounds worth of fish, similar to the game Black Jack. Each time you catch a fish, you get its weight and can decide to \"hit\" or \"hold\". If you exceed the 21 pounds you lose.</p>\n<p>The player can row his boat around the lake until he has found a suitable fishing location, where he can cast his line and wait for the fish to bite. Once a fish is nibbling the bait the player has to hook it and then reel it in. When you do so you must make sure your line doesn't break by keeping an eye on the tension. </p>\n<p>Weather conditions, time of day and location all have impact on the chance of catching a fish. Each type of lure also improves the odds in specific types of water and weather types. Somewhere in the two lakes also dwells the legendary Lochness Bass a giant fish which is yet to be caught.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Metal Walker</em> is a mechanical take on Pok\u00e9mon, where the story takes place in the future on an island where a mysterious element called core has been discovered. This \"core\" element was used to create a highly advanced race of robots called Metal Walkers that are used for both labor and protection for the people of the island. One day, however, a gang of robots decide to rebel and end up killing a very prominent member of the island. The player then takes control of the son, Tetsuo, with the help of Dr. Hawk and Tetsuo's Metal Walker in an attempt to hunt down the rebel robots and avenge his father's death.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is very similar to Pok\u00e9mon, where the player explores various areas of the island searching for clues called Data Packets and battling other Metal Walkers or wild Walkers called Metal Busters, but instead of capturing these walkers, the player instead destroys them. Destroying these other Walkers results both in scrap metal and items called Capsules that can be used to upgrade or \"evolve\" Tetsuo's Walker into a more advanced form. Additionally, the player can take the scrap metal to the Junk Shop where they can also be turned into capsules as well. Additionally, capsules can not only contain power-ups, but traps as well that can be used in battles.</p>\n<p>The battles are also different, whereas this one the attacks consists of rolling attacks that are angled off of the walls of arenas. Additionally, if a player fights multiple opponents, all of the enemies will be present on the screen at one time and if they choose the right attack and angle, can result in multiple hits on multiple opponents.</p>\n<p>There are also three types of Walkers: Land, Marine, and Sky where, just like in Pok\u00e9mon, susceptible to the other (ex. Land walkers have advantages over Marine walkers but are vulnerable and weaker to Sky Walker attacks). Base camps can also be built around various areas of the island and can be used for restoring the health of the players Walker.</p>\n<p>As the player progresses farther into the game, they will encounter over 100 different Walkers, each with their own strengths and weaknesses as well as bosses that have to be defeated in order to access more areas of the island. Players can also use the Link Cable to both battle their Metal Walkers or even exchange their base camps.</p>",

Once again the evil Dr. Claw has brought misery onto the world by unleashing a horrible new virus called the Madkactus virus and it is up to Inspector Gadget, his niece Penny and her dog Brain to stop Dr. Claw and save the world yet again.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is a side-scrolling action game as the player takes control of Inspector Gadget, Penny and Brain in five different levels, each with four different areas to explore.  The player will experience enemies and traps along the way and can use famous devices such as the hammer hat, spring arms and rocket shoes to either elude or eliminate enemies or avoid deadly traps.</p>\n<p>Along the way, however, Gadget will have to rely on Penny and Brain to reach areas that are inaccessible to him.  Both are weaker in attacking, but are faster and can be used to transverse past traps and deactivate them to let Gadget past or solve puzzles in mini-game form in order to advance to the next area.</p>\n<p>Additionally, players can find power-ups such as muffins which will restore health and GG symbols, obtaining 20 of these symbols will give an extra life.  Also MAD symbols will give Gadget three extra lives.  Gadget can also pick up weapon items such as plungers, which can pick off enemies from a long distance or nets which can instantly kill any enemies that it comes in contact with.</p>",

The player takes control of <em>Action Man</em> as they travel through seven different levels ranging for jungles to the Arctic, battling an army of robots with a variety of weapons and battle suits in search of Base X and stop Dr. X from launching a terrifying new weapon that could very well bring an end to the world.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is a standard side-scrolling action platformer where the player advances throughout the level, destroying enemies and avoiding pit falls. Along the way they can pick up more powerful guns as well as a bow and arrow and even different suits that can help them on their quest. Additionally, players can find these weapons and suits by taking different paths throughout the levels.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Despite its license, <em>WWF Betrayal</em> is not a wrestling game, but a brawler reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Double+Dragon\">Double Dragon</a>. The player starts off as either of the four WWF superstars: The Rock, Triple H, The Undertaker, or \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin. The story consists of the player's selected wrestler being just moments away from winning the WWF Championship before getting hit from behind by an unknown assailant and defeated. The protagonist wakes up to discover that Stephanie McMahon, a WWF manager and Triple H's wife (both on-screen and in real life), has been kidnapped, and her father, the federation CEO Vince McMahon, promises the player's character another shot at the title if he rescues Stephanie.</p>\n<p>There are six levels to choose from; the protagonist traverses these stages and fights off referees, street punks, security guards, and even other WWF superstars with punches, kicks, dropkicks, or with various weapons scattered throughout the stages, such as steel pipes, nightsticks, 2x4's, and others. Not only does the hero have to defeat enemies: he also has to avoid various traps and pitfalls - patches of fire, floor traps, and laser cannons, to name a few.</p>\n<p>There are also power-ups that are located in various places throughout the game, which can replenish the protagonist's health and power bar. Additionally, when the player fills up a character's power bar, he can unleash his unique finishing moves, such as the Stone Cold Stunner or the Pedigree, on a selected enemy. There is also an option for a second player to join in, using a link cable to team up and help out on the friend's journey.</p>",

The main bulk of the game is side-scroller with stages where the player moves from right to left trying to escape a wall of water while avoiding enemies and pitfalls and even a scene recreating the valley escape in the blimp, but with the same elements. There are also one-on-one sword fighting stages where the player uses a sword to hack away at enemies that appear one at a time and even a first-person shooting stage that resembles <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/15901/lethal-enforcers/\">Lethal Enforcers</a>.</p>\n<p>There are three different characters to choose from, Rick O'Connel, Evelyn O'Connel and Ardeth Bay that they can choose at the beginning of each stage, each with their own strengths and weaknesses and depending on which character they pick will determine which stage layout will be present (ex. Rick &amp; Evelyn's water escape stage feature different traps and enemies they must avoid).</p>\n<p>There are eleven stages total and a password feature that allows players to pick up and play at their leisure.</p>",

However, all of a sudden someone steals all of his four rocket engines and he is forced to make an emergency landing. After having woken up from the crash he realises that not only are his engines gone, but all of the monsters have escaped!</p>\n<p><em>Bomberman Quest</em> is a top down action RPG in which Bomberman has to traverse four different lands and speak to the natives to aid him in his quest to reclaim the engines and monsters. In true action RPG fashion, you pick up upgrades along the way, such as bomb parts and skills acquired from defeating monsters.</p>\n<p>There is also a battle mode where two players can duke it out via linked Game Boy Colors.</p>",

In each mission, your goal is to race to the end of the level before the bad guy does. If you do so successfully, you face off against the villain, and hopefully capture them. In addition to capturing the villain, there are secondary objectives like collecting robot parts and getting the fastest time through the level.</p>\n<p><em>Disney/Pixar's Buzz Lightyear of Star Command</em> is a spinoff of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Toy+Story+series\">Toy Story series</a> of movies.

They can walk, run, jump, climb, collect objects, and use cutlasses. In most levels you should proceed from one part of level to another collecting a certain number of items, sometimes significant ones such as parts of a map showing the way to El Dorado. Different opponents will try to prevent your progress, but they can be either avoided or eliminated.</p>\n<p>Different arcade sequences such as running away from a bull or riding a horse as well as several battles with bosses are present. Such encounters include fights with a cougar, Cortez himself, and also playing Indian basketball against the Indian champion.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Game Boy Color version of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=5037347130010\">Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six</a> game scales back the 3D visuals of the original game in favor of an almost top-down view, but builds on the same premise of the player controlling a member of the Rainbow counterterrorism unit, responsible for resolving hostage situations and neutralizing threats, in sixteen missions.</p>\n<p>The limitations of the platform are not traded in for an arcade-like approach. Just like the major computer version it stresses careful planning and tactics. After a briefing that needs to be followed attentively, the player assumes the role of the commander and assembles a squad of eight operatives, each with different statistics and abilities, based on character traits such as aggression and self-control, physical elements such as stamina, and specific skills including stealth, firearms, electronics, demolitions and many other types of weapons. They can be divided into up to four independent teams. Next, the operatives are outfitted with a selection of six different rifles, six different handguns, 24 types of armor or camouflage and additional tools including heartbeat sensors and door charges. Default equipment is suggested right away, but that is not sufficient for later missions. In the planning mode, the last part of the pre-mission activities, the commander needs to set out waypoints on the map and determine the course of action.</p>\n<p>The actual missions are shown in 2D where the different characters can sneak around, blow up doors, rescue hostages and engage the enemy, all requiring a tactical approach. The general plot points and mission objectives are true to the computer version.</p>",

It's a kart racing game but on the handheld it is viewed from a top down perspective. Some of the most famous Nickelodeon characters are competing on the race track and the player can choose to play as any of them. </p>\n<p>Two game modes exist: quick race and championship. In the quick race mode players can choose to play any track of the four available program environments. In the championship the player has to complete each track in a specific order. </p>\n<p>The game allows the player to race as the following seven Nickelodeon characters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tommy</li>\n<li>Eliza</li>\n<li>CatDog</li>\n<li>Arnold</li>\n<li>SpongeBob SquarePants</li>\n<li>Dagget</li>\n<li>Norbert</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tracks are divided into four different program environments: Angry Beavers, The Wild Thornberrys, SpongeBob SquarePants and Rugrats. There's numerous power ups that the player can pick up. For example: Checkered Flag will increase the car's top speed, wrapped package gives the player a free lap, stop sign will stop the opponents for a short time and the milk bottle causes the opponents to lose traction.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Monkey Puncher is a game where the goal is to train a monkey to fight in boxing matches in order to save your kidnapped sibling. You can choose to play as either a boy or a girl character; the one you do not pick is your sibling. </p>\n<p>Shortly after starting the game you are given your first monkey, Freddy. You can train him in skipping, using a punchbag, doing sit-ups, running and even going shopping. There is also a sixth activity, called sparring. These activities work to improve his speed, power, strength, stamina, knowledge and (for the latter activity) all of these, although only by a small amount.</p>\n<p>In all of the aforementioned apart from shopping, you train your monkey by getting him to copy your actions; your actions are controlled by the rhythmic pressing of the A button. After a while, your monkey should be able to imitate your actions with ease, eventually being able to start the activity without prompting. In regards to shopping, you can send him out to buy what you want from a selection of items, or just let him go out and buy what he likes. This is a good way of obtaining certain items that are otherwise unobtainable. The rarity of items and the accuracy of which items it brings home from your shopping list increases as its knowledge does. Sparring involves pitting your own monkey against a computer controlled one in order to raise every stat by a small amount. Finally, you can 'date' your monkeys, either with each other, with a friend's monkey or in the dating shop available within the game. This is a good way of obtaining monkeys with higher stats, depending on which monkeys you breed and with whom. </p>\n<p>During boxing matches, you do not have direct control over your monkey, but in between bouts you can do things such as refill its health, stamina, or both. You can also advise it on what strategy to use against its opponent. These matches are won by either a count or by KO'ing the opponent, however if time runs out before there is a clear winner, the winner is the monkey who is left with the most health at the end of the match.</p>",

Due to the obvious hardware limitations, the stages in this version have been designed in 2D, and there are also differences in gameplay.</p>\n<p>The character roster includes four X-Men (Cyclops, Wolverine, Storm and Gambit) and five evil Mutants (Magneto, Toad, Mystique, Sabretooth and Pyro). There are also two additional secret characters, whose unlocking codes are revealed upon beating the game's story mode.</p>\n<p>In addition to the story mode, in which one character takes on all the others in consecutive fights, there is a training mode, battle mode (featuring teams of three characters each), survival mode (one character taking on all others with only a single bar of health) and a versus mode utilizing the Game Link cable.</p>\n<p>The Game Boy's two buttons are used for kicks and punches (or basic mutant abilities like Cyclops' eye beam). During a fight, a rage bar will slowly fill, which allows using powerful special attacks activated through button combos.</p>",

Four buttons are required to play - left and right on the Control Pad, and the A and B buttons. The game screen is split in half. The top half contains eight columns, followed by a striped line, and then an empty white area. To the left of the game screen is the time bar. As you complete rounds, the bar increases. When the bar reaches the top of the clock, the level is complete. If your white area fills up beyond the striped lines, the game is over.</p>\n<p>Each round has eight notes played in a specific rhythm. After they are played, they play again, and this time, after each note is played, circles fall down the columns. Your goal is to press a button when the circles hit the striped line, which turns them into colored circles with either arrows, A or B on them. These then land in the bin. If you miss hitting a note, the circles turn into black angry face circles, which are more difficult to clear. Perform enough beats correctly and happy face circles will appear - these act as wildcards.</p>\n<p>When three or more colored circles line up horizontally, they clear from the screen and points are scored. While you could complete levels by simply pressing the same button in time over and over, the other buttons can be used to set up combos, allowing for bigger points. In addition, if you press a note incorrectly, sometimes a different button symbol will fall instead, which you must then strategically try to clear.</p>",

The goal is to win all 9 gold medals by obtaining more points than the competition. Arcade mode is the same, except all championships and stages, as well as Jeremy McGrath, are unlocked from the start.\nThe difference between championships is the engine size - with larger (thus faster) bikes, the player has less time to react, and going head to head into the edge of the track can be a matter of a simple bump in 80cc to a spectacular flip into the stands in 250cc, also because it becomes a lot harder to do sharp turns in a limited space.</p>\n<p>While it can be played as a straightforward racing game, by performing tricks the player can obtain some powerups - a bomb will knock down the next opponent, the arrow temporarily boosts bike stats and the shield allows the player to barge into one opponent, knocking him off his bike. There is one big catch - the skull and bones knock the player out of his bike, which can prove to be decisive in a close race.</p>",

You play Max Mutig (\"Max Courageous\") and must find out why the Volcano on Happy Hippo Island has suddenly become active again. An important element of the game is collecting water drops and putting out the fires that result from the volcanic eruption. On your way to the volcano you meet several of your Hippo friends who will teach you new skills such as climbing, diving and throwing nuts at dangerous animals.</p>\n<p>The game is divided into six areas that consists of three levels each. It is not possible to save the game; instead you get a password after completing each three-level area. This password allows you to start the game at this point later.</p>",

        "description": "<p>As the young Sebastian, gamers take the role of the son of a brilliant scientist who has discovered a means to travel through time. Time travel has already taken place in this reality, however, and Sebatian's first mission is to use his father's discovery to return to the past and destroy an earlier time machine, which upset the balance of power in a past war and led to dangerous realities in their present. Just as Sebastian enters the machine to travel back to the past, he watches helplessly as his father is kidnapped and taken prisoner.</p>\n<p><em>Hands of Time</em> features an overhead view and six levels, each of which is comprised of a small overworld with various objectives. Much of the game requires completing item-swapping sequences in order to progress, while dealing with enemy soldiers along the way. You have a small pistol with infinite ammo. You can collect better weapons, though their ammo is limited. There are no difficulty levels and no multiplayer; you can jump to any of the six levels by use of a password system.</p>",

While each level starts with Milo Thatch, the main character of the movie, at certain points of a level (represented with a radio), players can switch the active character. Many obstacles can only be overcome by certain characters which means the switching mechanic has to be used frequently.</p>",

In each level, the player's goal is to flip a switch to open a cage, then grab the puzzle piece inside before the gate closes. The player can switch between the three characters at any time. Mary-Kate can jump higher, and the other two characters can jump on her head to reach high ledges. Ashley is the only one who can flip switches, and can pick up and throw Clue to move him or knock out enemies. Clue can be used as a platform, can fit through small spaces, and can swim. Enemies include monkeys, bats, and rats, and there are hazards such as spikes and crumbling platforms. If the player is having trouble reaching the puzzle piece, he or she can instead collect three clues scattered around the level, which will explain how to reach the puzzle piece.</p>\n<p>50 levels are included, split across five cases. A password is given after every case, for resuming play at a later time.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The adaptation of Disney's 1999 animated film <em>Tarzan</em> for the Game Boy Color is a side-scrolling platformer. In 23 levels, the player controls Tarzan (first as a child, later as an adult), his gorilla friend Terk, and Tarzan's love Jane.</p>\n<p>In Tarzan's and Terk's levels, the goal is always to collect a set number of bananas, then to find their friend to exit the level. Being creatures of the jungle, Tarzan's and Terk's abilities include swinging on vines, swimming in deep water, climbing plant-covered walls and moving through even the thickest forest quickly. Various animals like baboons, warthogs, snakes and fish populate the stages and might hurt the heroes. But since Tarzan and friends don't kill other beings, the enemies should be avoided or evaded instead. Jane is not as agile as the other two characters, so in her levels, there is no vine swinging or banana collecting. She comes equipped with an umbrella, though, which can be used to drive away enemies.</p>\n<p>In the early part of the game, there are several bonus stages: young Tarzan must escape from an elephant stampede, avoiding incoming tree boughs and collecting bananas. The game also includes two boss fights: the first against Sabor the leopardess, who killed Tarzan's parents, and the second against Clayton the gorilla hunter.</p>\n<p>The game has a unique two-player mode called \"Hide 'n 'Seek\". One player places his character somewhere in the jungle, then hands the Game Boy over to a friend, who has a limited amount of time to find it. Finally, the game also supports the Game Boy printer for printing out pictures that can be created by combining different backgrounds and character graphics.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Tom has captured Jerry's five friends: Duckling, Uncle Peco, Tyke, Tuffy and Muscles and has locked them up in five different locations, and it's up to the player (as Jerry) to rescue them. The game features a total of five levels, and all have the same objective: find a way to get to Jerry's friends. The player moves Jerry around, avoiding enemies and obstacles while collecting musical notes. In each level, Jerry meets two characters: Angel Jerry and Devil Jerry, who give Jerry hints and tips. There are doors leading to mini games, and players have to collect a certain number of musical notes (which is shown above each door) to gain access. These mini games are designed with young players' skill in mind. After completing a mini game, players acquire items which can be used to solve puzzles later on. Mini games may repeat with increasing difficulty as players proceed in the game. Once one of Jerry's friends is found, Jerry will need to defeat a \"boss\" to proceed to the next level.</p>\n<p>The game's graphics are in 2D. Players have a choice among English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch and Danish. The game knows no save function. In order to choose a level, players have to enter the right passwords.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A platoon of Colonial Marines, en route to Earth from a training mission, are awakened from hypersleep by a distress signal from the space freighter Thanatos. Ordered to board the massive ship and investigate the situation, they find themselves inside a nightmare: a massive infestation of xenomorphs. The mission is clear: clear the ship of hostiles and rescue any survivors.</p>\n<p><em>Aliens: Thanatos Encounter</em> is a top-down action game taking its main inspiration from the second film in the <em>Alien</em> franchise. While usually the goal in any of the more than a dozen levels of the game is simply to survive and find the exit, in some levels certain objectives must be achieved. These may be simply killing all aliens and rescuing all survivors, or finding a keycard to open the level exit. Before each level, the player can choose from five different characters, all rated differently in speed and stamina (i.e. health). Should a marine be drained of health, he or she is not killed, but captured. Another character can attempt a rescue and is given 200 seconds. If the captured soldier is not found within that time span, that character is removed from the roster for the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>To fight the aliens, the marines can draw on a variety of guns, most of them featured prominently in the movie. Besides a standard-issue pistol, there are shotguns, pulse rifles, flame throwers, grenade launchers and smartguns to be found in the levels. Available from the start is the motion tracker radar, displaying both human survivors as well as hostile aliens. It requires a free hand, however, so the use of either two guns simultaneously or one of the heavier guns is not possible with the tracker equipped. Another item reappearing from the movie is the power loader (famously controlled by Ripley in the finale). Its use slows down the marine, but increases their health at the same time.</p>\n<p>The enemies include the entirety of the alien life cycle, from facehuggers to chestbursters, a variety of adult alien warriors, and a queen. At the start of the game, they only hurt the player by running into them, but at later stages they gain the ability to spit acid. Lost health can be regained by collecting and using first aid kits.</p>\n<p>Game progress is saved through the use of passwords.</p>",

But there's a catch, another spy is also on the same mission. Players have to sweep him out of their way and collect the items before he does!</p>\n<p>Players have a choice among four locations and between Black Spy and White Spy. Each location contains a certain number of levels, which all have the same objectives: get the briefcase, collect the four items and get to the exit door. Players can try to slow their competitor down by killing him by placing traps in the rooms (dynamite, coil, spring, bucket and a time bomb) or using weapons (fists, knife and stick) when encountering him. When getting killed, players will be redirected to the starting point and all collected items are lost. Players are provided with a map which shows how many rooms there are and what is inside each room (trap, players' counterpart, items). Players can never be killed off entirely. The game is only over when the counterpart gets all the items and escapes through the exit door.</p>\n<p>The graphics are in 2D. The player's process is saved via passwords. The player can play against the computer or another player.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Rowlf, Gonzo the Great, Sam the Eagle and Swedish Chef all decide to travel back to the past using a big time machine built by Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker. Somehow the time machine breaks down, and sends the friends to unexpectedly different time locations. Now it's up to their friends - Animal and Kermit - to go to these locations and bring them back home.</p>\n<p><em>Jim Henson's Muppets</em> is an arcade game based on the TV program <em>The Muppets Show</em>. Players control either Animal or Kermit to different time locations which hold their friends. There are a total of 6 locations. Players can freely choose the location they want to play. Each location contains 3 selectable levels and an unlockable level (can only be played after finishing the selectable levels). The selectable levels have the same objective: find your way to the goal. The unlockable is where you encounter with a boss and save your friend. Animal fights using his drum sticks, while Kermit throws paper planes at enemies. Enemies (except the bosses) cannot identify the players' character, therefore don't fight at all. They simply just move from side to side. There are some items that aid players during the game: food (increase health), heart (give players one life), drum sticks (when playing as Animal)/paper planes (when playing as Kermit). Pressing a combination of button can enable Animal and Kermit to use special moves: Animal's earthquake and Kermit's super high jump.</p>\n<p>The graphics are in 2D. Players can save their process by choosing \"Save\" in the level choosing menu. At the beginning of a level or when players die, Statler and Waldorf will present exchanging a short conversation about the level.</p>",

The game is entirely shown from a top-down view and offers no surprises when it comes to controls: first the player sets the direction of the cue and changes the spin by changing the dot on a miniature ball shown in the right hand corner. Lastly the power of the shot is determined with a power bar on which a line moves from the left to right (and vice versa) and the player has to press the button when it is at the desired position.</p>",

The plot basically centers on an Egyptian priest who was mummified in his time and later resurrected in 1926. Now he threatens to destroy the world.</p>\n<p>It concentrates on exploring tombs and getting the artifacts inside. In most of the 46 levels, the player has access to three protagonists with different abilities: Evelyn can transport items and jump high, Rick can shoot with his pistols to kill enemies or use a sniper rifle to hit far away switches and Jonathan can use explosives. Each of the characters has their own life bars and the player can switch instantly between them. It is necessary to put all three characters to good use to solve the puzzles and platforming challenges the game offer. It is possible to bring a level to an unwinnable state, but there is a function to reset the level without penalty.</p>",

During the tournament, the player has the possibility to upgrade the car, e.g. a better engine or a speed enhancement, and adjust the damper and tires according to the known weather conditions of the next race. The effectiveness of the car components wears down over the course of the tournament. Other available playing modes are single rallies, time races and duels with a human opponent.</p>",

Brian, the hero from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6688/quest-64/\">Quest 64</a>, has to beat the levels by collecting all crystals. However, the whole screen is filled with dirt which is removed by simply walking into it; clearing a walking path for the monsters with the deadly touch. Brian's main weapon is his magic staff which shoots a powerful blast, but needs to recharge for a while before it can be used again. An alternative weapon are the chests which stand around the levels and are subject to gravity: digging the dirt under it causes it to fall down. A chest to the head is unhealthy for both Brian and his enemies. There are also power-ups to collect, e.g. higher speed or more firepower.</p>",

A while ago the station vanished but now it is back on full collision course towards Earth. Of course humanity sends squads out there to end the threat, but everyone but the robot Evo gets lost. The player takes the role of Evo who has to solve 35 levels in order to save Earth.</p>\n<p>The unique characteristic of the game is that Evo has the ability to take control over any robot animal he meets. In fact, he is required to do so because his life energy rapidly decreases when outside of a host. All those animals have different abilities which are used to solve the numerous puzzles found in the levels. There are varying goals to complete in each level which range from destroying a machine to guiding sheep to their pens.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Pitfall: Beyond the Jungle</em> is a side-scrolling platformer in which the player controls Pitfall Henry Jr. who discovered a portal to another dimension. There he has to beat four worlds with overall 15 levels in order to save the people from the evil Scourge. </p>\n<p>As with all <em>Pitfall</em> games, the focus is on skillful platforming and jumping. Harry can perform multiple jumping variants (regular jump, long jump, high jump, and a short but high jump forward) which are performed together with the directional buttons and need to be mastered in order to beat the game. Examples of typical obstacles are vines which need to be grabbed mid-air and floating snags where Harry can hook in his axe in. This axe is also the only weapon which can be used to kill the enemies which drain Harry's life energy when their attacks are successful. The premise is the same as in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9527/pitfall-3d-beyond-the-jungle/\">PlayStation version</a>, but the rest of the game is unrelated.</p>",

As always the goal is to keep the ball on the table as long as possible and accumulating points for the high score by hitting obstacles like bumpers.

Unfortunately Zorro gets captured and is imprisoned. 20 years later he manages to escape prison and trains a successor to continue his quest.</p>\n<p>Regarding gameplay, this is a side-scrolling platformer with a focus on fencing. The fighting mechanics allow Zorro to perform different moves, including blocking, in order to hit the enemies.

        "description": "<p>In <em>Billy Bob's Huntin'-n-Fishin'</em> the player takes the role of Billy Bob, an obese redneck, who wants to win the heart of his love Daisy Mae. But she makes high demands: her lover needs to be a skilled hunter and fisherman. Two attributes which don't fit Billy. The only way to change this is by solving a variety of simple mini games, e.g. a shooting gallery or catching worms by walking to the hole and pressing the button with the correct timing. Those mini games can be tackled in any order and when all in a category (fishing or hunting) are finished, the player gets access to the main assignment. This plays out with another, slightly more complex mini game. All this has to be repeated five times with increasing difficulty in order to beat the game.</p>",

During the matches, the opponents try to perform moves while both wrestlers are close together (basically by holding a direction and pressing buttons with the correct timing) to diminish the opponent's energy. This is necessary so his shoulders can be held to the mat for three seconds, which ends the match. One speciality of this game is the possibility to leave the ring and fight in the locker room or on the street. Besides the career mode (trying to win the WCW title by passing through lower leagues with lower difficulty) and single matches against the AI, there is also the option to play against another human participant.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Carl Lewis Athletics 2000</em> is a sports game focusing on Decathlon and its ten disciplines: pole vault, long jump, shot put, discus throw, javelin throw, high jump and running (100, 110 hurdles, 400 and 1500 metres). The controls follow the traditional mechanics: rhythmic button mashing, followed if necessary by pressing an action button. Besides the traditional championship mode, the player can also participate in the arcade mode in which a certain performance must be met in order to qualify to the next event. Unlockable by winning the Decathlon is a special mode with three additional disciplines: hurdles (200 and 400 metres) and 100 metres relay race.\nThe player creates an athlete who is saved on the cartridge and can be improved by training. </p>\n<p>Up to two players can participate simultaneously; some disciplines also offer a hot-seat option with only one cartridge. Best times and a ghost can be transferred via infrared. A side effect of this feature is the possibility to race against the own ghost.</p>",

The levels itself are relatively open and have to be explored in order in order to find the cats, especially by using Tweety's flutter ability. The player has to tap a button rapidly in order to keep him in the air longer. </p>\n<p>On the other hand, he has no standard attack and has to use items found in the levels, e.g. banana peels or acorns. The cats have to be overwhelmed with those items to get access to their paws. Of course there are also other enemies which take away a part of Tweety's life energy when touched. There is also a two-player mode in which the participants try to get as many paw imprints as possible in a limited amount of time.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX</em> on the Game Boy Color is based on developer HotGen's earlier <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6487/road-champs-bxs-stunt-biking/\">Road Champs</a> and uses that game's engine for the handheld adaptation of Activision's Tony-Hawk-style <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5362/mat-hoffmans-pro-bmx/\">BMX game</a>.</p>\n<p>The player can choose from one of eight professional BMX bikers, each with unique signature moves. Game modes include a comprehensive training section, where in five areas, basic controls as well as all manner of air, grind and combo tricks are taught. The main mode is the career: in each level, a number of goals must be completed to earn magazine covers, which in turn unlock further levels. Goals include reaching high scores (including time challenges), finding and collecting stars or letters, and performing certain tricks or trick combinations, sometimes without any crashes in between. Next to the goals, there are also competitions that award medals when one finishes in the top three scores for a level. Career mode consists of five different levels, featuring dirt, street and vert areas. The free ride mode allows one to practice unlocked levels without limits or restrictions. The final game mode is a time trial: the goal is to reach the end of a special track within a time limit, where performing tricks increases available time.</p>\n<p>The game shows the player's biker from a side-scrolling perspective. Movement in the levels is not free-roaming, but limited to lanes that can only be switched at certain points. Tricks are performed through button combinations when in the air or at certain objects. Performing moves without bailing raises a power bar, that when full, allows the biker's signature moves to be performed.</p>\n<p>Progress in the game is saved through use of a password feature.</p>",

Players control both monstrous stars of the film, Sulley and Mike, across 12 levels.</p>\n<p>After a simple tutorial level in Sulley's apartment, the game begins in earnest at the Monsters, Inc. scream factory, and continues through locations from the film, including children's bedrooms, the streets of Monstropolis and the Himalayas. Goals in a level might either be simply finding the exit or alternatively collecting a specific number of items (like Mike's paperwork or the parts of a sled) or performing certain tasks (like scaring five children). To avoid taking damage, Mike and Sulley must take care not to touch either children's toys, or, once they are on the run, other monsters. In later levels, Child Detection Agency agents search for the duo, and their touch means the instant loss of a life.</p>\n<p>Some levels dictate which of the two characters is controlled, others leave that choice to the player. Mike and Sulley have different abilities. Sulley can push objects around, climbing on top to reach higher places as well as break through barriers by dashing into them, or hang onto ledges. Mike can double jump and crawl into tight spaces. Both also have different attacks - Mike can throw cans of Blort cola and Sulley can throw toys.</p>\n<p>Powerups to be collected are Blort cans, which in addition to being Mike's ammunition function as health - being damaged only means losing a few cans. There are also boxes of Chinese takeout food (collect 10 for an extra life) and teddy bears (instant one up).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Keep the Balance!</em> is a puzzle game, where the goal is to balance a big weighing scale. The longer it stays in balance, the more points are gained. To do this, the player uses a catapult to throw objects needed to balance the scale that are coming from the left and the right of the screen on a conveyor belt. As these objects differ in weight, the player needs to carefully choose on which scale they're going to throw each one of them.\nTo make things worse, all kinds of trouble appear on screen, making it progressively more challenging: these can range from a crocodile that eat objects to a joker that throw around playing cards, offsetting a carefully balanced scale.\nThe game features five different game worlds, each divided into 16 levels.</p>",

This cartridge was then released, containing various designs of Mario characters, enemies, and items, which can be sewn as patterns using the Jaguar sewing machine.</p>\n<p>The concept is similar to an earlier Mario game for the Famicom Disk System, <em>I am a Teacher: Super Mario Sweater</em>. A follow up was planned, <em>Jaguar Mishin Sashi Senyou Soft: Kirby Family</em>, but was cancelled.</p>",

The story is similar to previous games: the Red Star army fights against the White Moon army.</p>\n<p>The goal is invariable, the player must destroy all enemy forces or capture the enemy's capital city. The player can buy various units - soldiers, vehicles, tanks, planes, helicopters, or boats. <em>Game Boy Wars 3</em> is more difficult than others games in the series as the player must have facilities and materials to build new units. Battles and other actions like sieges are shown as short animated sequences.</p>\n<p>The game has 60 maps in skirmishes (standard mode) and 45 campaign missions. <em>Game Boy Wars 3</em> also features a Beginner Mode</p>",

When the town is attacked by monsters, Brian go on a quest to restore peace and harmony.</p>\n<p>The game is a top-down RPG. The player moves on the map, talks to various characters, and fights against enemies, like crocodiles, wolves or knights. Brian can use four elements - Fire, Water, Earth and Wind - to cast spells, and combine them to create special moves. He can also make physical attacks, although those are weaker. Battles are turn-based: the player moves on a square grid, and chooses his actions. He can also dodge attacks from enemies.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Next to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4833/wwf-attitude/\">3D versions on consoles</a>, Acclaim's 1999 wrestling game <em>WWF Attitude</em> was also released in a 2D version for the Game Boy Color. It is similar to developer Crawfish Interactive's previous Game Boy title <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/52125/wwf-war-zone/\">WWF War Zone</a>, with the main differences being the addition of color, several new game modes and an all-new line-up of 20 wrestlers.</p>\n<p>Returning modes include training, single matches, tag team matches and cage matches, as well as the Challenge mode, in which the player's goal is to earn the WWF title by beating the current holder, starting from the very bottom of the rankings. To get a chance at the title fight, wrestlers with higher rankings must be beat in single matches, and it is also necessary to fight grudge (cage) matches against wrestlers in lower places. The new Career mode is a series of consecutive fights against all other 19 wrestlers in the game. Also new is the King of the Ring mode, an eight-wrestler single-elimination tournament. Progress in Challenge and Career modes is saved via passwords.</p>\n<p>In the ring, three of the Game Boy's buttons (A, B and Select) are used for various moves, including attacks, grapples and drops. Each wrestler has their signature finishing move available, but unlike in <em>War Zone</em>, every finisher is activated in the same way.</p>\n<p>Like in <em>War Zone</em>, short biographies of the featured wrestlers are available from the main menu.</p>",

Drinking the enemies' blood replenishes health. Dracula must also solve some puzzles by moving crates, flipping switches, opening doors, or lowering drawbridges. He can talk to other characters. The game has eleven levels, some of which take place outside the castle. In those levels, Dracula must avoid the deadly sunbeams.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Play as the child Cody, whose grandpa has just retired and is leaving him with the family business, a Robopon Dispatching Company. The player starts with one Robopon, named Sunny, and must travel Porombo island as he/she collects Robopon and uses them to battle other Robopon Collectors. The collectors primarily played against are known as the \"Legend 7\", who are the top-ranked collectors of Robopon on the island. When Cody beats a Legend 7 member, he takes their rank.</p>\n<p>To improve Robopon, they must be upgraded by adding software or other parts to them. Each part has a certain amount of space for storing software and will determine what attacks can be used by the Robopon. Software can be mixed to generate special attacks.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, <em>Robopon</em> plays a lot like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pok%C3%A9mon+series\">Pok\u00e9mon</a>. Fighting is turn based and is between two Robopon owners who tell their Robopon to issue attacks or go on the defensive. Robopon can be healed in mid-battle with spells (which can be bought in town shops or stumbled upon between towns) or taken to a Robopon dispatch center and healed in their machine. One thing where <em>Robopron</em> differs from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pok%C3%A9mon+series\">Pok\u00e9mon</a> is that in battle, a defeated Robopon sometimes will drop add-on items which get claimed by the winner. When a new game is started, the game asks for the player's birth date which is actually used by the game to select the first Robopon the player will start with. </p>\n<p>In Japan, <em>Sun Version</em> was released alongside <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/77117/robot-ponkottsu-star-version/\">Star Version</a> and can connect to that version via infrared sensor. There are 153 different kinds of Robopon, and only by trading between versions can all of them be collected in one save.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Power Rangers: Time Force</em> for the Game Boy Color is a platformer based on the 2001 version of the long-running franchise. In this incarnation, the Power Rangers are time police from the year 3000. Various criminals have escaped to different time zones and the rangers must apprehend them.</p>\n<p>The game takes place over eight levels. For some levels, the order in which to take them on is up to the player. Locations include cities in present day, past and future, a prehistoric jungle, a futuristic underwater base and more. At the start of each level, the player can select from one of five rangers (Red, Yellow, Pink, Green and Blue), all of which differ slightly in the stats vitality, skill, power and speed. The goal in each level is to find and defeat the escaped criminal within a time limit. On the way there are monsters to be fought and traps to be avoided. For defeating enemies or removing obstacles, the rangers can choose between their fists, a fighting staff or a gun. The staff and gun drain energy which slowly refills on its own but can also be refilled quickly by collecting the appropriate powerup. Other powerups include a health refill, a clock that takes time off the time limit, and the ranger warp system, which allows the player to change their ranger mid-level.</p>\n<p>Starting in level three, simply defeating the boss is not enough: once he is down, the Power Rangers must use their Megazord mech (in either Red or Blue forms) to beat him again. These battles are similar to a traditional one-on-one fighting game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/276/star-wars-episode-i-racer/\">The game</a> based on the pod racing scenes from <em>Star Wars: Episode I</em> received a unique adaptation on the Game Boy Color.</p>\n<p>The game features 5 different planets with 4 tracks each for a total of 20 tracks. Only the first track from each planet is available from the start and the only available pod racer available to select is Anakin Skywalker's. Winning races unlocks further tracks on each planet and allows the player to choose the racers of the beaten opponents. When all four courses from a planet are won, a duel against Sebulba opens up. Winning it unlocks Sebulba's racer, but losing another race takes it away again. All racers differ in top speed, acceleration, turning rate and body strength (i.e. amount of damage the racer can take).</p>\n<p>Races are seen from a top-down view and are always one-on-one. Unlike in the film or the console game, there are no laps and the first racer to cross the finish line wins. When normal top speed is reached, a flashing light indicates that a turbo boost is available that allows the racer to reach its real top speed. The turbo shouldn't be used for more than a few seconds, though, because overusing it damages the racer. Crashing into the opponent or track obstacles also causes damage. Too much damage causes the racer to blow up, but the only real effect is some time loss, since it is put back on the track after a few seconds. It is possible to repair damage mid-race at the cost of speed and acceleration.</p>\n<p>The game offers a two-player mode via link cable and the cartridge has a rumble feature.</p>",

For each of the seven tracks, there's perilous terrain as well as jumps that, if not negotiated properly, can ruin a race for anyone. Once the three seasons are finished, Jeff Gordon will challenge the player to race against Team XS.</p>\n<p>A second player can join in the racing fun, using the Game Link Cable.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Love Hina Party</em> is one of several games based on a Love Hina manga, which in turn was made into anime. The basic story in Love Hina centers around a young boy, Keitaro Urashima, trying to fulfill his promise to a girl he shortly met as a child but whose name he has forgotten. Their promise was to study hard and get accepted at Tokyo University, where they could meet once again. While studying for exam, Keitaro is staying at his grandmother's hotel which seem to be inhabited by girls only. As a new manager of the hotel, he is having a plethora of ups and downs in his relationship with the girls, and one of them even turns out to be the very girl he made a promise to.</p>\n<p>This game puts you in shoes of Keitaro himself as he resumes his duties of a hotel manager. During adventure mode, you can check certain predefined locations and speak with characters you meet, sometimes selecting your answer during conversation. Sometimes during the story, the girls in Hinata apartments will ask you quiz questions about the Love Hina anime. The action mode in the game is done via four different mini-games which, unlike the adventure mode, use 3rd-person perspective.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Released in conjunction with a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3636/wwf-wrestlemania-2000/\">3D version on Nintendo 64</a>, the Game Boy color received its own version of <em>WWF Wrestlemania 2000</em>, with gameplay in 2D and a limited selection of wrestlers and modes.</p>\n<p>Players can select from 16 wrestlers for play in five single-player modes: Championship mode is the main story mode, leading the player's wrestler on a series of matches for the WWF title, with TV-style cutscenes between matches. Vs. mode allows for single matches between two wrestlers, while Tag Team mode features single two-versus-two matches. In Survivor Series mode, the player must assemble two teams of three wrestlers each. Fights are one-on-one, with the loser being removed from the roster, until one side's roster is empty. Finally, Gauntlet mode is a series of consecutive fights against all other wrestlers in the game. A training mode in which the opponent doesn't fight back is also available.</p>\n<p>A two-player mode is supported via the link cable: two players can match up in single matches, with normal and cage matches being available.</p>\n<p>During a fight, the ring is seen from the side and scrolls in all four directions. The Game Boy's two buttons are used for context-sensitive moves depending on where the opponent is located. When in a grapple, buttons plus control pad directions allow for more variety in moves. Each wrestler also comes with his own finishing move, activated through pushing Select while in a grapple. These moves can't be activated at any time, however: each wrestler has their own bio-rhythm and the finisher can only be unleashed when their rhythm is at its peak.</p>",

The selection of game modes is based on that from the main game as well: there are single races, tournaments and the cop chase mode. Tournament mode consists of seven different cups, which have to be won in order. The easier cups begin with only two laps, increasing to eight laps in the later ones. Winning cups unlocks tracks for the single race mode. Winning races earns money and upgrade points. Money is used to buy new cars and the upgrade points can be spent on better acceleration, traction or top speed as well as to buy power bursts, which give short speed boosts in a race. Progress is saved via battery.</p>\n<p>The cop chase mode offers four special police variations of the regular cars and is played on tracks unlocked in the tournaments. The goal is to hand out tickets to other cars on the track within a time limit of one minute by ramming into them with the siren activated. Each ticket gains $500 that add to the winnings from the tournaments.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Puzzle Master</em> is a falling block puzzle game similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Columns\">Columns</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Puyo+Puyo\">Puyo Puyo</a>. It is fantasy themed and the blocks here represents the four elements (water, fire, wood and rock) that have been corrupted by an evil goblin king. As these fall from the sky it's the player's job to arrange them so that a cluster of three or more elements of the same type is created. These elements will then be cleared from the playing field. When the player succeeds with doing this his Power Sword gets charged and when it's fully powered the level is completed. The player fails if the stack of elements reaches the top of the screen. But there are more challenges as some levels have monsters that throw indestructible skull blocks that quickly fills up the playing field. To combat these monsters the player has access to a limited supply of adventurer's tools. Some of these, like daggers and bombs, do direct damage on the target that it's dropped on but can also be used to help clearing the elements. Daggers will take out an entire column of elements while hearts act as a wildcard and potions remove all elements of a sort from the playing field. There are also keys that can be used to unlock chests or get access to new areas of the playing field. Some special puzzles exist too for the player to figure out. For example dropping a water element on a flower will give an extra tool.</p>\n<p>The game three modes: quest, time challenge and training. There are more than fifty levels split over five different realms. The fifth realms is only made available if the player succeeds in completing the first four and collects all the ancient objects.</p>",

Like in those games the objective is to destroy bricks with the use of a ball but with the difference that the paddle used to do so here is a dragon which when still curls up in a ball. For every ball that the player loses the dragon will shrink until there is nothing left of it. There is also a time limit for every level so the player can not take too long. Therefore it's possible to increase the speed level of the ball but there is no way to decrease it except by losing a ball (and restarting with a new one) or by getting a specific power up. Other power ups include those that add extra time or increase the dragon's movement speed. The player can also transform his dragon into other types of dragons that have special abilities. These become available as the player destroys bricks and is represented by a power gauge at the top of the screen. These abilities include freezing time, deflecting the ball in mid-air, shooting fireballs that destroy bricks and a web that can block off certain paths through the level. Random events featuring dragon gods can happen and will lead to different effects such as earthquakes or restored health.</p>\n<p>The game consists of one hundred levels with every tenth being a boss level. There is also a versus mode where two players can link up against each other. The players choose one of ten levels and compete in trying to clear the most bricks. For every five seconds the player with the least bricks cleared during that time gets an extra row of bricks added. The one that clears his screen first will win.</p>",

Enter Barbie and her Pet Rescue Center. It is her mission to pick up the stray animals, nurse them back to health and return them to their owners, all involving a variety of mini-games.</p>\n<p>The game starts at the main menu in the Rescue Center. By picking up the phone, Barbie learns which animal must be rescued next. Picking it up usually involves a side-scrolling vehicle ride to the destination (in a scooter, car or boat) in which Barbie must avoid or jump over obstacles. Most animals can then simply be picked up, but a few require a mini-game to be completed, including a safari photo shoot, the ice cream craze (a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9001/breakout/\">Breakout</a> variant) and catching apples in a basket.</p>\n<p>Once the animal is back in the Rescue Center, its health and happiness ratings need to be increased to maximum. Health is taken care of in the check-up room. Available options are bandages, vitamins, food, and brushing or bathing the animal. Different animals react differently to the various treatments. Hints on what to use for each one are available. Happiness is taken care of in the play room. Playing with animals involves one of three different mini-games: Rascal Run-Around (a find-the-exit maze game), Snacktime Challenge (a concentration/memory game pairing animals with their favorite food) and Critter Keep-Away (a pinball variant in which a cat's paws are the flippers and must kick back a ball of yarn).</p>\n<p>Once an animal is healthy and happy, it can be returned to its owner, involving another vehicle drive along an obstacle course. Before it is returned for good, another mini-game follows. The animal needs to be matched with its parent, requiring a jumbled up picture to be put together again from three parts within a time limit.</p>\n<p>Each animal returned provides Barbie with a rescue certificate, which can be looked at from the office. Progress in the game is saved via passwords.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Kigantou Hihou Densetsu</em> (Eng. \"The Legend of Treasure on a Strange Rock Island\") is a top-down adventure game from <em>Meitantei Conan</em> series featuring Edogawa Conan (real name is Kudou Shin'ichi) as a protagonist on a case to solve the mystery on the Kigantou island. However, Conan is not the only character you can control in the game, beside him you can control Shin'ichi's girlfriend Ran, her father, the renowned detective thanks to Conan, Kogoro, Ran's high-school girlfriend, Sonoko, and Conan's classmates Mitsuhiko, Ayumi and Genta. Based on the character you control, certain areas may be accessible or inaccessible, and certain dialogues and dispositions from other characters may vary.</p>\n<p>The story starts with Togawa sisters, Satomi and Miki, receiving a golden statue. They lost their parents at an early age, never knowing what actually happened to them. One day, a letter came from a wealthy person living on an island somewhere in the western Japan Sea. Upon receiving this letter, they realized the golden statue belongs to the place from which the letter was sent. If this is a family heirloom, could the person who sent the letter be someone related to them? Can they know what happened to Satomi and Miki's parents? As Conan and the others opened the Togawa sisters' request, they decided to help uncover the mystery behind their lineage and golden statue and set off on a trip to the solitary island in question where ships travel to only twice a week. As they arrive on the island of strange shape, the notice the residents of an island village appear a bit weird, and there seem to be history behind the wealthy island family. And to top it all, the murder in front of the wealthy looking western-style estate occurred just in front on them and the murderer ran away from the scene of the crime. It's Conan's task to solve all the mysteries and catch the killer, for by his own words, the truth is always only one.</p>",

During the holidays, Conan and Ran decide to meet at a certain cafe. While there, Ran runs into her classmate Miki by chance, who is part-time working at that very cafe. In turn, Miki calls them to come to her place where she tells them about her worrying about her sister Satomi. Apparently she said she's going on a trip as she was heading out, but she never called or told Miki where she went. She is a rather methodical person, which makes her behavior suspiciously strange, and Miki asks Ran and Conan to help her find her sister. Also, before she went out, she was acting strange according to Miki. After listening in more detail and agreeing to help Miki look for Satomi, Conan and Ran head to Satomi's room to look for clues about her whereabouts. There they find out what was a direction to a secluded old temple and with that as their only lead to go on, they set out to find Satomi.</p>\n<p>Exploring locations is done in top-down perspective which also allows you to switch between characters, thus not controlling Conan alone. The map system shows you your current location. Message system is used for dialogues with other characters which uses typical first person view displaying the talking character and the text below the character image. On your investigation while searching for clues and talking to other characters, you will obtain keywords which lets you think the case through and after collecting the necessary keywords, you can start the reasoning process. Conan also keeps track on characters he meets, and you can access character profiles from the in-game menu, the same way you access keywords or map system.</p>",

The series are centered around a high-school student, Hajime Kindaichi, who has the knack for solving crimes, much like Shinichi Kudou, better known as Conan Edogawa from <em>Meitantei Conan</em> series. The game is presented in a visual novel style with typical commands for reading through the on screen text and going though the message log. The investigation screen is done in a form of top-down map where you can investigate different locations and look for clues.</p>\n<p>Akira Kawai, a first-year student of a Fudou high-school received a mysterious letter with ominous sketch and the text saying \"I'll be waiting at the Shiomisou inn.\", sender or reason for sending this letter is unknown. Upon reading this himself, Hajime Kindaichi, along with Miyuki Nanase decided to check if there's more to the meaning of the letter or if it's nothing but a prank of a sort. Upon arriving at the Shiomisou inn, which was in a rather secluded and silent place surrounded by mountain on one side, and a sea on the other, he noticed there are only three more guests besides them. Could one of them be the sender of this letter? The night came swiftly and the weather turned gloomy. There and then, Hajime runs into Kengo Akechi, a detective investigating a report of a supposed seeing of a killer in the area from a 10-year old case. With approaching storm, the scream echoes through the hallway and first in the series of murders engulfs this hotel in an aura of tension. Kindaichi and Akechi are now more than ever determined to get to the bottom of this and catch the murderer behind this.</p>",

It offers eight licensed off-road trucks from manufacturers like Jeep, Dodge, Ford and Subaru and seven international areas to race in, each with three different tracks. Further cars and tracks are available as hidden bonuses. Races are seen from a top-down perspective.</p>\n<p>The modes are similar to those in the developer's earlier <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/66646/test-drive-6/\">Test Drive 6</a>. The main gameplay mode is Tournament Mode. Seven different cups are available that have to be taken on in order, unlocking tracks in the process. Winnings from races can be spent to purchase new cars. After every race, power up points are awarded that can be used to improve the car in acceleration, top speed, traction and gearing. It is also possible to equip the car with a GPS, which provides a map of the track during a race, and with further enhancements, the locations of all drivers. Also available are power bursts and power winches. Bursts give a short speed burst, while winches can be used to quickly reset the car to a checkpoint if it becomes stuck at an obstacle like mud or water.</p>\n<p>Single Race mode allow players to race on unlocked tracks with their purchased cars. In Patrol Chase mode, players can select from special cop variants of three different cars, with the goal being chasing down the other cars on the track and giving them tickets by ramming into them.</p>\n<p>The game cartridge (US version only) has a rumble feature that lets players experience all the bumps and rough terrain first-hand.</p>",

It offers single games for one or two players, a tournament mode consisting of four rounds and progress stored via passwords, and a practice option that allows setting up any pin combination to knock down.</p>\n<p>Before a game, players can select from five different characters, each with different statistics, and select whether they are right- or left-handed. After aligning the ball on the alley, the throwing is done with four consecutive button pushes. The first starts the curve meter, while the second stops it to select the ball curve. The third determines the power of the throw on the power meter, and the final one must be matched to a goal spot for best accuracy.</p>",

One day, a young man named Shigeki uses his D-Shot and is accidentally transported to another world which is inhabited by various cell phone-owning monsters called Denj\u016b. The Denj\u016b love to battle one another, and are willing to team up with humans who can help them hone their skills. These humans are known as T-Fangers, and Shigeki decides to become one and help solve problems in the Denj\u016b world.</p>\n<p>Shigeki starts with a single Denj\u016b partner, and can befriend more by exchanging phone numbers with ones he has defeated in battle. Up to three of Shigeki's Denj\u016b can participate in a single battle, but since only the starter Denj\u016b travels with him, he will need to call the others and invite them to join the fight. Depending on where these other Denj\u016b are stationed, it can potentially take several turns before they've arrived at the battlefield. A Denj\u016b may have one of six elemental alignments, each of which trumps another in a rock-paper-scissors-style succession.</p>\n<p>Denj\u016b can evolve to become stronger and gain new attacks, and there are three methods of doing so. Natural evolution takes place once a Denj\u016b has hit a certain level threshold. Mod evolution happens when Denj\u016b are fused with certain items, and while it is easier than other forms of evolution, it typically provides the worst stat gains of any method. Finally, experimental evolution occurs when a Denj\u016b is fused with DNA samples from other species.</p>\n<p><em>Power Version</em> is one of two versions of <em>Telefang</em>, the other being <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/74170/keitai-denju-telefang-speed-version/\">Speed Version</a>. The two versions have different sets of available Denj\u016b, though players with different versions can trade with one another to complete their collections.

In battle, the player moves their Pok\u00e9mon around a grid-based map, and at the end of a turn, can choose to use an item or attack an enemy if in range. A Pok\u00e9mon can use either a standard attack, or one of four moves that consume SP, this game's version of mana; either way, once an attack has been used, any enemy that is in range can use a counterattack. Also scattered across the map are treasure chests and houses that contain items.</p>\n<p>Pok\u00e9mon gain experience and level up through defeating enemies, and can evolve and learn new attacks once reaching certain level thresholds.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Simba's Mighty Adventure</em> is based on the Disney film <em>The Lion King</em> and its direct-to-video sequel <em>Simba's Pride</em>. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6332/disneys-the-lion-king-simbas-mighty-adventure/\">PlayStation version</a>, the Game Boy Color version presents the story as a traditional side-scrolling platformer, similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/66516/disneys-the-lion-king/\">earlier</a> <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/2077/the-lion-king/\">adaptations</a> of the original film.</p>\n<p>The game consists of 10 levels, with the first six based on <em>The Lion King</em> and the last four based on <em>Simba's Pride</em>. In the first four, players control Simba as a cub, and from then on as an adult. To get through the levels, Simba can run, jump and climb up on ledges. To defeat the various enemies (snakes, spiders, monkeys, frogs, scorpions and many other critters) Simba can jump on top of them, strike them with his claw or (as an adult only) roar at them to make them flee. Some of the levels end in boss fights. The fourth level, based on the stampede scene from the first film, is seen from a top-down perspective and the screen scrolls automatically. Level progress is saved via passwords.</p>\n<p>In all levels, Simba can pick up various collectibles. There are stars (collecting 100 gains an extra life), beetles (to refill or extend the health bar), a lion head (extra life), and parts of Simba's amulet. Collecting all five parts of the amulet gains an extra life and opens up a mini-game to be played before the next level. The games include Bug Drop (collecting bugs dropped from the top of the screen), Bug Tennis, Catch the Worms (picking up worms from holes and depositing them in a container) and Beetle Hunt (finding Pumbaa within a time limit, with yellow bugs increasing the score and red bugs decreasing the time limit). The mini games can also be played from the main menu.</p>\n<p>A mini-game exclusive for two players via link cable is called Tag: playing as Simba and Nala, the players try to hold on to a star for two minutes total. The star changes hands when the other player touches the star-carrier.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>NYR: New York Race</em> for the Game Boy Color is a futuristic racing game inspired by the 1997 French film <em>The Fifth Element</em>. Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9005/nyr-new-york-race/\">version for console and PC</a>, the handheld presents the races in a top-down view with fewer features and options.</p>\n<p>The game consists of several divisions of 2 tracks each. Only the first division is available from the start, others are unlocked by placing first in all races of earlier ones. At the beginning, only the taxi (as driven by Bruce Willis' character in the film) can be used. Further cars must be purchased with money won in the races (by placing first, second or third). Eight different cars are available to buy, differing in ratings for power, traction and shield strength. The more powerful cars can only be bought upon reaching higher divisions. Progress through the game is stored via passwords.</p>\n<p>Races are against three opponents, take place on circular courses and consist of four laps. The futuristic hovercars have the ability to change altitude, either driving on the ground or high in the air. Flying high is necessary for maximum speed, but there are obstacles on the track that can only be passed by driving under them. There are also power-ups that can only be picked up when on the ground. These include missiles, shields, speed boosts, slowdown bubbles and short-time invulnerability. An arrow is always in view and points out corners and, when in high altitude, obstacles.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>All-Star Baseball 2000</em> is the second portable installment of Acclaim's baseball series, and the first on the Game Boy Color. It is based closely on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/59991/all-star-baseball-99/\">previous year's game</a>, with the major changes being the addition of color graphics and the rosters and teams updated for the 1999 MLB season.</p>\n<p>All the same playing modes of the predecessor return: exhibition, season (now with four different possible lengths), playoffs, all-star game, Home Run Derby and batting practice. All 30 teams of the 1999 season are available.</p>\n<p>Gameplay remains largely unchanged from the previous year or even <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/60202/frank-thomas-big-hurt-baseball/\">Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball</a>. Pitching and batting are seen from behind home base, while during running and fielding the view switches to an isometric perspective of the field. Pitches are made by first aiming via height and direction meters, then choosing the pitching style and finally the speed. Batting is done in the traditional way by pushing buttons for either a swing or a bunt, with variations done through the D-Pad.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>BattleTanx</em> for Game Boy Color is an adaptation of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6448/battletanx/\">N64 game of the same name</a>. It puts its own spin on the original game's story, features adapted music tunes from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3669/battletanx-global-assault/\">the sequel</a>, and turns the free-roaming 3D action into a top-down 2D game.</p>\n<p>In a world where a virus has wiped out 99% of women, governments have fallen and power is in the hand of brutal tank gangs. Protagonist Griffin searches the former United States for his love Madison, a journey that will take him from Los Angeles to San Francisco, Las Vegas, New York and Washington D.C., fighting the most notorious gangs in each city.</p>\n<p>The game's main story mode consists of fifteen missions, three per city, all seen from a top-down perspective. The objectives vary between destroying all enemy tanks, collecting items or reaching a certain point on the map. Throughout the course of the game, players will control three different tanks, all with slightly different weapons and capabilities. Destroying enemy tanks leaves symbols that when picked up, restore health. Weapon power-ups to be found on the streets are homing missiles, reflective shots, and even a nuke. Limited invisibility and extra lives are also available.</p>\n<p>In story mode, progress is saved via passwords. The game's levels can be played independently from the story in battle mode.</p>",

Rapid Fire has two golfers swinging at the same time trying to reach the hole first, and is the only mode also available for two players via link cable. </p>\n<p>The game contains three extravagant 18-hole courses: Grand Canyon, Hawaii and Mt. Lava. During gameplay, a hole is seen from a top-down perspective. Before the shot is made, the club and the direction are selected. Making a swing follows the standard three-click method (start, power, accuracy). The shot is shown in an animated sequence seen from behind the golfer.</p>\n<p>A special twist comes into play with power-ups. These lie on the fairway and are picked up when the ball flies over them. They can be used for extra powerful shots, for making the opponent lose a stroke, for blowing their ball away with a whirlwind, and more.</p>",

Ringside commentary is provided via voice samples of Mills Lane.</p>\n<p>Game modes include Slugfest, Career and Vs Mode (via link cable). In Slugfest mode, players select one of the legends and take on the other nine in a ladder of matches. In Career mode, players create their own boxer by picking nickname and weight and setting stats from a point pool. The career then progresses through a variety of divisions with fights against smaller opponents, with the hope of progressing far enough to take on the champions. Between matches, stats can be increased through training sessions. Progress is saved via passwords.</p>\n<p>The fights are displayed in a 2D scrolling view of the ring, with the fighters drawn in a cartoony style with oversized heads. The controls allow for a variety of punches by combining the A, B and Start buttons with the D-Pad. Unlike in many other boxing games, there is only a single health bar that combines strength and stamina. When knocked down, button-mashing is necessary to get back up. In Slugfest mode, power-ups can be picked up that restore or increase strength, stamina or speed.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest</em> is the second entry in Nintendo's baseball series to appear on a handheld. Compared to the contemporary <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9096/ken-griffey-jrs-slugfest/\">N64 version</a>, the Game Boy Color version has a few less features, simpler controls and presents everything in traditional 2D graphics.</p>\n<p>Game modes include exhibition games, a full season (three different lengths), World Series and Home Run Derby. The game includes teams and player names of the 1998 season (but not the licensed stadiums of the N64 version), with the All-Star teams also included. During a season, players can be traded, and stats and standings are saved to battery-backed RAM.</p>\n<p>Gameplay follows a standard model of a view behind the pitcher for pitching and batting, and an overhead view of the field for running and fielding. Compared to other baseball games, the field view is rather close, and arrows help in locating the controlled players when they are out of view. Controls are based on the A and B buttons to select the action and the D-Pad for influencing direction during pitching and batting.</p>",

Regarding gameplay and graphics, it is very similar to developer Torus' earlier <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/2981/nba-jam-tournament-edition/\">NBA Jam Tournament Edition</a>, but with updated color graphics and animations, more modes and options, and updated teams and players.</p>\n<p>Game modes include single games (Head-to-Head), a full season, playoffs and a practice mode. All 29 NBA teams of the 1998-99 season are included, with five star players per team (each with their unique skills) available for playing. Selectable options include tag mode (for controlling both players on a team), power-ups (temporarily increase skills), hot spots (bonus points for scoring from a hot spot), juice mode (for accelerated gameplay), CPU skill and strategy (offensive, defensive or balanced) and more.</p>\n<p>Matches are seen from the side, and controls remain simple: three buttons (including Start) for turbo, passing and shooting, with the turbo button enhancing the other actions when pressed.</p>",

Like the original, it is a two-on-two arcade basketball game following the lineage of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/838/nba-jam-series/\">NBA Jam series</a>.</p>\n<p>It includes all 29 teams of the 1999-2000 NBA season, with over 100 featured players. Modes include exhibition games, a full season, playoffs and a practice mode. Options have been reduced compared to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/75153/nba-jam-99/\">NBA Jam 99</a>: length of quarters and overtime as well as AI difficulty can be set, and music and sound effects be turned on or off. </p>\n<p>Gameplay is seen from the side and follows the NBA Jam gameplay of old, with two buttons for passing and shooting (on defense, stealing and blocking) and a turbo button for faster running and enhanced actions, including spectacular over-the-top dunks. Season progress is saved via passwords, and the game includes several unlockable bonuses, including additional courts with a street or a jungle theme.</p>",

It offers a selection of boxers and options of the original game, with simplified controls and 2D graphics.</p>\n<p>From the start, the game includes 7 of the cartoony characters seen in the console versions; three further ones can be unlocked. The only two gameplay modes are Arcade (a single match) and Championship (a ladder against all other boxers in the game). All fights are best-of-three.</p>\n<p>Fights are seen from a slightly angled perspective of the ring. Controls allow for two different punches via A and B, an uppercut (button + Up) and a gut punch (button + Down). Landing clean hits fills the R-U-M-B-L-E meter, which, when full, allows the boxer to unleash a furious punching assault by pressing A+B. A standard health model with two different bars for strength and stamina is used.</p>\n<p>The game includes the licensed voice of Michael Buffer, who introduces the fighters and of course also spouts his trademark phrase that gives the game its name. The game also features FMV introductions for all fighters (taken from the console version), and, befitting the game's title, a cartridge with a rumble feature that allows players to feel the hits (US version only).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Blade</em> for Game Boy Color is a 2D side-scrolling action game inspired by the 1998 film of the same name. It presents its own story unrelated to the film: vampire hunter Blade, the Daywalker, investigates a previously unknown clan of vampires who pursue some sinister agenda.</p>\n<p>The game consists of several different types of gameplay: the main part is a side-scrolling brawler. Blade must move through various locations like an enemy base, the subway, the sewers, or Chinatown and beat up hordes of vampires with punches and kicks. Only two buttons (in combination with the D-Pad) are used for fighting, one for attacks and one for blocks. In addition, Blade can use his glave throwing blade weapon as a powerful extra attack, with only a limited number of uses per level.</p>\n<p>The second type of stage is a shooting gallery, with Blade stading at the center of the screen and vampires attacking from either the background or the left and right. Blade must kill them by moving a crosshair and firing his weapon, with different buttons used for targeting background and foreground. Similar to the glave in the brawler levels, Blade can use a limited amount of shotgun shots to take out several enemies at once.</p>\n<p>The third and final type are boss battles against very powerful vampires. These are seen from the side like the brawler levels, but limited to a single screen, and have Blade using his sword instead of his fists.</p>\n<p>All levels are time-limited by Blade's serum that limits his bloodthirst and must be finished before it runs out.</p>\n<p>There are several different ways through the game. Three different levels can be selected at the start, the order of which they are played in determining the game's difficulty. Exploring rooms and making choices in the game can lead to different paths by unlocking hidden levels and having enemies react differently to events.</p>",

It has little in common with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4188/army-men-sarges-heroes-2/\">the game of the same name on consoles</a>, having a completely different gameplay style and story.</p>\n<p>Players control soldiers of the Green Army in combat against the Tan Army through 30 levels. Before each mission, one of three characters can be selected: Vikki, Scorch, and Riff. Levels are seen from an isometric perspective. Mission objectives vary between search and destroy (find and kill all enemies), search and rescue (find an item or soldier), protection/escort (defend a base or friendly unit) and more. All action is vehicle-based, and each of the three characters comes with their own set of three craft, one each for land, air and sea-based missions. Vehicles are equipped with a primary and a more powerful secondary gun. Ammunition for the latter is limited but can be replenished by picking up the appropriate power-up, which is sometimes hidden inside enemy buildings that have to be destroyed first.</p>\n<p>Progress through the game is saved via passwords. Between levels, comic-style images illustrate the storyline.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Army Men 2</em> is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/75347/army-men/\">Army Men</a>. Like that game, it is a simplified adaptation of a PC game (<a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/2488/army-men-ii/\">Army Men II</a>) to the Game Boy Color.</p>\n<p>The game is very similar to its predecessor. Players control green army soldier Sarge through a number of missions, with the goal usually being to destroy a number of tan army enemies. The missions are organized into two campaigns (Field and Assault), each consisting of three to four maps with three to five missions each, for a total of 31 missions in the game, with a boot camp training mission also available. Some of the maps are directly based on those in <em>Army Men II</em>, others have been newly designed. Unlike in <em>Army Men II</em>, all missions take place in the \"real\" world, where the plastic toy soldiers find themselves in environments like (relative to their size) huge gardens, kitchens or garages.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is unchanged from the predecessor. Seen from a top-down perspective, players control only Sarge, without a support squad as seen in the PC game. Sarge can pick up various weapons like flamethrowers, mortars and grenades in addition to his standard gun with unlimited ammo, but can carry only three items total. It is again also possible to enter and use vehicles. An overview map of the level shows both Sarge's and the enemies' positions.</p>\n<p>The game introduces a two-player mode via link cable, with two game modes: deathmatch and capture-the-flag. As before, the game features voice samples and saving via passwords.</p>",

The available racing modes are single races and a 16-race season, with progress saved to battery-backed RAM. There is also a head-to-head two-player mode via link cable. Game options include selectable difficulty, numbers of car on the track (from 10 to 20), race length (in % of a real NASCAR race, default is 3% for 11 laps), car damage (off, on, or limited) and pit mode (for short or long races).</p>\n<p>Before a race, the selected car can be tuned from the defaults of which every driver has his own. Fuel volume, wheel lock, rear spoiler, shock absorbers, tire pressure and weight jacking are adjustable. During the race, the own car is seen from a third-person perspective, with race stats, damage and fuel indicators, speed and current gear displayed at the top and bottom. Only in the season mode there is a choice of automatic or manual shifting.</p>",

Less of a serious simulation of tennis than other versions, the handheld edition features cartoony 2D graphics and outrageous court locations.</p>\n<p>All-in-all, the game includes eight different players and twelve different tournaments. Only five players and four tournaments can be selected from the start, the others are unlocked by winning events. The starting tournaments are realistic grand slam events: the Roland Garros French Open (the only one with a license), the English Open (i.e. Wimbledon), the US Championship and the Australian Cup, on clay, grass or turf. Winning them unlocks the more unusual locations: from street and beach tournaments to far-out events in the Antarctic or on the moon.</p>\n<p>All events are single elimination, starting at the quarter finals. Matches follow original rules, and are seen from a standard perspective behind the controlled player. All characters (players, officials and fans) are drawn in a cartoony style with oversized heads. The controls allow for a variety of moves including backhand and forehand shots, volleys and lobs.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Heroes of Might and Magic</em> is a turn-based strategy game with a fantasy setting and the first appearance of the series on the Game Boy Color. In concept, rules and gameplay it is based closely on the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/668/heroes-of-might-and-magic/\">original PC game</a>, but has controls and graphics adapted to the handheld and comes with its own set of scenarios.</p>\n<p>As in the original game, players control one of four warlords and must defeat the other three to win a scenario. Heroes are the central units of the game and are used to explore the top-down map, gather treasure and resources, claim mines, find artifacts and fight battles against roaming creatures or enemy heroes. The player's castles are used to recruit new heroes and to produce units to both defend the castles and make up the heroes' armies. Castles can be upgraded by adding new buildings, allowing for different and more powerful units to be built. Battles take place on special tactical screens and allow attacker and defender to give movement and attacking orders to each group of units. Heroes can employ magic spells during battles, but otherwise don't take part in the fights directly. By gaining experience, heroes level up RPG-style, increasing the power of their armies in the process.</p>\n<p>The game does not include a campaign like the PC version, but instead comes with a selection of 31 freely selectable scenarios designed especially for the handheld. These are rated according to difficulty (6 easy, 17 medium, 8 hard) and map size. The opponent's intelligence and the amount of initial resources are customizable. Games can be saved to battery-backed RAM, for which three save slots are available.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Toy Story Racer</em> is a kart racing game based on the Toy Story films. Completely different from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6486/disneypixar-toy-story-racer/\">the PlayStation game of the same name</a>, the GBC version features circuit racing on ten tracks and employs 3D graphics through use of pre-rendered full motion video.</p>\n<p>The game includes two modes: a tournament and a quick race. Only three tracks are available from the start in quick race mode, the others have to be unlocked in the tournament. Players can select from four Toy Story characters: Buzz Lightyear, Woody, Bo Peep and Mr. Potato Head. The tracks are located in Andy's house, the Pizza Planet and the streets around the neighborhood.</p>\n<p>Races are against three competitors and are seen from a third-person view behind the player's kart. The tracks have been pre-rendered in (simple) 3D; hitting the gas begins playing the track video to give the illusion of the kart moving forward on the track. Turns are thus automatic, but steering is still necessary to not crash into the sides of the track and slow down. Various items can be found on the road, some with positive, some with negative effects. Positive ones include a horseshoe for invincibility and a tire for perfect grip. Negative ones are an anchor for a full stop, a snail for reduced speed and a steering wheel that switches left and right on the controls. There are also golden coins to pick up. These become necessary if a character is removed from the game by finishing in fourth place or not completing a lap within the time limit. With enough coins, removed characters can be bought back. If all four are removed, it's game over.</p>\n<p>Progress through the tournament is stored via passwords. The game has a high score table (deleted upon turning off), selectable difficulty and the choice of races consisting of 3 or 5 laps.</p>",

The player starts with one Robopon, and must travel Porombo Island as he/she collects Robopon and uses them to battle other Robopon collectors. The collectors primarily played against are known as the \"Legend 7\", who are the top-ranked collectors of Robopon on the island. When Cody beats a Legend 7 member, he takes their rank.</p>\n<p>To improve Robopon, they must be upgraded by adding software or other parts to them. Each part has a certain amount of space for storing software and will determine what attacks can be used by the Robopon. Software can be mixed to generate special attacks.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, <em>Robot Ponkottsu</em> plays a lot like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pok%C3%A9mon+series\">Pok\u00e9mon</a>. Fighting is turn based and is between two Robopon owners who tell their Robopon to issue attacks or go on the defensive. Robopon can be healed in mid-battle with spells (which can be bought in town shops or stumbled upon between towns) or taken to a Robopon dispatch center and healed in their machine. One thing where <em>Robot Ponkottsu</em> differs from <em>Pok\u00e9mon</em> is that in battle, a defeated Robopon sometimes will drop add-on items which get claimed by the winner. When a new game is started, the game asks for the player's birth date which is actually used by the game to select the first Robopon the player will start with. </p>\n<p><em>Star Version</em> was released alongside <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/64281/robopon-sun-version/\">Sun Version</a> and can connect to that version via infrared sensor. There are 153 different kinds of Robopon, and only by trading between versions can all of them be collected in one save.</p>",

Looking into the bottle, they find a message signed by Croc's mom, that says she is looking for him. Croc now begins his mission on a search for his long lost parents. Croc's mission won't be easy though as his greatest foe, the Baron Dante, has been brought back to life by his Dantini minions.</p>\n<p><em>Croc 2</em> is a top-down action game. Croc visits four different villages (Sailor, Cossack, Caveman, and Inca) where he is given various tasks to do by the Gobbos. Croc can jump, stomp, push crates, pick up and throw objects, and can perform tail-whips and tumble attacks when dealing with his enemies. Defeated enemies can drop heart refills or crystals.</p>\n<p>Speaking of crystals, throughout each village, Croc collects crystals that he can later spend at Swap Meet Pete's shop. Buying items from the shop such as Jump Jelly and Robo Gobbos will allow Croc to explore previously unreachable areas. Croc starts out with three hearts as his life meter, but this number can be increased by heart pots.</p>\n<p>The game also feature light puzzle solving elements. These mostly come in the form of hitting switches.</p>",

The Grinch devises a plan to put a stop to this noisy celebration by stealing the villages Christmas presents.</p>\n<p><em>The Grinch</em> is a <em>Pac-Man variant</em>. The game consists of seven scenes divided into several levels. Each level is viewed from a top-down perspective. The levels typically consist of a few screens of the village and also may contain houses which can be entered. In order to complete each level, the Grinch (or his dog Max in some scenes) must collect all the presents scattered around in a set amount of time. The time limit can be extended by finding timer icons. The levels are populated by the Who-Ville citizens who will chase the Grinch if he is spotted, so it's best that the Grinch try to remain as stealthy as possible while snatching presents.</p>\n<p>The Grinch only has a limited number of attacks he can perform to stun the villagers who chase him, thus leaving running away as his most used option when spotted by a villager, since a villager can only chase the Grinch for a short amount of time before tiring themselves out. In some levels, the Grinch will be driving a small car while doing his foul deeds. In the Max levels, Max has a jump that he can perform to jump over the dogs who spot him.</p>",

Thus, Bruce has enlisted a new protege, a teenager named Terry McGinnis, to take over his role as the Batman. </p>\n<p>Out one night, Terry gets word from Bruce that Gotham Air &amp; Space has had a break in, At the scene of the crime, Terry runs in to the Jokerz, the Joker's minions, who seem to be stealing high tech parts for some plan devised by the Joker. So now this new Batman must thwart the old Batman's nefarious enemy and disrupt whatever caper he has planned.</p>\n<p>The game consists of five levels of beat-'em up actions interspersed with cutscene dialogues throughout that advance the story. The levels feature the occasional branching path, which while leading to the same place, offer the player a chance to face enemies they wouldn't have seen if they kept to a linear path throughout.</p>\n<p>Batman can attack his foes with punches and kicks and occasionally use items he finds scattered throughout a level. This additional equipment, which either effects Batman's movement or attacks, includes Batwings, Magnetic Nunchakus, a Dark Knight discus, Boot Jets, a Dark Knight shield, and a Dark Knight staff.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Dale accidentally dropped his acorns into the Magical Kingdoms fireworks machine causing it to malfunction and explode into thirteen pieces that scattered all around the amusement park. So Chip and Dale decide to enlist their friends to help collect the pieces of the machine before nightfall hits. They decide that racing would be the quickest way to get the pieces, and since time is of the essence the pieces should go to the quickest of the friends. Of course, everyone wants to be the hero, so the races won't exactly be that friendly.</p>\n<p><em>Walt Disney World Quest: Magical Racing Tour</em> is side-scrolling kart racer. The selectable racers include Chip, Dale,Amanda Sparkle, Tiara Damage, Bruno Biggs, Moe Whiplash, Otto Plugnut Oliver Chickley III, Polly Roger, Baron Karlott, as well as Jiminy Cricket and two other characters who are unlockable after certain conditions are met.</p>\n<p>The regular race tracks include racing at Big Thunder Mountain, Blizzard Beach, Dinosaur (Disney's Animal Kingdom), Rock 'N' Roller Coaster, Haunted Mansion, Jungle Cruise, Tomorrowland Speedway, Space Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Splash Mountain The races consist of going around the track in three laps against three other opponents. On the track itself are coins that when collected increase the players speed and arrows on the ground called zippers which give the player a temporary burst of speed. There are also Mickey balloons that when ran over are popped and give the player an item which can either help the player or hinder their opponent. Items include acorns, guided bottle rockets, teacup mines, frog spell, turbo, and invincibility, There are also eight fairies on each race course to collect that involves the games unlockable content. Coming in first place earns the player a piece of the fireworks machine. </p>\n<p>These race courses can be raced three times each, Once for the machine piece, once for a 1st Place Pennant, and once again for a Trophy Challenge. While the first two are done as races with competitors, the Trophy Challenge just has the player by themselves trying to collect trophies in a limited amount of time.</p>\n<p>There are also three Disney Challenge courses where the player has to collect 30 coins before the time expires in order to earn a piece of the fireworks machine. The courses are Test Track (Epcot Center), Typhoon Lagoon, and Disney Studios.</p>\n<p>Besides the Adventure mode storyline there is also a Time Trial mode.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Qix Adventure</em> is a handheld entry in Taito's arcade game series. The main mode of the game is the treasure mode which is more story oriented than previous games in the series. The player controls a character called Speedy whose task is to collect treasure from various beasts.</p>\n<p>The gameplay works like previous games but with some differences. Like before a level is completed by capturing 75% of its area and two different enemies (sparx and qix) prevent the player from doing so. What's new is that the playfield also contains one beast and a chest which contains a treasure. The player can collect treasure by first capturing the beast which causes the chest to open and then capturing the object that is revealed. In this way it's possible to capture up to three pieces of treasure per level. There are also various items to collect that gives certain advantages when used.</p>\n<p>In addition to the treasure mode there is also a battle mode and a version of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Qix\">Qix</a> game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Pocket Soccer</em> is a, fast-paced simplified soccer/football game played with teams of five players and two substitutes. One action button is used for shooting, the other for passing the ball or tackling opponents. </p>\n<p>The following game modes are available: quick start (randomly picks two teams and a venue), exhibition (lets you chose your team, the opponent team and the venue), playoffs (lets you choose between 8, 16 and 32 teams) and league (where you need to get your team to the top and can trade players as you go). There are 12 fictive venues to choose from (gymnasium, street, beach, schoolyard...).</p>\n<p>Each player has their own statistics (stamina, skill, tackling, agility, accuracy, power, teamplay, speed and even IQ) that impact the team as a whole. Besides this, a lot of parameters can be customized, be it for teams for which you can change the name, color, composition and line up, or players for whom you can change the name, gender and facial features.</p>\n<p>Also available is a 2-player mode that requires two Game Boy Colors connected by a Game Link cable.</p>",

Once a track is unlocked, it can also be used for a time trial race.</p>\n<p>The races are shown in a pseudo-3D bird's eye view, with tunnels and signs sometimes obscuring the racers. A major gameplay element is picking up power-up icons: the turbo icon delivers a short speed burst, necessary for beating the competition. There is also a grip icon that temporarily improves handling. Oil slicks on the tracks should be avoided.</p>",

It reuses several of the original's modes and gameplay mechanics and adds one original mode, but has a smaller selection of cars, and a graphics engine adapted to the handheld platform.</p>\n<p>The game includes 12 cars (down from 22 in the console version) and 12 tracks. Only five cars are available from the start, the rest are unlocked by accumulating mileage. The tracks follow the same themes as those in the console version: from exotic locales (Korea, Ireland, Tibet) and cities (Hong Kong, Las Vegas) to far-out fantasy worlds (Atlantis, a prehistoric jungle, Mars). They have however been redesigned to fit the 2D engine, which uses an <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/16/outrun/\">OutRun</a>-style perspective view of the track, so there are none of the extravagant jumps and drops of the original. The engine offers three different viewing heights to choose from.</p>\n<p>The three game modes are Exotica, Freestyle and Circuit. Exotica is the main game mode, consisting of consecutive races on all of the game's tracks. Winning a race is necessary to advance to the next track. In Freestyle mode, all tracks can be accessed for a trial run from the start. Circuit mode is exclusive to the GBC version: it moves through various multi-track rounds, in which final placements determine a point score. Reaching a certain score threshold is necessary to advance to the next round.</p>\n<p>The game uses the same trick system as the console version: double-tapping the gas launches the car into a wheelie for a short speed burst. When hitting another car, moves like flips, spins and rolls can be launched through button combos, accelerating the car further.</p>",

The European release of the game has real player names, but the US release replaces them with fictional ones. The teams can be used in a variety of modes: friendlies, leagues and cups (of either 8, 16 or 32 teams and a choice of neutral stadiums or home/away factoring in) and a practice mode (for full games or penalties). Two special Ronaldo cups are also available: a three-on-one cup and a final four round.</p>\n<p>Options include game lengths of two, five or ten minutes, a choice of arcade and simulation mode and the optional golden goal rule for overtime. Before a match, strategy, formations and positions can be set. A match itself is seen from a bird's-eye view, with the field scrolling left to right. Controls allow for shots and passes (with the length of the button press determining the power), tackles and headers.</p>",

Only half of the characters are selectable from the start, the rest have to be unlocked by completing several of the game's modes. The races take place over nine tracks located all over the United States, from Alaska to Hawaii and from New York to Oregon.</p>\n<p>Four different game modes are available: Arcade mode consists of three different cups of three tracks each. Finishing among the top three is necessary to advance from one track to the next. Endurance mode takes place on shorter variations of the regular tracks. In this mode, the racer in last position gets eliminated after every checkpoint until only the winner remains. Winning a track is necessary to advance to the next. Championship mode goes trough all tracks in order, with points awarded depending on finishing position. Time Trial mode allows the practicing of every track and competing for the best times.</p>\n<p>The races are seen from a view behind the racer, with an <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/16/outrun/\">OutRun</a>-style perspective view of the track. Power-ups lie on the track and can be picked up to unleash a variety of effects. These include self-guided missiles (explosive and freezing) as well as temporary speed-ups and invincibility. The AI opponents use different power-ups that they drop into the player's way, including bombs, mines and oil slicks.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>LEGO Stunt Rally</em> for Game Boy Color is a simplified version of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4969/lego-stunt-rally/\">PC game of the same name</a>. While it features the same storyline and environments, the handheld version has platform-appropriate 2D graphics, different track design, and fewer gameplay options.</p>\n<p>As in the PC game, the goal in the game's main championship mode is to defeat Mr. X, the top racer of Stunt Island. To be able to compete against Mr. X, four other racers must be defeated first. The championship moves through four environments with five tracks each: city, desert, jungle and ice, followed by the final challenge against Mr. X. Races must be won in order to continue. The quick race mode sets up a race on a random track, while the single race mode can be used to play races on tracks unlocked in the championship.</p>\n<p>At the start of the game, four different cars are available, which more available for unlocking by winning races in championship mode. Unlike in the PC game, the cars cannot be customized for different track conditions with wheels or, for visual splendor only, with colors.</p>\n<p>Races are seen from a top-down view. Cars corner automatically, with the player only controlling acceleration and lane changes, with the gist of the game thus being slowing down enough before corners so the car isn't thrown off-track while still being fast enough to win. Sometimes, one of the two lanes is blocked, making switching necessary. While there are ramps and jumps in the game, the more extravagant elements of the PC version like jumping through smoke pillars or driving through loops are not present. Power-up pick-ups have also been reduced: the remaining ones are oil slicks, temporary speed-ups, invincibility and perfect grip.</p>\n<p>Like the PC version, the handheld version also features a track editor, with more than a dozen constructed tracks being able to be stored via battery backup. Playing through the championship mode unlocks new pieces to be used during construction.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Benjamin Bl\u00fcmchen: Ein verr\u00fcckter Tag im Zoo</em> (\"A Crazy Day at the Zoo\") is based on the long-running German children's audio play series starring talking elephant Benjamin Bl\u00fcmchen and his friends. In the game, Benjamin and his friend Otto are hired by newspaper reporter Karla Kolumna to take some photographs of the zoo animals for an article she's writing. This of course leads to all kinds of trouble for the two: they must navigate ice floats to get to the polar bear, take part in an animal race and must get back the camera when it's stolen (twice). Images in comic style illustrate the story between levels.</p>\n<p>The game consists of six action-filled levels, with most of them featuring a unique gameplay mechanic. Levels one and six feature Benjamin in a side-scrolling environment. He must avoid household objects come to life or various animals while searching for the stage exit. His health is measured in sugar cubes that get removed if an enemy touches him. He can find new cubes in the levels, but losing them all means restarting the current stage.</p>\n<p>Level two takes place underwater. Otto must swim through a cave system, avoiding dangerous plants and animals and periodically coming up for air. It's again Otto's turn in level three, which takes place on a large lake filled with water lily leaves, seen from a bird's eye view. Otto must jump from leaf to leaf to find the level exit. In level four, Benjamin finds himself in the house of zoo director Mr. Tierlieb and gets chased around by a mouse. Seen from a top-down perspective, it is the player's job to guide Benjamin through the house by not bumping into any furniture. Sugar cubes are again available to refill the elephant's health.</p>\n<p>Level five is the animal race, consisting of three rounds. Otto rides a zebra and must take on two other children riding a kangaroo and an ostrich. The races are seen from a top-down perspective and consist of several laps. Acceleration pads on the tracks can be ridden over for a short speed boost.</p>\n<p>Level progress is saved via passwords. It is always possible to play completed levels again, trying to get a better score by using less tries or by finishing in a better place in the race.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>NFL Blitz</em> for Game Boy Color is an adaptation of the football game of the same name released <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3126/nfl-blitz/\">on other platforms</a>. While it features the same style of arcade gameplay with loose rules, it has slightly different features and presents everything in platform-appropriate two-dimensional graphics.</p>\n<p>Among the deviations from standard NFL football are 30-yard-downs, seven-man teams, legal pass interference, the clock stopping after every play, and the absence of referees. Play modes include exhibition games and a full season with progress saved via password. Quarter length can be set between one and six minutes. Players can select from the 30 teams of the 1998 NFL season. Differences from other versions include different featured star players and the season not following any real-life schedule.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is seen from an isometric perspective. The playbook (same as in other versions) includes 18 offensive and 9 defensive plays, which are flippable. On offense, players can engage a turbo to run faster, and launch evasive moves like spins and hurdles while on defense, the controlled player is freely switchable and is capable of diving and tackling.</p>\n<p>The Game Boy Printer is supported for printing out stats and passwords.</p>",

Like the original game it carries a license to include professional beach volleyball players from the real sport. There are eleven teams in total, six men's teams and five women's teams. The game is played from a side view perspective that scrolls from side to side. The control pad is used for moving around, the A button is used to bump, set, spike and throw the ball while the B is used to jump and block shots.</p>\n<p>There are three game modes: single match, championship and versus game. The single match mode is for practising playing the game with any of the included teams. In the tournament mode the player enters competitions that are gradually unlocked. By winning tournaments the player can also unlock secret modes and a hidden court. The versus game is for two player multiplayer matches that are played over a link cable.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Nintama Rantar\u014d: Ninjutsu Gakuen ni Ny\u016bgaku Shiy\u014d no Dan is based on the anime Nintama Rantar\u014d. The game is a collection of 6 minigames. Five of these minigames can be accessed through the Shugy\u014d no Maki (\u4fee\u884c\u306e\u5dfb) option. You can select one of three players for each minigame: Rantar\u014d (\u4e71\u592a\u90ce), KiriMaru (\u304d\u308a\u4e38), and ShinB\u0113 (\u3057\u3093\u30d9\u30a8).</p>\n<p>The first game in this mode is Ch\u014dhitsu (\u8df3\u98db\u8853), where you must wall jump up 15 meters and reach the goal as fast as possible within 60 seconds. The second game is H\u014djutsu (\u7832\u8853), where you must shoot as many targets as possible within 30 seconds. The third game is Shuriken (\u624b\u88cf\u5263\u8853). This plays similar to H\u014djutsu, where you must hit as many targets as possible within 30 seconds. However, the targets move up and down, and you can no longer move your character, and must move the D-pad left or right to aim, as well as pressing up to hit certain targets. The fourth game is Ashikogijutsu (\u8db3\u6f15\u304e\u8853), where you must row 30 meters to the goal as fast as possible within 60 seconds. The last minigame in Shugy\u014d no Maki is Eijutsu (\u6cf3\u8853). This is similar to Ashikogijutsu; you must swim 30 meters to the goal as fast as possible in 60 seconds. However, you now have a breath meter, which means you must stop paddling when it gets to low and get your breath meter back up.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is Taisen no Maki (\u5bfe\u6226\u306e\u5dfb). In this game, you and your opponent aim to collect all 5 scrolls on the map. If you don't have all the scrolls because your opponent has the rest, you must attack them using one of three weapons; shurikens, spikes, and bombs. These can be picked up on the map and are generated randomly. Once you have all 5 scrolls, you must try to avoid the opponent until the 3-minute timer expires. Whoever has the most scrolls wins the game.\nYou play against two students (who the two students are depends on which character you choose), before finally going up against the teachers Doi and Yamada.</p>\n<p>The game offers two-player support in Taisen no Maki, and features the option Kiroku no Maki (\u8a18\u9332\u306e\u5dfb), which allows the player to look at the high scores attained in the 5 Shugy\u014d no Maki minigames.</p>",

The main draw is the Story Mode, where players select between a boy or girl as their character and play through a total of five levels of increasing difficulty against animated CPU opponents represented by animals. Before each match, players are asked a series of trivia questions pertaining to Othello, and some strategy questions where they are asked to choose the best move for a given board state; getting these questions right is not necessary to advance the game. They can also skip this mode entirely and just play a single game, selecting between 4 CPU opponents or choosing to play against Guest, which lets them play a two-player game (by handing off the game to a second player between moves).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Woody Woodpecker Racing</em> is a kart racing game featuring characters from the popular series of cartoons starring Woody Woodpecker. Unlike the associated game for 3D Platforms, the racing is depicted in a top-down 2D view. Gameplay remains heavily modeled on <em>Mario Kart</em>, as the the player races around a track with the usual array of speed boosts, jump ramps, water hazards, and cliffs. Riding over star blocks rewards the player with a random assortment of power-ups and weapons: jump springs, nitro boosts, rockets, oil slicks, invincibility charges, etc. The game begins with six of the ten racers (including Woody and Winnie Woodpecker) unlocked; the rest may be obtained by winning tournaments. A two-player head-to-head racing mode is also supported via the link cable.</p>\n<p>There are two tournament modes: Extreme and Grand Prix, each consisting of the same series of twelve three-track tournaments (spread across sixteen distinct racetracks). In Extreme, the player must finish in a minimum qualifying position to advance, resulting in a smaller field of challengers as the tournament goes on; Grand Prix adds some additional challenge by keeping the whole field of competitors throughout and ranking racers with points for their finishing positions. Earning gold trophies in tournaments unlocks points used to equip better car parts for future races across all modes.</p>\n<p>All tracks are also available in two practice modes, Sprint and Time Trial. Sprint is a single tournament-style race against a full field of AI racers. Time Trial is a traditional run of an empty track with power-ups disabled; a \"ghost car\" of the player's best trial time may be enabled for reference.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>SWIV</em> on the Game Boy Color is an adaptation of the 1992 SNES version Super SWIV (aka Firepower 2000 in North America). It's a vertical scrolling shooter where the player may choose to pilot a chopper or to drive an attack Jeep. The chopper is not blocked by obstacle, but can only fire straight forward. Unlike the SNES/Genesis version, Jeep and Chopper have same specs: same speed, same armor, same agility. Levels are also 'inspired' by the 1992 version but modified (less long, less enemies). The 2 players mode (one controlling the chopper, the other in the jeep) was also removed.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Power Pro-kun Pocket</em> is a 1999 arcade Baseball simulator developed by Diamond Head and published by Konami for the Game Boy Color. It was designed as a spinoff of <em>Jikkyou Pawafuru Puroyaky\u016b 5</em>, and is set apart by its darker storytelling with slight fantasy elements.</p>\n<p>The game's main feature is its \"Success\" story scenario, \"Extreme High School Edition\", which follows a student who transfers to a very decrepit school and must convince his classmates to join his Baseball team after the club collapses on top of the former corrupt staff. The player must manage the protagonist's weekly routine to train, meet new teammates and date one out of a few love interests. Failing to keep the protagonist healthy, being unable to keep the Baseball club running or losing a late-game match results in a game over which erases the player's save file. One can reset the game to prevent a game over, but there are restrictions and penalties for doing so.</p>\n<p>Upon clearing the Success mode with any ending, the player can use the resulting character to build a custom team for playing Baseball on the Exhibition mode. Matches between two people who own the game and a link cable are supported.</p>\n<p>In 2004, a compilation remake of this game and its sequel was released for the Game Boy Advance.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Bob the Builder: Fix it Fun!</em> is a game based on the British television series of the same name. Bob and Wendy are having a big picnic, but there is a lot of work to do beforehand. Each of Bob's friends has work to get done. Roley must flatten the road in time for the picnic. Lofty must save ducklings before they run off-stream. Dizzy must help Spud collect all the apples for the picnic. Muck must help Farmer Pickles fix his wall.</p>\n<p>Not only do the machines have to do jobs, Bob and his other colleagues have work to do. Bob must find tiles that blew off of the Town Hall roof, music sheets that blew off the bandstand, packages that Spud stole, and pieces to mend the fence. Bob must also feed Pilchard, the pet cat. All of Bob's tasks are platformer mini-games, with many different areas to explore and a key to unlock an area. These sections are based on health-based rather than time-based. Once all the tasks are compete, you must play as Scoop and collect all the things for the picnic. There are three difficulties; easy. medium, and hard, which change the difficulty of the mini-games (less time, objects are more hidden, etc.)</p>",

There are three tracks to choose from at the start; four additional tracks can be unlocked by finding keys throughout the races. There are many different robots to choose from, each with different stats. Each race is three laps long, and there are many items that can affect your race. Blue pickups let you boost while red pickups stop you in your tracks. After completing the three original tracks in first place, you fight a boss, Holossal. You do this by defeating him in a versus race. There are also shortcuts along the way.</p>",

Along the way, Doug meets many familiar faces, including his parents, his sister Judy, and his friends like Skeeter, Beebe, and Chalky. They will give you clues as to where Patti may be. Doug also has Quailman segments, where Doug imagines that he is a superhero by the name of Quailman, and must do certain things like defeat a boss or clear a path. Each time you do this, you get a password. Do this enough times to eventually find Patti and win the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Dragon Tales: Dragon Wings</em> is a game based on the animated series Dragon Tales. At the start, you get to choose between two dragons; Org and Cassie, and also pick your difficulty. Your main goal, as a dragon, is to take lessons for flight, each with a specific goal. Each lesson has a set amount of missions to complete. Some are as simple as flying to a specific spot, while others are more elaborate and have multiple steps. Berries can also be collected to make new records. These missions are also timed, giving the player more of an incentive to play the lessons again to achieve the high score. Other missions have you pick up objects and move them to a certain place. There are 15 lessons in total, and some need to be unlocked by completing other lessons. A sliver trophy is given for a completion, and a golden trophy is given for a 100% completion.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Power Pro-kun Pocket 2</em> is a 2000 arcade Baseball simulator developed by Diamond Head and published by Konami for the Game Boy Color. The simple simulator works the same as it did in the first game, but now 12 teams of the Japanese league are available for free play.</p>\n<p>The game's main feature is its Success story scenario, \"Drill Moglars Edition\", which follows a new protagonist: a professional ballplayer who's been drafted into the Moglars, a small-time team owned by the Drill corporation. With the team already facing the threat of dissolution from severe mismanagement and outstanding debts, the protagonist must strive to lead them to the top of the Japanese league. Unlike how most <em>Jikkyou Pawafuru Puroyaky\u016b</em> games feature a negative continuity with the same cast of characters always at the same age, <em>Pawapoke 2</em> starts to expand the setting from <em>Pawapuro 5</em> across a storyline that spans over 30 years.</p>\n<p>The player must manage the protagonist's weekly routine to train, meet new teammates and date one out of a few love interests. Failing to keep the protagonist healthy, losing too much reputation or losing any late-game matches once again results in a game over which erases the player's save file. It is possible to reset the game to prevent that, but there are restrictions and penalties for doing so.</p>\n<p>Clearing the Drill Moglars scenario enough times reveals \"War\", the \"Inner Success\" scenario. This new story sees the protagonist exploring warzones during World War II. Its highlight is the <em>Minesweeper</em> gameplay with unusual rules: the player must guide the protagonist to the top of each board while looking out for mines and collecting items with unknown effects.</p>\n<p>Upon clearing either Success mode, the player can use the resulting character to build a custom team for playing Baseball on the Exhibition mode. Matches between two people who own the game and a link cable are supported. Characters can also be swapped between players, and they'll keep certain attributes that are needed to unlock the harem ending for Drill Moglars and the truth behind the War scenario.</p>\n<p>In 2004, a compilation remake of this game and its prequel was released for the Game Boy Advance.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Survival Kids 2: Dasshutsu!! Futago-Jima!</em> is the Japan-exclusive sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy-color/survival-kids\"><em>Survival Kids</em></a>.</p>\n<p>In this game, the player is offered to choose between two playable characters who are brothers. The brothers were planning to go camping when suddenly, a group of treasure hunters have stolen their grandfather's treasure map and kidnapped the boys. Depending on the choice in the beginning of the game, players may start the game imprisoned or on the shore of one of the seemingly deserted Twin Islands.</p>\n<p>In a similar manner to the previous game, <em>Survival Kids 2</em> is an Action RPG game where players need to survive by getting enough rest and regularly eating and drinking. Certain food such as mushrooms can have varying effects on the character including paralyzing or poisoning him, while other food can go rotten and make the protagonist sick if they eat it. Some food also requires cooking to be actually useful to the protagonist. The sequel also adds an extra character: a talking parrot, which can be used to assist players in different situations, as well as offer hints, provided that players give him food.</p>\n<p>The game also features a crafting system, which allows players to create a number of different items by combining two or three items. Plenty of useless items can also be made and found in addition to the ones essential to complete the game so players may need to think as to what they should take with them or throw away.</p>\n<p>There are 6 endings in total with slight variations of each of them, depending on whether the player had rescued the protagonist's brother or not.</p>",

The goal is for players to help K\u00e4pt'n Blaub\u00e4r walk over a set amount of star tiles per level and then make it to a life preserver tile to finish the level. The tricky part comes as when K\u00e4pt'n Blaub\u00e4r walks over a star tile it instantly converts to a pool of water which will cost K\u00e4pt'n Blaub\u00e4r his life if he enters it. So players have to contemplate on how to move K\u00e4pt'n Blaub\u00e4r or else they can unwittingly cut of his path and trap him in an unwinnable situation. The game worlds also have some other types of tiles to contend with like conveyor belts and wood tiles that crack and will cost K\u00e4pt'n Blaub\u00e4r his life if he stands on them for too long.</p>\n<p>The game consists of 6 worlds made up of 15 levels each for a total of 90 puzzles to solve. In between worlds there is a small mini-game in which K\u00e4pt'n Blaub\u00e4r pilots a submarine and has to avoid crashing into ocean life and also has to collect air bubbles so the subs oxygen doesn't deplete.</p>",

After a pizza delivery to a jail goes awry, the criminal Brickster escapes, and since Pepper is responsible for this predicament, he must set things right and send Brickster back to the hoosegow.</p>\n<p>The game is meant for children so gameplay is kept relatively simple. Pepper travels around Lego Islands on his skateboard. However parts of the island are inaccessible until Pepper delivers a particular item to the person who is blocking his path. Delivering the item is how the narrative of the story progresses. Also, finding hidden Lego character cards is the games reward for observant exploration of the island. The game contains dozens of cards to collect.</p>\n<p>Although Pepper can't be killed, he will have to deal with enemies by either bumping into them or stunning them with a pizza throw.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Cyborg Kuro-chan: Devil Fukkatsu!!</em> is a 2D rail shooter based on the <em>Cyborg Kuro-chan</em> manga and anime series. Players take control of the titular cat Kuro, a formerly normal housecat who survives being turned into a cyborg and sets out to take revenge on the mad scientist who did it to him with the help of his new cyborg weaponry. The 2D sidescrolling levels scroll automatically. Instead of controlling Kuro, players use the d-pad to control a crosshair to aim and shoot. With his array of cyborg weaponry, players can shoot down enemies and blow up the scenery. In addition, players can use the B button to make Kuro jump in order to dodge obstacles. At the beginning of every level, players can customize Kuro's weapon loadout; as the game progresses, players gain access to new guns they can equip. During levels, players can use the select button to toggle between all equipped weapons.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Cyborg Kuro-chan 2: White Woods no Gyakush\u016b</em>  is a 2D rail shooter based on the <em>Cyborg Kuro-chan</em> manga and anime series. Players take control of the titular cat Kuro, a formerly normal housecat who survives being turned into a cyborg and sets out to take revenge on the mad scientist who did it to him with the help of his new cyborg weaponry. This entry plays exactly the same as the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/142306/cyborg-kuro-chan-devil-fukkatsu/\">previous game</a>. The 2D sidescrolling levels scroll automatically. Instead of controlling Kuro, players use the d-pad to control a crosshair to aim and shoot. With his array of cyborg weaponry, players can shoot down enemies and blow up the scenery. In addition, players can use the B button to make Kuro jump in order to dodge obstacles. At the beginning of every level, players can customize Kuro's weapon loadout; as the game progresses, players gain access to new guns they can equip. During levels, players can use the select button to toggle between all equipped weapons.</p>",

Players guide the small boy Kirikou through nine levels as he sets out to confront Karaba the sorceress and free the village warriors. Kirikou explores the environments, attacks opponents with a knife and collects objects. Levels have a lot of verticality and platforms are connected through ladders. Each level has a set amount of objects to collect, also shown in the HUD, but levels can be completed by reaching the exit as collecting them is not a requirement to progress. After each level a password is provided.</p>",

Based on the <em>Sesame Street</em> movie <em>Elmo in Grouchland</em>, the game takes the player, or Elmo, through six normal platformer levels and two unique platformers. While one involves the descent into Grouchland, the other involves riding a mine cart. This game takes the player from Sesame Street to Huxley's House. The player can play with or without sound effects, with or without music, and in easy or hard mode.</p>\n<p>When starting the game, the player starts with three lives. He/she can gain many extra lives throughout the game. If all lives are lost, the player can either choose to continue with three more lives or choose to go straight to the Game Over screen and credits. After the player loses all lives three times, chooses to end the game, or completes all eight stages, the game is concluded.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>No Fear Downhill Mountain Biking</em> is a 2D side-scrolling mountain bike racing game carrying the US No Fear lifestyle clothing brand. Players can choose between different racers with four main statistics: balance, power, recovery and stamina. There is a bike setup for every track based on the conditions, covering the tyres, gear ratio, brakes, suspension, frame and wheels.</p>\n<p>Races are often done head-to-head where opponents can be hindered. There are obstacles to avoid and a track to navigate. Peddling at the highest rate all the time is not possible because there is a stamina meter involved, so speed needs to be built up carefully with moments of recovery.</p>\n<p>The game mode are Championship (with three difficulty levels: Amateur, Pro and Elite), Single Race, Time Trial, Tournament, Duel and Trick Track. The game keeps track of the highest scores.</p>",

The player takes control of an unnamed character and chooses various casino games by walking the player character around the casino. There are up to eight games: Blackjack, Mini Baccarat, Roulette, Poker Challenge, Video Poker, Slot Machines, Video Keno, and Big 6. Poker Challenge, Video Poker, and Slot Machines all have a few different variations that can be played.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to accumulate enough money to gain entry into the High Roller rooms. However, the game has no ending, and the player can play and accumulate as much money as they desire. The player can also visit the banker to take out or repay loans.</p>\n<p>The game introduces new mechanics to its Game Boy predecessor. The most notable functions are the Bet Unit and Speed Bet options. The Bet Unit presents the player with several values of chips that the player can use to increase (with the A button) and decrease (with the B button) their bets. However, the player must bet within the table limits. Speed Bet allows the player to automatically bet the same amount of money as they previously did and start a game immediately.</p>\n<p>Other features allow the player to load and save their progress, edit their name, and view statistics.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Based off the BBC children's television series <em>The Tweenies</em>, this game, which can be played in English, Italian, Dutch, or Spanish, has the player complete minigames to help Doodles the dog find his bones in easy, medium, or hard mode. Before he could dig them out of the ground, he must collect eight missing pieces of the garden map. To obtain each piece of the map, the player must play the first said amount of minigames in any order, each awarding the player with one piece if success happens. Four involve meeting one of the Tweenies in the garden; the other four involve going to the Tweenie Clock inside the playroom to choose a game. Upon going in front of the clock or character and selecting it/him/her, the player gets the choice of accepting or rejecting a chance of playing the minigame. Selecting the right arrow towards the top of the screen means accepting a challenge; selecting the left one, which is also towards the top, means the opposite.</p>\n<p>At the Tweenie Clock, if the player chooses the right arrow, the clock will go through the clockwise space selection slowly enough for the player to select which game to play. There are five spaces; four of those spaces can be landed on, while the \"News Time\" space (the orange one resembling the show's iconic six-circle icon) corresponds to the ninth and very last minigame to play. The player has eight misses before failing for easy mode, seven for medium, and six for hard.</p>\n<p>In \"Telly Time\" (when the green space with the television is selected), the player, as Milo, must match the item show below the television with the items scrolling through the TV screen The items scroll faster as the difficulty rises. In \"Messy Time\" (when the blue space with the splotch is selected), the player plays Jake, who must drop pieces of clay into moving buckets with matching colors. The buckets scroll faster with higher difficulty. \"Story Time\" (when the red space with the book is selected) has the player, or Fizz, place items into illustrations corresponding to their stories. Different stories are portrayed for each difficulty. During \"Song Time\" (when the yellow space with eighth notes is selected), the player, as Bella, must correctly repeat certain patterns played first by the game itself. Patterns overall become more complicated for each higher difficulty.</p>\n<p>The garden minigames are side-scrolling ones, which involve collecting eight items; collecting stars in those minigames mean filling the endurance bar completely again. The endurance bar always lowers for every hit or attack that happens; for hard, it also lowers due to extended time spent in a minigame. More enemies and more complex versions of tasks are included in harder difficulties. When selecting Milo, the player can play as him in another minigame; he is a clown under a circus tent, and he must find all skittles to win. The player, upon selecting Jake (or as he likes to be known, Dotman), must collect all blue shells underwater. When playing as Fizz, the player must bloom all plants in the castle to win. In the forest as Bella, the player must collect all bananas in the jungle.</p>\n<p>After all eight minigames are successfully done, all the map pieces have been retrieved. Now, the player must go back to the Tweenie Clock to choose \"News Time,\" which allows to play the last minigame. The player, as Doodles, must dig up all of the missing bones in the garden. After the player succeeds, he/she wins.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Jagainu-kun</em> is a rhythm game based on the anime of the same name.</p>\n<p>The story of the game is that Jagainu-kun and Haripoteto-chan are walking through the forest one day, and come across Nasuinu-kun spinning around. Nasuinu-kun is preparing for a dance party. Haripoteto-chan decides to go to the dance party, and the three of them head to the dance party. However, Jagainu-kun had never danced before, but decides to go, thinking he can learn to dance while he's there.</p>\n<p>In the game, the opponent (or dance partner) demonstrates a set of moves that must be copied by the player, Jagainu-kun. You are judged on how well you copied the opponent's dance moves, indicated by a weather mark. The sunnier the weather, the better your performance is. The goal of each stage is to beat each one with sunny weather. Beating each stage with sunny weather not only unlocks more songs, but also more friends, who are added to your \"Friend Files\" (\u30c8\u30e2\u30c0\u30c1\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb). \"Friend Files\" will give a brief description of each character unlocked. They can also be unlocked by different means, such as using the Communication Exchange mode.</p>\n<p>Here are the main modes of play:</p>\n<p>Story Mode (\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9): Jagainu-kun (controlled by the player) must compete in several dances against several characters. Clearing this mode 100% will unlock a new mode; Communication Battle, in which the player can compete with a human opponent (see below).</p>\n<p>Picture Book (\u3048\u307b\u3093): The cutscenes in the Story Mode are changed into a picture book that the player can view. There are four of them that can be unlocked by clearing all stages in the Story Mode, including the hidden stages. However, they differ depending on how the player plays through the Story Mode.</p>\n<p>Communication Exchange (\u3064\u3046\u3057\u3093\u3053\u3046\u304b\u3093): This mode allows you to 'trade' characters with another human player via the link cable. However, the player will still get to keep the character(s) that they trade away.</p>\n<p>Communication Battle (\u3064\u3046\u3057\u3093\u305f\u3044\u305b\u3093): This mode allows you to compete in a dance with another human player via the link cable. Player 1 is Jagainu-kun while Player 2 is Haripoteto-chan. However, this mode must be unlocked first by unlocking all songs. The player with the highest score wins the game.</p>",

After every eight shots, the gun must be reloaded. Birds that are farther away gain more points while shooting down balloons or planes deducts points. The game contains three different landscapes (compared to just one in the original) and also introduces bonus items. These items are carried by some birds and are activated when shot. They include weapons like a machine gun or a gun with a wide spread as well as time bonuses.</p>\n<p>The game can be played for high score (a high score table is available) and in a tournament mode, which challenges the player with a higher score to reach in each subsequent stage.</p>",

The following games are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10-pin bowling</li>\n<li>Music rhythm</li>\n<li>Dance floor</li>\n<li>Ramen matches</li>\n<li>Crane game</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Winning the games with highest scores grants the player boosts for the group members in the form of cards. During the showdown against the final three bosses, the player can use the collected cards to make the mini-games easier. The final three mini-games are a Space Invaders-styled shooter, a turn-based strategy battle, and a card battle.</p>",
