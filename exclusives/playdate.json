        "description": "<p><em>Whitewater Wipeout</em> is an arcade-style surfing game controlled entirely with the Playdate's crank. The player uses the crank to control the surfer's direction and perform tricks when jumping from the top of the wave. Performing 360s before landing back on the wave will score the player points. If the player lands a trick incorrectly, falls from the bottom of the wave, or gets caught by the breaker coming from the right, the player loses one of their lives. After the player loses all 3 of their lives, the game is over and their score is logged in the high score table.</p>",

At the start of the game the player has access to 4 plots on the roof where they can plant some flowers. The flowers grow in real time, even when the game is not running. Once a flower is fully grown, the player can dig it up, which instantly sells the flower for a profit. During the game the player will interact with various characters via text messages on her phone, such as her girlfriend Ai. The player has access to various other features via their phone, such as the ability to buy seeds, see the current and upcoming weather, and collect an assortment of gachapon trinkets. When the player has accumulated enough money, they can use it to pay their rent, which gives them access to additional plots and increases the amount of profit they make from each flower. The game also includes an Asteroids-style minigame called Starshooter Hoshiko, which they can play during their downtime.</p>",

In the game, the player must match 3 or more items together to box them up and then ship them off to remove them from the playfield. Boxed items aren't removed automatically, so the player can make multiple matches and then ship them off all at once for bonus points. The game features multiple game modes that the player can play. Story mode, where the player follows Pup's story as they play through 30 levels with varying objectives. Infinity mode, an endless mode where the goal is to score as high as possible while the cost of penalties steadily increases. Chill mode, where the player can match without any penalties or end and see how many matches they can make at once. Danger Zone, where the player must clear bombs before they explode. And finally Time Attack, where the player has 2 minutes to score as many points as possible.</p>",

Like many games of this style, the player moves around the overworld walking up to enemies and attacking them with a sword. However the player also has a dodge button which they can use to avoid damage and open up bosses to attack. The players health can be regenerated by standing still in the overworld while not under attack. Defeating enemies will gain the player experience which can increase their attack and defence. The player can also increase their maximum health by finding fruit and gain abilities required to progress from statues.</p>",

The player uses the elevator to pick up penguins and deliver them to their desired floor, scoring points and keeping the timer that's counting down at bay. The penguins are impatient and if the player takes to long they will leave. As the player scores points, additional floors are added to the building. When the timer reaches zero the game is over. If the player scores enough they unlock additional levels which feature new gimmicks, such as a dual elevator shaft in level 2.</p>",

In each level, a number of boxes need to be moved to their target locations. The player can only push boxes to empty tiles, and can not move through walls. When stuck, players can use the Playdate's crank to quickly undo and redo moves. Levels get progressively more challenging, typically by increasing the amount of boxes on the board, and/or requiring more pushes to get each box to their target location.</p>\n<p>Additional playable characters are unlocked as the player solves more levels, though these are merely cosmetic rewards and do not affect the gameplay itself.</p>",

On your way to the sea, your boat is struck by an unknown sea monster. Your new goal is to go deeper into the sea, and find that creature at any cost.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is similar in style to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/63158/ridiculous-fishing/\">Ridiculous Fishing</a>, but with the twist that you can only catch a certain number of fish before your line snaps and you lose them all. Gameplay can quickly turn from hunting to avoiding. Once the fish are caught, you'll be harpooning them out of the sky, keeping the profits from whichever ones you can hit. Then you can take these profits to the local shopkeeper to purchase upgrades to take you deeper into the sea.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Down the Oubliette</em> is a tower defense game where a girl plunges deeper and deeper into the haunted floors beneath a country house. Floors are randomized each run and the player must dig through dirt to uncover the spirit spawners, after which the ghosts will chase the player and the placed towers must be used to wear them down. The player can only see so much of the floor with the ambient light that follows them, but a radar helps them figure out which dirt may contain spirit spawners.</p>\n<p>There are sixteen floors to a run with each thematic level consisting of four floors. Players can place four towers using the energy earned after clearing a wave of spirits, the beacon gradually wearing down ghosts with light, the coil zapping them with electricity, the fan holding them back a bit, and the torch emitting a stream of fire. Certain spirits are weak to specific tower types and towers can be upgraded to increase their effectiveness with crates found in certain stages.</p>\n<p>The player can restart failed floors with impunity but will have to try again if they lose all of their character's hearts. Hearts replenish between floors and the tower-building energy is carried between them,  and since players dig away the dirt to open up walkable areas, they can somewhat customize the path spirits will take when trying to reach their character.</p>",
