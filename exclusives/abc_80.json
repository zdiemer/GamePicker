The player starts with 100 points and loses a point for each time they fire. Large amounts of points are gained for hitting and destroying enemy ships. Large amounts of points are lost when getting hit by their bombs or nuclear charges. </li>\n<li><em>Othello</em> is a computer implementation of the classic game in which players take turns putting their tokens on the board and flipping any enclosed markers to their color.
