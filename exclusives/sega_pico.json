        "description": "<p><em>Pepe's Puzzles</em> is a puzzle game created for small children between the ages of 5-7 years old. There are three different kinds of mini-games found in this game; Mazes, Puzzles, and Sequential Memory/Matching Games. There are 5 different mazes to choose from, all with their own gimmicks. The main goal in the maze mini-games is to get to the flag, but each mini-game involves a different way to do so. One is simple movement, one is following arrows, one is a specifically colored path, one involves picking up all the fish food before reaching the flag, and one has X or O spaces on the maze. There are two different puzzles to choose from; a slide puzzle and a jigsaw puzzle. There are bad penguins that should be avoided in both puzzles. There are 4 different matching/memory games to choose from. One is simply matching fish, one is remembering the correct pathways by color, one has you turn the pages of the book to find an object, and one has you match the colored shapes in order. There are 2-3 difficulty levels depending on the mini-game, and it primarily focuses on teaching problem-solving and logic skills.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>LEGO Fun to Build</em> is an edutainment game for young children based on the popular construction toy. There are four main levels, each one based on one of LEGO's most popular themes at the time (Town, Aquazone, Castle, and Space), plus an additional sandbox level where the player can build their own creations.</p>\n<p>Each level contains a selection of building challenges that lead into mini-games. In the building challenges, the player is shown a themed model being disassembled and must rebuild the model in the order that it was disassembled in. The player is awarded a score counted in seconds based on how long they took to complete the model.</p>\n<p>In the Town level, building the boat, buggy, helicopter, or race car will load a racing mini-game where the player can choose to play as any of those vehicles in a race against the others. Winning the race will lead to a second race against the runner-up. Building the pizza van will load a mini-game where the player must deliver pizzas to houses within a time limit.</p>\n<p>In the Aquazone level, building the mini-submarine will load a side-scrolling action mini-game where the player must collect as many crystals as possible from the ocean floor within a time limit. Building the large submarine loads a first-person, claw machine-like mini-game where the player must collect crystals with a claw while avoiding a patrolling shark.</p>\n<p>In the Castle level mini-game, an evil wizard has possessed four knights by replacing their helmets with wizards' hats. The player explores the wizard's castle from a side perspective, choosing which paths to take while avoiding traps. While some traps can be overcome by solving puzzles, others force the player to take alternate routes. Eventually, the player must free the knights from the wizard's brainwashing by throwing helmets onto their heads while avoiding the wizard and his dragon.</p>\n<p>In the Space level, building a red saucer loads a mini-game where the player must search their immediate vicinity in space to find all of the pieces of a giant disassembled robot. Meanwhile, building a moon sled in the building challenge loads an ice hockey-esque mini-game where each goal scores awards the player with a part of a giant robot.</p>",
