The player is tasked with shooting Klingons in a 64 quadrant large galaxy. Each quadrant is divided into 64 sectors. The player can use scanners (short and long range) to find the enemy and then engage them with phasers and photon torpedoes. Moving around the galaxy costs energy which can be replenished at star bases.</p>",
