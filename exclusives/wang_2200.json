        "description": "<p><em>Martian War</em> is an action game in which the player is tasked to kill invading Martians. According to the game's story the year is 1987 and Ronald Reagan is about to end his second term. The world is a mess and only the player is available to fight the invading Martians. Gameplay consists of moving the player's weapon left and right along the bottom of the screen and firing at invading Martians before they can destroy all of humanity. The player can also be hit which causes some down-time during which the gun is repaired. If all Martians are shot the player wins.</p>",
