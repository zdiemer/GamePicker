Next to taps, there are also arrows where the player needs to shake the device left, right or down, using the accelerometer function. Not missing any notes provides a score multiplier of two, three, four and eventually eight times the basic points (called the Revenge mode).</p>\n<p>There are four difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard and extreme). At the end of each song, the score, accuracy and longest streak are shown. The score can also be registered online and regularly there are contests held on the official site. New songs are offered on a regular basis. Multiplayer is available for two players simultaneously on a single device, having each player tap a part of the screen with the two sections blending in the middle. In this mode, no shaking is used, only tapping.</p>",

There are four difficulty levels, with a different playlist and a special track at the end. When players do well in the regular tracks (based on accuracy), they are unlocked and offer new themes. These special levels were designed by the independent developers <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/309373/kevin-coulton/\">Kevin Coulton</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/297138/jonatan-soderstrom/\">Jonatan \"cactus\" S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m</a>.

New to the series is a Kids mode where the game cannot be lost and where feedback is given instantly based on the accuracy. Levels need to be completed one by one.

The basic premise of tapping and shaking the screen to match the music's rhythm has remained, but with slight modifications to the gameplay. It is now easier to reach the Revenge mode. New difficulty levels need to be unlocked and the general themes have been adapted to the band. The multiplayer function for two players using the device simultaneously is also available.</p>",

Only this time the player does not control a jeep in a full 3D environment, but a Chinook helicopter in 2D side-scrolling gameplay. Apart from that, the basic concept of the game is the same; raptors can be caught using a spiked ball dangling from the helicopter and points are earned when the meat is transported.

Players must answer the questions correctly to continue through all three difficulty rounds in the pursuit of earning points. There are also Bonus Lightning Questions in each category which increase bonus multipliers and keep the player's points safe.</p>\n<p>If successful in keeping Cheex the Monkey from falling off the vine, players can bank their points or use them to have Cheex steal items of Ben Stein's personal \"stuff\" using a parody of the App Store. Once the player has stolen all of Ben's stuff (which can take upwards of 150 rounds of trivia), they have successfully beat Ben Stein!</p>",

This version includes most of the enhancements the PC version has compared to the original prototype <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/28773/crayon-physics/\">Crayon Physics</a>, including a level editor. Only three levels can be saved however and they cannot be shared with other users.</p>\n<p>Instead of the islands with different level paths, this version has a strict level progression with 50 different levels (less than the original game). The goal for each of the levels is to move a red ball so it hits one or more stars. Players use their finger to draw physical objects of different colours which can move the ball, block it or provide a bridge. The objects interact with each other as well as with the environment. Objects can also be erased. When the ball falls off the screen, it reappears at its original relocation. It is also possible to reset an entire level by shaking the device.</p>\n<p>The game is played against a scrap paper background and all objects have a crayon art style. By pinching on the screen, it is possible to zoom in on the game elements. Scrolling is done by dragging the screen with two fingers.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Trism</em> is a puzzle game designed around the iPhone's ability to touch the screen and tilt it. The screen is filled with a board of triangles (or 'Trisms'), and the player can clear away Trisms by making three or more of the same color touch. These Trisms then disappear, and more slide on-screen. The direction that the new Trisms slide in from is determined by the position that the player holds the iPhone. A skilled player can use varying directions to their advantage, allowing for combos of multiple Trisms being cleared.</p>\n<p>To complicate matters, Trisms occasionally get 'screwed in', meaning that all the Trisms on that row can no longer be moved, and instead must be cleared to restore the row back to normal. Other Trisms may become bombs with timers on them - if the player doesn't clear these dangerous Trisms before the timer runs out, the bomb explodes and it's Game Over!</p>\n<p><em>Trism</em> has three different modes of play:* Infinism - play for as long as you can! There's no time limit here, it's just the bombs that can end your game.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Terminism - a timed game - keep clearing those Trisms to stay in the game!</li>\n<li>Syllogism - a puzzle mode where you have a set amount of moves to clear all the Trisms in play.</li>\n</ul>",

Stock market prices are plummeting, and suicidal investors are jumping out of the windows. Catch them before they hit the pavement!</p>\n<p>The player must move the two firefighters to catch the investors as they quickly jump out of the windows. The arc of their jump and the window they jump out of varies, meaning that their landing positions are unpredictable.</p>\n<p><em>Bank Panic</em> also has the option to get the latest Dow Jones stock quotes. The lower the figures, the faster those investors will keep jumping.</p>",

They can either tap one tile, then the other, or drag between the two tiles.  This will swap it for any other tile on the play field - unless an object, such as an enemy or the player ball is in the way.  Using this mechanic, the player can trap enemies away to prevent them from escaping, or forge their own path to the slalom tile (slalom tiles are the only ones that cannot be moved).</p>\n<p>The player can also tilt the device to physically move the ball around the playfield.  The amount of speed the ball moves around depends on how much tilt is applied, and can allow the player to get out of otherwise dangerous situations.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Ruben &amp; Lullaby</em> the player is called in as a spectator when the lovers Ruben and Lullaby are having their first fight while sitting on a bench in a park. Called an <em>opertoon</em> by the developers - part comic, part game, part musical instrument - the player can choose to remain passive and let the conversation unfold, or interfere and steer the outcome. Although no words are spoken and no text appears to explain their feelings, it is up to the player to decide when they talk to each other (implied) and how they react.</p>\n<p>This is done using the motion control of the mobile device. By tilting it left or right, the player decides who is speaking or reacting, shifting the screen to close in on the character of choice. They can be enraged by shaking the device (the screen turns red) or by gently rubbing it (the screen turns blue). Through this mechanic, the implied flow of the fight is decided by the player - who speaks? who's silent? - eventually leading up to a reunion or a break-up. Music and sound is also interwoven. The jazz arrangement adapts to the emotions; hi-hats building up rage, a piano chord when shifting the focus, the bass announcing tensions, brass softening the atmosphere. As such, the sound and drawn graphics are the only lead to follow the story.</p>",

The twist that makes SCRAP! interesting is that the orientation you must complete lines in, switches at random and is highlighted along one side of the game board. In lieu of gravity, you have a given amount of time (dependent on your current level/difficulty) to place the piece before it is moved to the SCRAP! pile. Pieces can be retrieved from the SCRAP! pile (limit one per turn) and placed on the game board. Don't let the pile build up too much, or your game will come to an end.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Vector Tanks</em> is a firstperson tank shooter with retro-styled vector graphics. It is designed by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/362815/peter-hirschberg/\">Peter Hirschberg</a>, the inventor of the translucent vector effect technique in the mid 1990s.</p>\n<p>The premise is simple: the player commands a tank on the battlefield and needs to blast all enemies to bits. The tank is controlled through two gauges, one on each side of the screen. Much like vertically-oriented analogue sticks, players need to move them up or down using the touch screen to move forward, backward and turn. Tapping the screen makes the tank fire. There are two types of enemies, the battlefield is filled with mines and obstacles, and next to regular shells power-ups such as a shield, rapid fire and a nuke can be picked up.</p>\n<p>The screen shakes visibly when taking damage or landing heavy fire, and new enemies spawn as soon as the old ones are destroyed. The game keep track of the player's overall score.</p>",

Each world has a unique art style and different game mechanics, including bombs, fans, levers, pulley systems, pushable debris, light beams, \"drawn paths\" (dynamic surfaces drawn by touching and dragging on the screen) and motorized platforms.

The high and low is: nasty red demons have invaded the kingdom's suspiciously grid-like battlefield, and threaten to overwhelm its defenses as they randomly proliferate from round to round.  The player is in charge of mustering the defenses (with nine different unit types to draw on, randomly dealt, making the most of their unique fire pattern) in such a fashion that in a given round they eliminate as many of the invaders as possible in grand chain reactions.  If at the end of a round there remain more than 10 demons on the battlefield, the player has lost.</p>",

The 7 cars available are rated for speed, weight, boost, and turning. On the course, the player's car and the computer-controlled car relentlessly pursue each other while firing bullets and missiles. The player controls his car by tilting the iPhone or iPod Touch in different directions in order to turn, while there are buttons for the gas pedal, brake pedal, and one button each for the offensive options.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Theseus</em> is an electronic conversion of the <em>Theseus and the Minotaur</em> pencil-and-paper maze puzzle by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Robert+Abbott\">Robert Abbott</a>, based on the concept of logic mazes where certain limitations in movement apply.</p>\n<p>The game consists of 85 mazes with an increasing difficulty to solve, designed by the original author, one of the early converters <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Toby+Nelson\">Toby Nelson</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/382751/claude-guy-quimper/\">Claude-Guy Quimper</a>. Players need to guide Theseus (represented by a blue ball) towards the exit of the maze, while avoiding the minotaur (represented by a horned, red ball). The goal of each level is to reach the exit, but this cannot be done by travelling towards it directly. Theseus is only able to move one tile at at time, while the minotaur can do two. To reach the exit, Theseus has to outsmart the minotaur by luring him into a specific position, exploiting the internal movement logic. The minotaur will not chase after Theseus directly, but approaches him based on rules of vertical and horizontal movement. For instance, when Theseus is on the same horizontal line as the minotaur, but with a wall between them, he is able to move left and right as much as he wants without having the minotaur move. At certain moments it is also needed to delay an action or skip the turn, to lure the minotaur into a certain path without moving Theseus.</p>\n<p>The game is entirely controlled through the touch screen and includes an automatic save function, an undo and reset button, and different hints. The game also keeps track of the amount of moves that was needed to solve the puzzle and provides an award based on the result.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Squibs Arcade</em> is a collection of games inspired by contemporary video games, distilling the game play to its most fundamental form, and re-imagining them with the style of the classic LCD games. There are seven games in total, each with its own gameplay mechanics, and all homages and parodies of the games which inspired them. </p>\n<p>In <em>Crowd Wader</em>, for example, the player needs to step left and right trying to avoid a hail of pedestrians crossing his path, while progressing to steal a merchant's purse and return home with it. </p>\n<p><em>Fantasy Turn Base</em> comes in two parts. The first is an arbitrary walk through the forest which ends only when meeting a monster. Then follows a twitch response game where the monster's fiery breath need to be blocked.</p>\n<p><em>Cardboard Axel Mush</em> is a sneak-em-up in a cardboard box. Sneak past the guards by carefully timing movement left and right \u2013 if they turn around, and the character is not in a position hidden by a box, they will spot him! This, like the others, uses similar movements controls (left/right/fire) as per the old LCD games which moves the player (and enemies and missiles) into one of several discrete positions.</p>\n<p>In <em>We're Fat</em> Shigeru needs to avoid the cakes and eat carrots to stay healthy, in <em>Gun Cogs</em> the player needs to collect cogs while avoid getting shot, <em>Regret the Fist</em> is about dodging enemy attacks and <em>Call of Honour</em> is a shooting game set inside a maze.</p>\n<p>All games are presented in the traditional LCD way with original stickers, scratches and all.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Hi, How Are You</em> is a game featuring the artwork and music of the independent artist and singer songwriter <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Daniel+Johnston\">Daniel Johnston</a>. In his psychedelic universe of good and evil, Satan turns the player's character Jeremiah into a frog, known from the drawing titled <em>Hi, How Are You</em> and popularized into the mainstream by late Nirvana member <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/273645/kurt-cobain/\">Kurt Cobain</a> who wore it on a T-shirt during quite some of his shows.</p>\n<p>The player needs to guide Jeremiah through twenty-five levels to reverse the curse and rescue a girl, using tilt controls or using the on screen joystick controls. The brightly coloured, cel shaded levels are filled with obstacles, platforms and enemies. To complete a level, all squares on the floor need to lighted. This is done by moving over them, but passing twice disables them again. This earns the player a bronze medal, but silver and gold are also available for an extra challenge. To reach silver, all normal blocks need to be lighted, as well as the hard-to-reach challenge blocks. For gold, the same needs to be done, but in a strict time limit.</p>\n<p>The game is in full 3D, with a camera that can rotate in a 360-degrees angle. Tapping the screen makes Jeremiah jump and there are also a number of springs that automate the process. There are four characters available (unlocked progressively). Players can also make available twenty pieces of Johnston's art by unlocking achievements. The music is of course all based on tracks by the artist.</p>",

The game opens with the protagonist answering the call to employment they'd been awaiting all this time: \"Person with superior reasoning ability required.\"</p>\n<p>While book readers have to hunt for numbered paragraph references like backwards primitives, in the mobile electronic version of the gamebook plot fork selections are picked from a list by touching them. In the app version of the gamebook additional material that didn't make it into the print run can be read and enjoyed, and the program also automates die-rolling and tracking of the character's vital statistics (WPM, IQ, BMI and OCD score on top of the conventional SKILL, STAMINA and LUCK).</p>",

        "description": "<p>The year is 2145. Sometime in June, at approximately 21:00 hours UMT, something went very wrong on Mars. At the Delta Labs of the UAC Research Facility located in Mars City, an experiment triggered an unknown event, resulting in the invasion of the entire facility. Marine forces have been deployed to hot spots everywhere. Bravo Team was sent to the EnPro facility but was ambushed while searching for survivors. One of the first tasks for the players of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=DOOM%C2%B3\">DOOM\u00b3</a> was to locate said Bravo Team. One thing was not known at that time: not the entire team was killed during the ambush. One other lone marine survived the attack and managed to make his way to the final evacuation ship. In <em>DOOM Resurrection</em>, the player now follows the story of this marine.</p>\n<p>The game is a so-called rail-shooter. Looking through the eyes of the marine, the player automatically moves through the levels on a pre-determined path with scripts triggering every enemy spawn and cutscene. The player's only task is to aim, shoot and dodge incoming fire. To fend off the already known enemies ranging from zombies over dead soldiers to full-grown hellknights, the player has access to up to three weapons at the same time. The assault rifle is the default one with unlimited ammo. All other weapons require ammunition that can found everywhere in the levels and is collected by simply touching the screen at that location. Health kits can be collected in a similar manner. The other weapons include the normal and double-barrel-shotgun, the Gatling gun and the BFG, which are found at pre-determined points during the game.</p>\n<p>The marine is not completely alone on his journey. While a helpful scientist will keep in contact most of the time, a flying robot called Sam follows the player around, opening doors and providing the link to the scientist. If the player is tired of escaping the research facility, he can try and beat one of the available challenges, among which are killing a hellknight without receiving any damage and with 100% accuracy or finishing a section of the game in only one minute.</p>",

If he keeps hitting the balls correctly, his multiplier will go up until it reaches a maximum of 8x which is activated by shaking the device. In addition special balls come down the ramp which unlock access to power-ups if all hit correctly like a temporary 16x-multiplier.</p>\n<p>The game features four difficulty modes ranging from easy to extreme. Hard and extreme are played in landscape-mode and feature four and five lanes instead of the normal three. Also available are four unlockable boss tracks and a battle mode either against the computer or over bluetooth against another player which features various kinds of weapons that obstruct the view for a few seconds.</p>",

The graphics as well as the overall gameplay-mechanics remain the same as in the original game. The player takes on the role of a mayor and has to build up the ultimate city from scratch. To do so he builds infrastructure like roads and water-pipes, declares building zones and places public buildings where needed always having an eye both on the immigration-rate and the cities finances. Consultants and statistics are there to help the player find the current problem-areas in the city.</p>\n<p>As opposed to the original game, the maps in the handheld-version are smaller but on the other hand the building-slots can now hold much more inhabitants making up for the difference. The controls have also been changed to be able to build the city with a touch-screen. The main difference being that something the player builds won't immediately show up on the map. Instead he can make changes to the placement like increasing the length of the road or move it around a bit before giving the final order to build. In addition the way water and electricity work has been changed a bit. In the original each house needed a connection to the pipes and pylons as long as no other house near it had one. Now the connections automatically supply a certain area around them weather or not a house has been build directly on it similar to the way roads work.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This version of <em>Paperboy</em> is a remake of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4577/paperboy/\">Atari game</a> of the same name. The player still takes on the role of the paperboy who has to deliver papers to his customers while inflicting as much damage as possible to the houses of his non-customers. To make things more difficult, numerous obstacles get in his way including construction workers, rogue tires, skateboarders, dogs and cats and more. If the player hits one of these he immediately looses one life. If all lives have been lost or the player has lost all his customers by not delivering a paper or destroying their property, the game ends. Additional lives are added when the player earns enough points. Points are earned depending on where the newspaper lands. If the player hits the mailbox of a customer, he gets more points than hitting the doormat. Houses of non-customers on the other hand give points when windows break or the player drives over the priceless flowers in the yard. At the end of each day, a training course awaits for additional points.</p>\n<p>New in this version are the enhanced graphics in the classic isometric view and the optional 3D-view as well as three new game-modes. Besides the classic-mode where everything plays exactly as the original, there's the somewhat easier casual-mode. Here points and such can also be earned by collecting cards scattered on the ground. The other modes are time-attack, finish the day as fast as possible, and the challenge-mode where the player has to fulfill certain objectives during his workday.</p>",

He uses the things he steals to help townsfolk and solve problems. The citizens have given him a nickname - the Moon Dancer.</p>\n<p>Created by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Gen+Suzuki\">Gen Suzuki</a>, maker of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=083717500278\">Ninja Five-O</a>, <em>Grappling Action: Moon Dancer</em> is a side-scrolling platformer that is played with the iPhone's accelerometer and touch screen. The player moves Moon Dancer by tilting the device left or right, and throws out his grapple by tapping the screen where you want the grapple to end. As with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=013388110087\">Bionic Commando</a>, Moon Dancer cannot jump and thus must use his grapple to traverse through all terrain. The grapple can also be used to snag far-off objects while Moon Dancer is flying through the air - he also gains bonus multipliers for every moon coin he grabs without touching the ground (up to a maximum of x8).</p>\n<p>Depending on the level, Moon Dancer must either find one or more objects and either give them to people, or use them (such as a key to unlock a door). By swiping the bottom of the screen from left to right, the inventory is displayed, allowing Moon Dancer to use items. The other goal a level may have is to reach the exit - in this kind of level, it's up to Moon Dancer to find the exit, which is marked by a large arrow that points him in the right direction.</p>",

There are also bonus items in addition to the classic Power Pellet - the Splitting Scroll, which allows Pac-Man to split up into multiple versions of himself which ghosts cannot touch, and a Lucky Present, which turns all remaining pellets into Power Pellets.</p>\n<p>There are now more obstacles in the mazes to make things trickier for Pac-Man. Warp Panels teleport Pac-Man to other areas in the maze, Dash Panels allow Pac-Man to briefly run in the direction of the arrow, Tunnels let Pac-Man hide from view, Doors and Bridges prevent Pac-Man from crossing, and Elevators allow Pac-Man to travel to different levels in the maze.</p>",

The ball gutters if you roll into a brook. The curved bases of the tree trunks allow a slingshot effect as you roll.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Bird Strike</em> the player indirectly controls a bird in order to get the highest score in the different levels. To do so, the player flings the bird up in the air via touch-screen at the beginning of a level and then has to move the device around in order to alter the flight-path of the little birdie. But the initial fling won't push the bird very far up so in order to get higher and higher, the bird has to hit rockets or enter an air-stream to get further up. Once the bird reaches the top of the level, an UFO infuses him with energy and he falls down the whole level, destroying everything in his path until he hits the ground and the level ends.</p>\n<p>Several obstacles hinder the birds fly upwards including steam-beams, balloons and other birds. Most of these obstacles are normally indestructible on the players way up and have to be avoided at all costs or the bird will stop his ascent and fly down until he hits another rocket or is back on the ground. Power-ups scattered around the level including a helmet which allows the bird to destroy objects even on his way up and an umbrella which slows down his descent help the player to get the highest score possible. In order to score points, the bird on the other hand needs to collect seeds and destroy as many objects as possible. Bonus points are earned if the player hits the sewer entrance on his way down or performs a really high climb with just one rocket.</p>",

Bronze unlocks the next stage of levels and silver unlocks a new lemming skin. The gold medal unlocks a so-called menu achievement that lets the menus of the game grow by adding new eye-candy items and nice gimmicks.

        "description": "<p><em>Penguin Angel</em> is a casual game for the iPhone. In the game, penguins have escaped from the London Zoo and are wandering the city streets, while at the same time - in a nod to Charles Fort's work on historical anomalies - strange objects are raining from the sky. The player takes control of the penguins' guardian angel, who protects them by pushing away falling objects before they hit the penguins. There are 3 levels of difficulty and 19 stages to complete.</p>\n<p>The game uses the device's accelerometer as the control input. Players tilt the device up, down, left and right to control a guardian angel that flies above the penguins. The goal is to use the angel to push the falling objects away from the penguins. Each level is a timed stage, occurring in a different location in Victorian London. Players receive the \"Perfect\" badge if they complete a level without any of their penguins having been hit; this award carries over to later levels as long as no penguins are hit.</p>\n<p>The game stands out because of its distinctive Victorian art style and quirky aesthetics. The art direction used original prints from the nineteenth century as the basis of the game art, from the characters to the backgrounds. The game levels progress through a series of street and city scenes, gradually leading to a cemetery in the final three levels. The falling objects also become increasingly menacing, with the bicycles and clocks of the early levels giving way to pianos, skeletal horses, and scimitars later on.</p>\n<p>The game's idiosyncrasy comes through in other touches. The penguins, somewhat mysteriously, wear a variety of hats, sashes, and ties publicized in Victorian magazines. A peculiar comic figure, waving a wreath and a banner saying \"Cheers!\", pops down from the top of the screen after the player has pushed a certain number of objects away. The game's difficulty levels are not easy, medium, and hard, but rather \"Easy-Peasy,\" Middling,\" and \"Dreadful.\" The game also uses fonts typical of nineteenth-century publications.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Earth Vs Moon</em> is an arcade shooter game that combines elements from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Missile+Command\">Missile Command</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Space+Invaders\">Space Invaders</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Galaxian\">Galaxian</a>.</p>\n<p>In this game it is up to the player to defend the earth from the invading moon. This is done in traditional <em>Missile Command</em> style with three missile installations that can fire projectiles to destroy incoming bombs. The player determines where to fire by tapping on the screen. The missiles take a while to arrive, thus the player has to predict where the incoming bombs will be at the time of explosion.</p>\n<p>Each bomb that reaches the Earth scorches part of its surface. The player is game over if the entire earth is scorched. But after each level the Earth resets again.</p>\n<p>Aside from falling bombs also Space Invader-like alien ships will descend towards the earth in their typical zigzag pattern. Destroying one of them with your missiles often causes a chain reaction taking out quite a lot of them. </p>\n<p>There are various boss levels in the game as well. In these levels other arcade games are mimicked such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pong\">Pong</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Breakout\">Breakout</a>.</p>\n<p>The simple story is told through newspaper articles.</p>\n<p>Aside from the story mode the game also features Boss Attack and Score Attack. The first is a time attack for all the boss levels. In the second the player has to get as much points as possible in a randomly generated level.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Celebrating one of our rarer extreme sports, this game simulates the rough-and-tumble passtime of tall bike jousting, where fabricators of bicycles of unusual height attempt to knock each other off of their precarious and barely-welded-together steeds, generally after the consumption of copious quantities of alcoholic beverages. After selecting a game mode (single-bout or inter-city tournament) a player is presented with the driver's seat view from atop a rickety tall bike; pedaling is simulated by stroking the sides of the screen to get up to speed, and the \"lance\" (generally padded bamboo or PVC piping) is targeted by tapping the approaching tattooed opponent (but not on their head, one of the sports' few rules.) The game does some calculations behind the scenes following the critical moment of encounter and then employs ragdoll physics to display the outcome of the match in slow-motion.</p>\n<p>There is an RPG element where successful players get to develop various stats which assist in retaining control of their vehicle; also, the player's tall bike may be upgraded (or repaired following damaging dismounts) between bouts. The world circuit transports the player to such exotic cycling climes as Brooklyn, Minneapolis, Reno, New Orleans, Hong Kong and Amsterdam, and eventually they may find themselves up against World Tall Bike Joust Champion <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/310772/ryan-doyle/\">Ryan Doyle</a>, part of the real-world Black Label freak bike mechanic crew and subject of Fountainhead Films' 2007 documentary <em>B.I.K.E.</em> which this game ties in to.</p>",

Gaining experience is player by playing a <em>Tetris Attack</em>-like game. The game field is build up from runes and the player needs to line them up three (or more) of a kind to remove them and score points. Unlike <em>Tetris Attack</em> removed runes aren't immediately refilled from the top of the screen. Instead the screen slowly scrolls upward revealing more and more runes. The player can also tilt The screen to make the block fall to the left or right. The player can speed up by swiping the runes upwards.</p>\n<p>Player vs Player battles can be performed in the arena but are asynchronous. Thus players don't fight against each other live. Instead a player challenges another player by fighting the AI and the other player has to beat that score.</p>\n<p>Players can practice on their own in the single player areas of the game which is more or less the same as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Aurora+Feint:+The+Beginning\">Aurora Feint: The Beginning</a>.

These maps are made up out of links that each connect two nodes. The nodes include keywords that are in turn linked to a question and if the player can answer it correctly then the next path along his progression of the map will be uncovered. Players can choose the route that they want to proceed along depending on the theme or subject that they know most about to try to improve on their chances.</p>\n<p>Map My Mind features different question types like for instance \u201corder\u201d and \u201cpair-matching\u201d questions and wildcards that the player can use to help him progress through the maps. These work by making answering the questions a little easier for the player. The 50% wildcard removes half of the possible answers and the \u201cAsk the host\u201d wildcard allows the player to doublecheck his answer before committing to it. While answering a question incorrectly will lock the question and effectively block the players progression path he can use up one of his three lifelines to unlock the question again and try it again. Exploring the map will allow the player to find and unlock more wildcards and lifelines for use but in order to access them the player must first complete a mini-game.</p>\n<p>Map My Mind comes bundled with 15 maps covering different subjects including but not restricted to: Movies, Geography, Sports, Pop and Rock Music, Superheroes and History. There is also the possibility to download some extra maps covering other subjects.</p>\n<p>In addition to the main Map mode the game includes a Trivia mode in which the player either has a limited time to answer a certain number of questions, or a survival mode where he can play until he answers a question incorrectly. The game offers online leader boards, which allow players to compare themselves to others in their region, country or around the world.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ant Wars SE</em> is basically a simple but very fast real-time-strategy game with ants as the main protagonists, where the only goal is to eradicate each and every enemy unit on the map. At the start of the game, the player can choose between three types of units, differing in one of three aspects: speed, agility and propagation. Propagation is especially important since units can't be built but are instead automatically generated in all anthills occupied by the player. At the start of each of the 51 missions the player mostly has only one anthill with a few units already inside at his disposal. Scattered around the map are uninhabited anthills and of course anthills owned by the enemy.</p>\n<p>Since new units are generated in anthills, the player has to capture other anthills in order to increase production. This is accomplished by selecting one or more anthills with at least 7 ants in them and sending them to the desired target. If the player's army is greater than the one currently in that anthill, he'll vanquish the foes and gain control over the hill. Once every enemy anthill has been claimed by the player this way, he wins.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Chromixa</em> is a puzzle game that requires the player to fill up empty geometric shapes by putting other geometric shapes of different proportions in it. To increase the complexity, each shape is composed of one or more colors, requiring the players not only to fit the shapes inside the form, but also rotate and place the shapes in such a way that the overlapping colors combine to match the color of the form. Once all shapes have found their position and have changed to a united color, the level has been successfully completed.</p>\n<p>As the player progresses through the main game, he unlocks up to four arcade-style mini-games. Like the main game, they heavily rely on the use of color. \"Bounce\" for example features a ball of a specific color flying around inside an empty geometric shape. The player has to turn the shape in such a way that the ball hits the side of the same color, otherwise the game is lost. After the ball hits the correct side, he bounces back and changes his color.</p>",

More points are earned by collecting gold stars hanging around the levels. The player can force the snowboarder to increase speed by holding him down with his finger, make him jump by sliding over the screen and tilt the device to produce back and frontflips. If the snowboarder lands on his head, falls down a hole or is killed by saw blades, the game is over and it restarts at the last checkpoint.</p>\n<p>The game also plays with gravity, turning it upside down when the player drives over a yellow arrow and flipping the screen while doing so, forcing him to turn the device 180\u00b0 in order to continue.</p>",

The job of the player is to prevent that in this castle-defense-variant. To do so, the player can pick up the normal bankers, throw them around or shake them until their cloth fall off and they run away ashamed. Each type banker is vulnerable and immune to a specific attack. The second type of banker for example uses his briefcase to prevent the player from flinging him in the air and hoping he falls to his death.</p>\n<p>To help the player with the increasing number of bankers, he can buy three types of defenses: a sniper, a tank and Uncle Sam. Each one has a solid automatic and a more powerful, manually triggered attack that thins the ranks of the bankers but requires more or less time to become available again. Uncle Sam for example activates a orbital laser which instantly kills any type of banker and seriously hurts the CEO. Each defense unit can be upgraded in several stages with the money dropped by killed bankers. Sometimes they even drop items like credit cards which need to be collected manually but significantly increase the money gained.</p>\n<p>The game is divided into waves of increasing difficulty and ends once all of the bailout money has been stolen by the bankers.</p>",

They'll start go get impatient and drive through even if the traffic light is currently red or they gas runs out. The ladder case requires the player to manually refuel them by moving a gas-canister over them. The game features different levels but has no goal other than getting as many cars as possible from one side of the screen to the other. It only ends when two cars crash into each other.

But only those balls can be removed that have direct contact to at least one other ball. Depending on the game-mode, there are up to six different colors on the board the player has to deal with. Once a group of same-colored balls has been removed, the balls above will fall down and will in the best case form another cloud of balls that is worth removing. The game ends either when the board is cleared or no two balls of the same color in direct contact are left to select and remove. The only goal is to get the highest score by playing as long as possible and always removing many balls of the same color at once.</p>\n<p>To spice things up, there are four game-modes available to chose from. Besides the mentioned Basic-mode, these are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Nonstop</strong> - When a column gets cleared, new balls are generated.</li>\n<li><strong>Slide</strong> - Plays the same as Basic but instead of only dropping down, the balls also slide to the right to fill the empty space when a cluster of balls is cleared.</li>\n<li><strong>Combo</strong> - Combines the game-modes Basic, Nonstop and Slide.</li>\n</ul>",

Hitting a cacti while being attached to it with a web is also not a good idea. All this will lead to an untimely death.

To find the code, the player places pins with different colors or symbols on the board. Once the row has been filled, the game tells him how many pins have the correct symbol or color and are in the correct place. It won't however tell the player exactly which pins are correct, making it a game of trial and error.</p>\n<p>The game features four difficulty levels starting on easy with a secret code which consists of four colors/symbols and can only contain one of the seven available colors to master with five colors/symbols, nine different colors and the increased challenge that the colors/symbols can be contained more than once in the secret combination.</p>",

Using a paddle and a ball, the player has to destroy every last brick on the screen while making sure that the ball doesn't fall down the screen. Not every brick can be destroyed by one hit however. Some even can't be destroyed with the normal ball at all. In these cases the many different power-ups come in handy. They are dropped by destroying special glowing bricks on the board and activated by simply collecting them with the paddle. Besides power-ups like an increased paddle size, an acid ball which goes through everything or the ability to automatically shoot rockets for a short amount of time, there are also non-beneficial ones dropping like instant death or paddle-shrinkage.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This release of <em>Siberian Strike</em> includes the whole story and features all the levels which where previously released in two parts as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Siberian+Strike\">Siberian Strike</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/25195/siberian-strike-episode-ii/\">Siberian Strike: Episode II</a>. The goal of the game is the destruction of the Stalin-Bot, a crossbreed of Stalin and the future MIR Space Station, who owns the vodka producing company Stalinka Corp. The company is behind a communist invasion because they produce genetically engineered vodka that completely annihilates the willpower of those who drink it.</p>\n<p>To do the job, the player can choose between one of three pilots and airplanes at the start of the story mode. While Eliza McCampbell's R-51 Thunder is the fastest plane in the game, it's not very powerful. Pappy T. Wilder on the other hand uses the B-27 Sicarius, a slow but powerful bomber. The third pilot is Eliott Freeman with his balanced P-69 Conquest. Each plane also features four different paint-jobs which need to be unlocked first by playing through the game with that plane. In addition, additional difficulty levels become only available after killing the Stalin-Bot.</p>\n<p>The main part of the game is a vertical-scrolling top-down-shooter. The player moves his plane around the screen in order to avoid the enemy projectiles while firing all available cannons and collecting the power-ups dropped by destroyed enemies. These include more powerful weapons as well as extra lives or a shield which makes the player immune to all damage for a few seconds. If the player destroys a group of enemies who all belong to the same squad, a medal drops. Once the player has collected 100, an additional continue becomes available after all his lives have been lost, allowing him to get right back in the game - although without all the power-ups he had upon death. Most of the levels feature one or more bosses.</p>\n<p>In a few levels, the game switches to a third-person-perspective. Here, the player's main goal is to avoid the many obstacles in his path while the game automatically targets the automatic turrets along the route. The player just has to press a button once targeting has been completed. These levels also don't feature any power-ups.</p>\n<p>The game features a Wi-Fi-multiplayer-mode in which two players shoot their way to the Stalin-Bot cooperatively.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Similar to games like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/13019/bridge-builder/\">Bridge Builder</a>, the player has to build a bridge over a gap using limited resources with the goal of helping up to nine animals get across. The animals weigh differently with the parrot being the most light and the mammoth the most fat one so the player has to make sure his bridge is solid enough to take the weight - at least for a short amount of time. The bridges itself consist of planks of a certain maximum length which can only be connected to other planks or anchor points around the gaps.</p>\n<p>To increase the stability without spending all the available wood, some levels feature a bungee-rope that can be connected to the anchor-points of the planks. Some levels on the other hand don't feature any anchor-points at all at the start. In these cases, the player has to look for destructible scenery in order to create anchor-points. And other levels even require the player to change the location of the sun to influence the water-level and reveal new anchor-points.</p>\n<p>While the level is already completed once all the animals are safely across, to really master a level, the player has to do it using the least amount of planks and at the same collect all the golden eggs that are scattered around the level and may not be on the easiest path over the gap.</p>",

The player automatically flies through the levels with only the ability to move Xio around the screen and ordering him to shoot at incoming enemies. Flying into the screen from both the front and the back, the player has to do his best to avoid their projectiles and kill them as fast as possible. To do so he can either target them one by one or swipe the screen to shoot at more than one at the same time. Additionally, if the situation becomes too desperate for Xio, he can use a bomb, clearing the whole screen by doing so. At the end of each level a boss awaits.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Blue Defense!</em> is a classic shooter game. You are the defender of the blue planet have to destroy the incoming red fleet. The planet fires a constant stream of bullets directly upwards. By tilting or even rotating the device you can aim at incoming enemies. The planet starts with roughly 6.7 billion inhabitants. Every impacting enemy kills part of the population and the game ends when the last inhabitant is killed.</p>\n<p>The game is essentially endless, i.e. it is all about surviving as long as possible and getting a high score. The scoring is innovative; every enemy killed will increase a score multiplier and therefore increase the rate at which you get points in the future. Every hit your planet takes will halve the multiplier, however. There are a number of different levels but the order is random every time you play the game. The game also gets faster the further you progress. It is also possible to directly select and practice a particular level.</p>",

To do so, the player has access to up to five different units (three land and two air) which he/she builds and upgrades in exchange for gold. Once a unit is finished, it will automatically walk from the player's base to the enemy base on a side-scrolling 2D-plane. If an enemy unit crosses its path, they'll fight until one of them is destroyed with the winner earning the same amount of gold the owner of the destroyed unit paid for it. In addition turrets are available to defend the base even when an enemy unit makes it through.</p>\n<p>The game starts with both parties controlling cavemen and dinosaurs but over the course of the game, the era changes to Ancient Egypt, Medieval Ages, the Wild Wild West, World War II to the present day. With it, the available units and upgrades change. While at first there's a caveman with a club, in the end the player will build F14s, helicopters and armored vehicles to destroy the enemy's base.</p>\n<p>If fighting the AI gets boring, two players can either engage in combat on the same device or through a WiFi-connection.</p>",

But before he gets to see the simple 2D-battlefield with his own base on the left and the enemies base on the right side from a fixed side-perspective, he needs to choose for which of the four nations including Rome and Greece. Each of the nations not only differs in looks but also features different units including their very own strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n<p>Once in the game, the player builds offensive and defensive land-based units (like a simple stone defender) and watches them walk automatically to the enemy base and engage the enemy once in range. These fights last until one of the units dies after which the victor continues his path to the enemy base. To build, upgrade and by doing so gaining the advantage over the enemy player, gold is needed which is earned automatically (slow) or by killing enemy units (faster). In addition killing enemy units will earn the player experience points. Once enough have been collected, a level up advances the player to the next of up to five technological evolutions unlocking new types of units as well as additional upgrades.</p>\n<p>The game features a multiplayer-mode for two players using a bluetooth-connection.</p>",

If you tap the right or left side of the screen, you are able to move the camera a bit in that direction to reveal more of the area you are trying to clean (and more dust bunnies).  When dust bunnies appear in the parts of the level that are off screen, an alarm sounds warning you that you should move the camera to reveal more dust bunnies. </p>\n<p>Each level consists of a different room in a house.   In order to complete a level and move on to the next, you must complete each levels objective.  Objectives consist of various tasks such as killing a certain number of dust bunnies, defeating a boss dust bunny, and killing dust bunnies with a certain type of weapon.  The game also has 2 different game modes - Campaign, where you progress level by level, and Survivor mode where you try to last in a single level as long as possible.</p>",

Soon he is called for battle once more to fight back the dark shadow starting to cover the entire continent.</p>\n<p>Through a world map the player chooses a dungeon to go into. Each dungeon consists of several levels with a handful of enemies each. Once facing an enemy the player's goal will be to reduce its hit-points by forming a row of cards you know from the Poker card games. A flush is worth more hit-points than a pair of two cards.</p>\n<p>The player will find 3x3 cards in each level. His or her deck of cards will then be used to add two cards per turn on each side of the 3x3 board. One card opposites the second forming five cards in a row. </p>\n<p>Defeating enemies earns the player gems that can be spent on new bags (increased hit-points), new weapons (stronger attack rate) or shields.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Blue Attack</em> is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Blue+Defense\">Blue Defense</a> by the same author. You control a starfighter launched from the blue carrier and must destroy the red ships before they reach and destroy your carrier. Your fighter may be accompanied by up to 8 wingmen that increase your firepower. The game is essentially a 2D shooter. The blue squadron can either be controlled with the accelerometer or using a touch interface. Red ships are complex geometrical shapes that must be destroyed step by step. Every ship contains a core that must be destroyed in order to blow up the whole ship.</p>\n<p>The ultimate goal of the game is to destroy the red planet. In campaign mode you select your next attack target on a map screen. You cannot select the difficulty directly; instead, more difficult levels only become available if you have completed the previous level below a time limit. There is also an infinite mode where you simply try to survive wave after wave. In between levels you can buy upgrades for your fighters, buy single-use items like bombs or replace lost fighters. Completing levels faster earns you more resources to spend in the shop.</p>",

This is the first episode in a series that relies on voice actor performance and stereo sound design, rather than a visual interface, as the primary means of \"display\" for the game world. It is a science fiction mystery adventure title centered around the player character Kane Price, a psychic investigator specializing in solving problems of a supernatural nature in the present day Los Angeles area. The game mixes exploration and puzzle play with a narrative that lasts around three hours. In this first episode, <em>Ollie Ollie Oxen Free!</em>, Kane Price and his associates chase ghosts, avoid the law, battle demons and solve a mystery surrounding a lost boy named Ollie. The game has visuals, but these are largely static and the next action is selected based on a number of options presented on the screen. At the bottom of the screen a map can be opened to get an overview of the different locations.</p>",

The story then proceeds down that selected narrative avenue, with its own unforeseen complications, until reaching another junction requiring the player's decision-making input. This adaptation not only incorporates illustrations as did the original, but the multimedia capabilities of the new platform allow sound and other special effects to be part of the gamebook players' experience.</p>\n<p>This gamebook adaptation promises to be the first in a tentative three-game conversion deal..</p>",

This version of the game has received a new look and theme, based around paintings. Your goal, however, remains the same. Rotate the maze around to guide the ball to the goal line. Gravity always pulls downward, so you can navigate around obstacles by moving the maze itself. Coins are littered around the maze which increase your score. Later levels introduce plus symbol pickups (which increase your time) and minus symbol pickups (which decrease it). Whenever you complete a level, your time is presented and converted into points. You also receive extra time for you to continue playing.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>WINtA</em> is a music game created for charity and designed by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/97765/masaya-matsuura/\">Masaya Matsuura</a> know from games such as <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3525/parappa-the-rapper/\">PaRappa the Rapper</a> and other music games.</p>\n<p><em>WINtA</em> stands for \"War is not the answer\" and refers to the title track. Each track is specifically designed with unique graphics and style. The game itself is free and comes with the title track for free. The other tracks can be bought in-game for 99 cents and the proceeds go to charity. New tracks are added periodically to the <em>WINtA</em> store.</p>\n<p>In the game the player is presented with icons in different patterns depending on the song. Some icons will start glowing whenever words are sung. They need to be tapped by the player at the right moment. The better the player times his taps the more point the player earns. Getting chains of correct taps earns multipliers for even more points. To add to the difficulty the camera moves along a predefined path and the playing field isn't sitting still either. When the player fails to tap an icon the words aren't sung out of tune. Special icons function as a whammy and can be shaken with a finger to add effects to the lyrics.</p>\n<p>Using Plus+ the player can collect achievements and compare scores with friends or global leaderboards.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Traveler's Quest</em> is a unique treasure hunting game which uses the GPS to help players detect and bury treasures. Treasures detected are buried by other players, or by \"treasure gnomes\" which help out lonely players. Because the game expects players to move around the world, treasure value changes based on location. The more distance a player puts between the treasure's origin and his or her current location, the more the treasure is worth. Therefore burying a treasure as far away from the origin is very important to the player's daily gold income which is received for every 24 hours a treasure is buried. Extra points are given when collections are completed, and the closer the player is to a treasure's X before picking it up. </p>\n<p>Additionally, rather than a single overall score leaderboard, this game also contains leaderboards for Gold, Treasure Value, Collections and Accuracy. Game Center was also added in the most recent release, allowing players to compare their achievements with their friends.</p>",

Every player across the league is available for traditional 5 on 5 gameplay, as well as legends of the game that can be unlocked during play to mix things up. You can also compete in a 3 point shoot out, or the All-Star game itself.</p>\n<p>Touch screen controls are split into two move sets. The simplest moves are controlled by an on-screen control pad and two action buttons, that change whether you are on offence or defence. Advanced moves such as unique dribbles or dunks can be performed with swipes or double taps on or across the screen during play.</p>",

It's rather more intellectual than this game, but ultimately they share the same concern.</p>\n<p>This game presents a number of aesthetically pleasing abstract geometrical line drawings in black and white, divided up into various complete segments.  At the player's disposal are four pencil crayons, each of a different colour.  The player's challenge in a given level (and there are a lot of them) is to colour in every part of each level's drawing -- tapping on a crayon and then the area flood-fills the area -- without having any two adjacent areas of the same colour.  Making things interesting, every level has a time limit -- and your own manual dexterity on the small iPhone screen may vary.  Areas coloured in error can be re-coloured as often as you like, but the clock is always ticking.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Released as a free game in promotion of the TRON movie sequel Tron: Legacy, this game features both a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Light+Cycle+games\">light cycle</a> mode, and a tank mode. Both versions are available in singleplayer mode and both were available as multiplayer for online play initially. There are also some promotional information for the movie tie-in such as information about the soundtrack by Daft Punk, and information about the movie.</p>\n<p>The single player version of light cycles consist of levels where all other light cycles has to be destroyed in order to continue. The player has a limited number of lives, and have to survive a few waves of AI respawns in order to complete the level. The bikes can run over power-ups to gain access to improvements such as longer light trails, faster speed, and temporary \"god mode\" where the player can run through walls. Online game featured similar gameplay except that the game never ended, and all players respawned as long as they were connected.</p>\n<p>The tank game is a puzzle game in single player mode where the player needs to get to the exit by destroying enemies, items that block the path, and reaching switches that opens closed areas. The tanks has two primary weapons with unlimited ammo, as well as a few limited ones that can only be found in power-ups. Multiplayer version featured only a death match type against other players.</p>\n<p>Online playing were always team mode, where each player selected one of three factions. The only distinction between the teams are their colors, green, cyan, and orange. Each point go towards an persistent overall faction score. The multiplayer servers were shut down, and the features were removed from the app late in 2011.</p>",

The created color is then matched against the original, and players are scored on accuracy. Several hint functions are available to assist the player. Games are averaged over eight stages, and scores can be saved and shared on the OpenFeint gaming network.</p>",

Players will quickly determine that the complex is infested with some species of lethal extraterrestrial life, and survival gets added to the typical adventure game priorities of exploration and puzzle-solving.</p>\n<p>The game was initially released as a $1 download, but is now available for free.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Snake Race</em> is a combination between a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/3173/snake-variants/\">snake game</a>, and a constant scrolling game (such as a Shoot 'em up game). Unlike other snake games, there is no possible way to turn around, the snake can only be led in two directions; right-up, or left-up. Also unlike other snake games, the snake will not die instantly if it hits rocks blocking it paths. Instead some of it's length will be spent in order to drill through these barriers. In addition to the classic power-up where the snake grows, there are power-ups to speed up, or down the movement, as well as some only for more points. Since growing longer can be compared to getting more health in other types of games, the game actually become easier when getting long.</p>\n<p>Unless the player dies by spending all of the snake's length, the game will end after a while, depending on what level is selected. A high score is determined based on how many power-ups the snake was able to eat. The score is also constant granting point as long as the snake is alive. Other bonuses may also grant points.</p>",

They are available in a variety of formats (book, Kindle, Nook, PDF) but the one of the three that interests us here is the iPhone version of <em>Charlotte</em>, the only one of the three released in on that platform.</p>\n<p>The basic premise explored in this gamebook adaptation is that single Charlotte, wanting to light a fire in her love life, buys a ticket on a swinging cruise ship trip to the Caribbean. Unbeknownst to her, the sailing she ends up securing passage on is hosting a very exclusive party, populated by supernatural monsters who walk among us but live apart from us, with distinctive appetites and passions all their own. The swollen moon low in the Atlantic sky also awakens some latent mystical powers in Charlotte herself, such that she can give as good as she can take.</p>\n<p>The story can work through itself in any of eleven different ways, with some romantic successes, some erotic ones, and some downright humiliating failures, all informed by the author's selection of options presented at junctures in the textual narrative.</p>",

The game is divided into single-screen overhead stages, on which the player navigates JR in four directions, trying to avoid roaming enemies. Each stage hides an anime-style picture of a girl underneath it. The goal is to uncover at least 80% of that picture within a time limit by cutting out rectangular portions with JR's path. Enemies trapped inside the uncovered rectangle disappear. Enemies and hazards include thugs, guards, bombs, ninjas, and tanks.

        "description": "<p><em>Mikado Defenders</em> is a tower defence game based in feudal Japan. The object of the game is to defend the castle of each real world location of Japan from hordes of demons. Successfully defending a location opens up a new one and a fully upgraded castle before the final wave provokes a bonus boss wave. There are only a limited number of places; units can be placed however so strategy plays a big part. The units available are swordsmen, archers, spearmen, and cannons. Each unit can also be levelled up at a cost. The game also features many commanders to be unlocked through defeating the bosses, that can then be allocated to units and give them an added bonus and gain themselves exp at the end of the level.</p>",

Each side of the screen is based into three touch zones (top, middle, bottom) that can be tapped to punch or kick the incoming enemies. Tapping two opposite zones allows for a double attack.

There are two game modes \"level up\" and \"time attack\". The modes are split into two variants \"2 some\" and \"3 some\", where the goal is to match two and three tiles respectively. Multipliers are awarded for successive matching. The objective is to line up two or more of the same number horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Every time a move is made, two new numbers appear, so each one needs to be planned very carefully. The numbers are only nominal in nature and most likely are included to help discriminate between different colored blocks.</p>",

At the same time it's important to maintain the right speed when approaching corners to avoid skidding out. To decrease the speed the player simply make slower motions. Once the player has drawn the route the race begins and from here he has no control over the action. The game features 20 tracks against AI drivers in single player. The player can then compare his best results against other players on the national or global leaderboards. The game can also be played in multiplayer either online or locally. When playing locally up to three player take turns drawing their routes.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Challenge!</em> is a strategy game for two players, and is based on the classic board game Agon. The board has five concentric rings of cells and a throne at the center. Each player has a queen and six guards. The game is won by putting the queen on the throne, surrounded by all six guards. The game is however lost if all guards are on the inner ring but the queen is not on the throne.</p>\n<p>The pieces are initially placed in a symmetric pattern on the outer ring. The players take turns moving one piece. Each piece can be moved to an adjacent cell on the same ring or on the next ring closer to the throne. The cell moved to must be vacant. Only the queen can be moved to the throne. A piece cannot be moved \"into capture\".</p>\n<p>A piece is captured if it has enemy pieces on two adjacent sides in a straight line. When a piece is captured, the owner must relocate it on his turn, to the outer ring if it\u00b4s a guard, anywhere on the board if it's the queen. When several pieces are captured, they must be relocated one by one, first the queen if relevant, then the guards in any order.</p>",

In the tradition of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tetris\">Tetris</a>, the screen consists of a single-screen area where blocks drop down from the top. The blocks are crates of different materials/colours (making it accessible for the colourblind) with the sea as a backdrop. Players direct the blocks down to stack them together. When five blocks or more of the same type connect in a group vertically or horizontally, they can be double tapped to make them disappear, making room for new ones. Matches are rewarded with booty in the form of coins that add to the score and combos are also possible.</p>\n<p>Sometimes metal blocks drop down that only get in the way. Dynamite can be used to get rid of them, to blow up neighbouring crates, or they can be diffused for additional booty. There are three skill levels and all of them have the speed go up after time. Next to tapping, the device can also be tilted to fill in the gaps between the crates or create new gaps, sliding them from one side to the other. New players have access to tutorials to explain the mechanics.</p>",

He can do that by flicking away enemies with his finger, using traps and monsters he has bought against his foes, or casting various spells by using natural gestures (for example drawing a circle to spawn a rolling boulder, a jagged line to make a lightning bolt, or a V shape to summon a tornado). The emergent gameplay arises from the fact that all enemies interact with each other - for example, wild boars are enslaved by their masters and the player can free them, causing wild boar rampage in the enemy lines; sorcerers die in a light explosion that blinds other enemies, falling trolls can crush others with their weight, fire skeletons melt frozen enemies, etc.\nTo recap, it's not a difficult game, but it tries to keep surprising the player with the interactions between the enemy units and the new spells and traps the player can unlock.</p>",

The game has accelerometer support and introduces pick-ups, enemies, and different types of level design. Coins and jewels can be collected for additional points. For every 100 points an extra life is granted. There are ten levels in total.</p>",

In this game, you play the titular character whose main goal is to progress the game's levels by swinging and jumping onto platforms of different shapes and sizes, gradually getting more difficult to land on. In order to progress, the player needs to tap the screen once for Mr. AahH to launch a rope into the ceiling, causing him to swing towards the platform. Then, at the right moment the player needs to tap again to release him and get him to land; not timing your taps correctly can lead to your character to miss the platform and lose a life.</p>\n<p>Not only do the platforms become thinner and further apart, but natural forces are also working against you, causing elements such as wind force and gravity to change at nearly every stage, causing the way you jump to constantly change. Players have only 3 lives to land on as many platforms as possible in a game with over 20 levels of varying difficulty.</p>",

Points can be obtained by causing Max to hit and crash into as many obstacles (such as boxes and traffic cones) with extreme force as possible on the way to the end of each level. There are a total of 16 levels in this 3d ragdoll physics-based game.</p>\n<p>The player has to swipe their finger across the screen to give Max the first push towards the exit. Some of the levels also include a power gauge that determines how far and high Max can fly, making timing and precision important aspects in some stages of the game. If Max's body is stuck on an obstacle or can't make it any further, the player has a few extra chances to tap the screen to fling him further. Once all these chances are gone, the player will have to reset the level and try again. Max Injury utilises an online global hi-score system, giving players around the world the chance to compete with the highest scores for each of the levels.</p>\n<p>In addition to Max's original appearance, two other outfits are available from the beginning of the game: a teddy bear outfit and a zombie outfit. These costumes only have a cosmetic use, however, and so they don't affect the gameplay and physics of Max Injury. This game also has another comical feature, in which the player can replace Max's face with any image saved image or photo, giving players the chance to make their friends (or enemies, of course) go through all of the tough and hazardous stages that Max Injury has to offer.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Alive 4-ever Returns</em> the player takes the role over one of four characters who trie to survive the zombie apocalypse. In its core, this game is a two-stick shooter using emulated joysticks which are used to move the character and the shooting direction independently from each other. Besides killing a lot of undead and various bosses, each of the 40 levels also has optional side quests like saving civilians which unlock more weapons and equipment (which have to purchased with found money, though). When a character levels up, it gains ability points (used to improve statistics like maximal health or defense) and skills (recharging abilities which give temporary statistical boosts). However, the player has to choose four skills which can be accessed during gameplay.</p>\n<p>Besides the campaign, there are also two additional playing modes (which consist of surviving as long as possible against undead) and co-op multiplayer.</p>",

The problem with this is that there are a lot of enemies which unleash a lot of projectiles which the player should dodge in order to avoid defeat. </p>\n<p>Before each level, the player gets to choose between one of three difficulty level (which affect the number of enemies and continues) and one of four space ships which differ in handling and weapon configuration. But of course one of the most important task is to upgrade the ship with special weapons so it stands a chance against the opposition, but after losing a life it reverts to the basic setup. Besides simply beating the levels, another challenge is acquiring a place on the online high-score list by using combo attacks. The ship can be either controlled by touch 1:1, touch 2.5:1, tilting or an virtual joystick.</p>",

Other microbes have special powers, e.g. some have the power to regenerate microbes around them and others shoot at the paddles (and each hit has devastating effects on the time limit).

In this game, rather than train idols to perform, the focus is on idol promotion. The player chooses one of 13 available idols from 765 Production and works to make her famous across Japan by gaining lots of fans. This is accomplished by the player physically visiting locations. Job offers appear at locations, and the idol earns fans by completing an event. There are 505 locations spread across 47 prefectures. Registering for an account is necessary to play the game.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there is an augmented reality photo feature that lets the player take pictures of the idols over a backdrop of the real world, a built-in Twitter client that lets players chat with one another, and a clock where the current idol will tell the player what time it is.</p>",

Once you start the game, a question will appear with four possible answers. All you need to do is touch the correct answer. You have a time limit of fifteen seconds per question. After so many correct questions in a row, you reach a checkpoint. If you miss a question, you drop back to the last checkpoint, although the questions do not repeat. When you reach certain checkpoints, you are rewarded with in-game coins. You can use these in-game coins or real-world money to acquire additional question packs.</p>",

It abandons the hook mechanic of the first game, but adds a double jump to the familiar jump and slide moves. The hero GingerBrave is joined by a variety of other gingerbread men, so-called Breakers, with different designs and abilities: for example, GingerBright runs 10% slower, GingerClaus gains twice as much experience points, NinjaBread starts with 3 shields and has the ability to triple jump. Collecting the letters that spell BONUS now leads to a special bonus round. Furthermore, the Breakers are followed by \"Charms\" which aid them in several ways, and players can use in-game currency to buy boosts like shields and score multiplicators before each run.</p>",

It offers a unique control scheme adapted to the platform and several game modes know from earlier entries, but with a unique set of levels.</p>\n<p>Gameplay follows the standard model of the series: the player controls a catapult at the bottom of the screen that shoots randomly colored bubbles into the play field. When three or more bubbles of the same color touch, they are removed. The catapult can be controlled in two different ways: in Sling Shot mode, the catapult direction is manipulated directly, with a \"pull back\" motion used to launch. In Tap Shot mode, the catapult is aimed automatically by touching its targeted location on the screen, then touching the catapult to fire.</p>\n<p>The included game modes are Story, Challenge and VS. Story mode consists of six worlds that series hero Bub traverses on a map. Each consists of several sub-stages which in turn consist of five puzzles to complete. The goal in each level is to clear the pre-set pattern of bubbles. Challenge mode is an unwinnable endless mode played for high score, in which new bubbles are continuously added from the top. VS mode is a two-player mode played via bluetooth connection. In this mode, popping many bubbles at once adds them to the opponent's play field.</p>",

His goal is to find Princess Zenda, obtain a sword and gain access to the front yard of the guardsman. Once he finds Princess Zenda, he must guess her name. If he gets it right, she will give him a sword. After this, he must gather ten coins, two of which must be earned by killing purple mushroom monsters.

        "description": "<p><em>Dawn of the Dead</em> is a game based on the 2004 remake of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=George+Romero\">George Romero's</a> classic zombie movie of the same name. You take refuge at the Crossroads Mall fight only to have a horde of zombies lay siege to its inhabitants. Fight a way through five levels from the parking lot to the underbelly of the mall, as you fight to survive an onslaught of bloodthirsty zombies as one of three characters: a nurse, policeman or salesman (each with different skills). Use guns in addition to axes, baseball bats, golf clubs, and unlock ever more powerful weapons. Play through Story mode first then unlock Survival mode to face waves of zombies. Difficulty levels can be adjusted for the player's ability.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Wizzley Presto and The Vampire's Tomb</em> is a game in the vein of classic <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dizzy\">Dizzy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Seymour\">Seymour</a> series. The player takes control of Wizzley, a bumbling wannabe magician summoned by the king to rid The Shire of some evil vampire. Wizzley's problem? He can't use any magic more complex than card tricks, and so, must complete his quest through other means, mainly a series of inventory puzzles and some rudimentary platforming.</p>\n<p>Wizzley is controlled via directional touch-buttons on the bottom of the screen. What makes this setup rather unconventional, is that the buttons are laid out in a single raw, rather than a D-Pad. The character moves with acceleration, making it difficult to estimate the timing of certain actions, Most unexpectedly, however, the character in this platformer game can't voluntarily jump - moving platforms have to be walked on, enemies can only be avoided by walking away from them, and certain objects hurl Wizzley up in an auto-jump. To interact with puzzles and NPCs, and to pick up or use items, the player has to tap them, which can be tricky based on where on screen the hotspot is.</p>\n<p>The game is split into three chapters, all taking place in the same locations but in two different time periods. Though the game doesn't scroll from one location to the next, the screens are given life through tiny ambient animations like birds flying in the background, or spooky eyes peering out of dark corners.</p>",

There are also two bonus mini-modes: Pelt the Parrot, where the goal is to hit a parrot with as many coconuts as possible in 30 seconds, and Bamboo Bounce, where targets must be hit as many times within 30 seconds, but the fired coconuts must hit a wall at least two times before hitting the target.</p>",

The player is scored based on the number of metres travelled, the number of rings collected, and the number of enemies defeated; an online high score list allowed players to compare their high scores with their friends.</p>\n<p>The app's other primary gaming feature is a one-level time-limited demo of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/48575/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-episode-i/\">Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I</a>, which had been released the previous year. It also featured weekly free downloadable wallpapers and a news feed featuring news about Sonic's 20th anniversary.</p>",

The movie's final scene with the iconic scene in the mansion is expanded into gameplay covering 30 levels in an arcade mode along with an additional survival mode. The entire game is set in different parts of the mansion and features voice samples from the movie.</p>\n<p>Tony Montana is moved around in a 3D environment to different spots automatically as an on-rail shooter. There are on-screen controls for both aiming and shooting. Aiming using an analogue stick on the left makes the screen scroll and can be done in any direction. Optionally auto aiming can be enabled so the player only has to focus on movement. There are also other control schemes possible. Eventually fifteen different weapons can be unlocked. The top of the screen shows the score, the current score multiplier, the remaining health, the current weapon and the remaining ammo. After each level statistics are shown.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Luma</em> is a puzzle game where the player has to guide a beam of light to its target destination. It is played on a board of circular nodes, each which has one piece of the path. Similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/42161/droplitz/\">Droplitz</a> the game is played by rotating each node so that a complete path to the target is created. The game's adventure mode consists of 30 stages and adds more gameplay elements as progress is made. This includes coloured nodes that change the path's colour. It's necessary to match the colour of the end node with the colour of the light. In some levels there are multiple colours that have to be mixed to create the correct colour. </p>\n<p>After completing the adventure mode, a survival mode is unlocked. It has a time limit but also additional tools that can be used. This includes a clock reset and the ability to remove pieces that aren't needed from the board.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ace Combat Xi: Skies of Incursion</em> is a mobile entry in the Ace Combat series. It's a prequel to the PSP game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/29881/ace-combat-x-skies-of-deception/\">Ace Combat X: Skies of Deception</a> and takes place during the Aurelian War when Aurelia is invaded by Leasath. The invading forces are attacking Griswall, Aurelia's capital city, which the player has to defend by taking control over the Falco Squadron. The game's campaign originally consisted of five missions with an additional three maps being added through updates. The original version of the game had a total of five planes of which three were available from the start and the other two being unlockable by beating the game on easy and normal difficulties. Additional planes were available as DLC. </p>\n<p>The game plays similarly to previous games in the series but uses the iPhone's accelerometer to control the planes by tilting. Touch screen buttons are used for throttle and brakes as well as firing machine guns and launching missiles. The tilt controls can be changed to an onscreen d-pad. There is also an autopilot option. Across the campaign, the player has to take down various enemies such as jets, anti-aircraft guns, and tanks. The multi-purpose gauge from Ace Combat X makes a return and is used to show the status of the enemy forces. The game can be played either from a behind view or from a cockpit view.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Terminator: Salvation</em> is a third-person shooter based on the film of the same name. This version of the game was released alongside a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/133007/terminator-salvation/\">feature phone version</a> which it is similar to but differs in being fully 3D. The game is made up of a single-player campaign that consists of eight missions where the player gets to take of control of both John Connor and Marcus Wright, the two protagonists of the movie. After completing the full game, the option to play as a T-600 terminator is unlocked.</p>\n<p>The game is similar to other third-person games of its time with plenty of cover-based shooting. Missions are linear and involve moving from one point to another while destroying all the enemies that appear. This includes humanoid terminators such as the T-600 as well as other robots such as spiders, the tank-like T-1 and the mech-like harvesters. Weapons include shotguns, grenade launchers, and surge cannons. In addition to the regular on-foot-levels, there are two vehicle-based levels, one with a jeep and one with a motorcycle.</p>",

The game only has a single-player story mode in which the player is an undercover cop in the underground racing scene. Missions include two-car races, four-car elimination, cop chases, and combat missions among others. Accelerating is done automatically and to steer, the player needs to tilt the screen. Tilting it more makes the car drift, and touching the screen brakes.</p>",

The gameplay is the same with touch screen arrows being used to play the game in the standard mode while accelerometer controls are used in the shake mode.</p>\n<p>The main difference from Dance Dance Revolution S is the business model. The game was sold at a lower initial price but only included three songs. Additional song packs, each with three songs, could be bought in an in-app store. In total 222 songs were available.</p>",

The goal is to score points and build combos by thinking ahead and queueing moves to then executive them in succession for the best possible result, removing as many tiles as possible. Tiles of the same colour, connected horizontally or vertically, disappear together when they are chosen. No swapping is needed.</p>\n<p>There is only a limited amount of time to choose and queue moves as a bar on the left side of the screen fills up quickly. To keep progressing to new levels quick thinking and building up combos is required, as indicated through a bar near the bottom of the screen, showing what is needed to move on. The game keeps track of the high score. The best scores can be compared worldwide and it is possible to compete against a friend offline on a single device.</p>",

It is not entirely clear if both games are completely identical or whether this an updated re-release, but the 2011 game is confirmed to have been removed from the App Store because Gamopat let the yearly license fee expire.</p>",

In the Story mode the crew's Nimeh ship needs to complete missions to search Earth for survivors and the story unfolds while progressing.</p>\n<p>The turn-based missions take place on small maps that act like grids where units are moved around like chess pieces. The player can view the entire map through zooming and rotation. Strategy involves powerful commanders, various buildings, resources and units with different roles. The environment and type of terrain also play a role. Missions take place over several rounds. Owning the most buildings is a key element to winning as they generate resources each turn to build units. Buildings are colonized by sacrificing ground units.</p>\n<p>There is also a Quick Game mode to replay any campaign from the Store mode or 50 additional maps, and there is support for local multiplayer games using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. In multiplayer actions take place simultaneously on both screen so the opponent can see what the other player is doing. In Quick Games there are three difficulty levels and you can select a Human or Robot commander to gain specific perks.</p>",

The player controls a character with a cannon, spinning around a pivot point where small coloured blobs appear. The goal is to create matches by shooting balls (anti-blobs) among the alien blobs to create matches, thus removing them from the area. The alien blobs are also able to shoot back. Other game elements include level bosses, aliens from the outside rushing in and mines that chase you. There are also various power-ups and collectables. There is a main game mode along with an arcade mode. The player's character is Alice, the daughter of one of a group of scientists that accidentally opened up a portal that led to an alien invasion.</p>",

If the opponent places a ship on one of the squares with a mine, an instant hit is scored at the start of the match. This is not a default gameplay element and it can be disabled.

        "description": "<p><em>Caramella Girls</em> is a mobile rhythm game featuring the popular Eurodance song \"Caramelldansen\". In the game the player has four touch screen buttons: a red square, a blue triangle, a green cross, and a purple circle. During gameplay, control goes back a forth between the game and the player, with the game showing a pattern on the bar at the top of the screen, which the player then has to repeat using the four buttons. If the player fails to do so correctly they lose power, while doing so correctly replenishes their power and adds to their score. The game has three difficulty levels and only one song, Caramelldansen, though the song is available in three different languages that are selectable in the game's settings.</p>",

Compared to the earlier Zeebo game, this game features revised character sprites, completely new backgrounds, and an updated combo system. It also features several entirely new stages that weren't in the previous versions and an EXP system so that players' progress persists between runs.</p>",
