        "description": "<p>The Nokia 6110 smartphone was launched with three games included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Logic</em></li>\n<li><em>Memory</em></li>\n<li><em>Snake</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Logic</em> involves working out combinations of symbols and memory which requires you to match up pairs of symbols that are hidden beneath cards within the least number of moves.</p>\n<p><em>Memory</em> requires you to match up pairs of symbols that are hidden beneath cards within the least number moves.</p>\n<p>For <em>Snake</em> this is the first implementation of the classic game for the Nokia smartphones. It supports a two-player mode using two phones and an infrared connection. The game keeps track of the score and shows in the top left corner. The screen consists of 48 x 84 black and white pixels. The original gameplay design was slightly tweaked so that when the snake reaches the edge of the screen, a tiny delay is added before the crash so that the player has a few more milliseconds to react and save the snake.</p>",
