The game is based on the popular manga <em>Digimon</em>. The hero, a boy named Ryou, has to travel to digital world in order to free his friends from the clutches of the evil digital monster Milenniamon.</p>\n<p>The story of this game is identical to that of \"Anode Tamer\", and gameplay mechanics are exactly the same: you descend into dungeons to fight monsters in turn-based style, capture the monsters after the battles and then send them to fight new ones. The difference between the two games are the monsters themselves: \"Cathode Tamers\" features a brand new set of monsters, and since the beginning of the game you encounter different foes. The full collection of monsters can be achieved only if you complete both games.</p>",

You can feed it some typical hamster food, clean the cage from time to time, and even write e-mails to your hamster. Depending on your actions the disposition of the hamster will change.</p>",

The player character is running sideways on the bottom of the top-down screen, and is shooting the balloons to make them change shapes and match each other.

        "description": "<p><em>Pocket Fighter</em> is a crossover fighting game that takes characters from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Street+Fighter\">Street Fighter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Darkstalkers\">Darkstalkers</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Red+Earth\">Red Earth</a> fighting series, and presents them in a cute shrunken chibi form with ridiculous moves and costumes. The games fights take place in various <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Capcom\">Capcom</a> locations.</p>\n<p>At the top of the screen is your, and your opponents, health bar. Below that is a meter showing how many gems you've collected. Gems are produced from a character when they are hit by a kick or a punch, these gems will then lie on the ground until someone picks them up. Filling up your gem gauge will increase your special attack meters on the bottom of the screen. Ideally one aims to achieve a special attack level of 9 by picking up gems, however, battle will often having you using these up before you reach that lofty number.</p>\n<p>The main difference between the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pocket+Fighter+Saturn\">Sega Saturn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pocket+Fighter+PlayStation\">PlayStation</a> version of <em>Pocket Fighter</em> is a card battle mode. </p>\n<p>In the card battle mode you will be presented with a set of three to six cards to choose from to form an attack, after which you'll view the combat and get new cards to pick from until one player is K.O.'ed.</p>\n<p>The cards will have a attack power and a defense power. By combining cards you'll get an attack, defense, and counter value\nwhich determine an overall power value. The player who has selected the higher power value will attack that turn, unless your foe has picked a guard card, an evasion card, or a high enough counter value. Other cards include recovery cards and special move cards.</p>\n<p>\"Collectible Cards\", cards featuring various graphics of the game's characters, can be obtained by playing the games various modes, such as \"Arcade\", and traded via the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Communication+Cable\">Communication Cable</a></p>\n<p>The game also featured an online high score board through the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=WonderGate\">WonderGate</a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Street Dancer</em> is a rhythm game starring the crew of wuz\u2191b? a Japanese pop music performance group. </p>\n<p>The game features standard with a line of button prompts scrolling across the bottom of the play are that you will have to press when they reach the center of the screen. Before you start a game you will be asked to select a member of the wuz\u2191b? crew; Nana, Kaoru, Shino, or U. As you press buttons the chosen terpsichorean will shake it or stare at you in stupefaction, depending on your performance. A 'life bar' is presented on the screen if you fail to perform well the bar will go down, when it is empty your game ends. To clear a stage and unlock a new background with a harder song you'll have to get about a 60% perfect score. You can always record your performances to watch over and over.</p>\n<p>When a stage is clear you unlock new dance moves, these dance moves will appear in the game and in the \"Step Book\". In the step book you can watch the members of wuz\u2191b? perform all their signature moves. You can also have the dancers perform in any way you like which you can record and repay for your friends. </p>\n<p>Three different musical styles are represented: jazz, hip hop, and rock. The game makes each of these modes unique, not just by changing musical tone but, by having the player change the way he holds the WonderSwan for each genre.</p>\n<p>The forms are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hip hop: the screen is held in the normal horizontal position so that the left hand can hit the A+B buttons and right hand can press the basic directional keys.</li>\n<li>Lockin' [sic]: In the mode the system is held so that both hands can press the directional buttons.This mode also requires you to press two notes at a time usually matching directions on both sets of directional buttons.</li>\n<li>Jazz: This is a total reversal of the hip hop mode. The system will now be horizontal but essentially upside down. Now the directional keys and A+B buttons will be at the top of the console.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A multiplayer mode is also included for two people on one system. Both players take one set of the WonderSwans directional buttons and both players select different dancers. The multiplayer mode takes place in the vertical \"lockin'\" style, with two columns of press commands scrolling on the right. Both players are instructed by one of the columns, the player that is doing better will have their chosen dancer displayed on the screen.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Wonder Stadium</em>, not to be confused with the nearly identical <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/36450/wonder-stadium-99/\">Wonder Stadium '99</a>, presents a monochrome baseball experience for the WonderSwan. Players will quickly be able to start playing as one of fourteen teams, twelve professional two fictional, in All-Star Duel, Exhibition Game, or Homerun Competition modes. Players can also personalize their teams by giving the generic characters who comprise the teams names. </p>\n<p>When starting a game you'll be asked to select a team, a stadium; classic, seaside, or space, and how many innings the game will run from 1 to 9.</p>\n<p>Hitting the ball is the 'simple' affair that it usually is, time your swing and if you timed well your ball will fly into or out of the field. <em>Wonder Stadium</em> does give the ability to bunt and tweak the direction that bunt will go. </p>\n<p>While playing the field you'll have considerable command over a number of different pitches. From moving your pitchers subtly around the mound to how hard a throw you'll give. Once your opposing team manages to get a hit the game stops giving you the view from behind the plate and switches to a birds-eye view of the field.</p>\n<p>Each ballplayer is hooked to another for instance when you move your man on first base the fellow in the field behind him will move in the same way, a bit clumsy but an acceptable compromise. The person nearest to the ball will always be under your control. Once you get the ball you may throw it toward a base of your choice.</p>",

This refers to the scratching of a record, one might think that the WonderSwan is ill-equiped for such a for of input, well think again! <em>beatmania for WonderSwan</em> included in its packaging a miniature record that could be fitted over the right directional keys to make scratching more realistic.</p>\n<p>As you finish songs you'll on lock more difficult and interesting(?) tunes.

While Nikoli is widely known for coining the puzzle name <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Sudoku\">Sudoku</a>, they also have produced a myriad of puzzles often dealing with numbers. </p>\n<p>In this puzzle the player needs to create a loop around the fields grid without having the loop's line cross itself. This would of course present little challenge if it weren't for those pesky numbers. The field is dotted with numerals that signal how many times the line may be next to it. The number one may only have the line contiguous with it on one side, the two two sides, the three three sides. Four of course does not exist as that would, by a requirement to have four sides, create a square and thus a intersection of the line. Zeros also exist these may not have any lines bordering them at all. </p>\n<p>When a loop has been created so that all numbers are 'touched' appropriately and the line make a full loop you've cleared the puzzle. The game possesses six levels of difficulty and is played vertically on the WonderSwan.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Ganso Jajamaru-kun</em> is a remake of the NES platformer <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/37993/ninja-jajamaru-kun/\">Ninja Jajamaru-kun</a>. It includes new levels and bosses that stretch the gameplay in novel ways.</p>\n<p>Lord Namazu Dayuu has kidnapped Jajamaru-kun's beloved Princess Sakura. This piratical lord is no laughing matter, despite his sadistically gleeful disposition, he possess an army of creatures drawn from Japanese folklore to prevent you from reuniting with your princess ever again.</p>\n<p>The game is quite simple and plays, for the most part, much like its predecessor. Jajamaru-kun begins on the bottom of a three tiered horizontal field. On each level of this field there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick points in that Jajamaru-kun can break by hitting them with his head while, a common trait for arcade heroes. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear a level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned either by falling through a hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. Being touched by an enemy projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for extra points.</p>\n<p>Each of these stages has a leader who will posses some special attribute and present a new sprite. After the level in which the leader appears he/she/it will show up in the following levels as a standard level enemy often a bit weaker. Each stage gives you two minutes to complete it, except bosses and special stages. When about one minute remains Lord Namazu will send an orb of fire onto the stage that will slowly home after Jajamaru-kun.</p>\n<p>You start the game with two extra lives and three continues. More lives can be found in the game, or by accruing points. </p>\n<p>There are four levels in each game area, village, graveyard, castle and town, seaside and ship, and the hidden island. However it is not enough to kill all the enemies in a stage to progress to the next area. Each level has its a cherry blossom that will descend from the top of the screen at a certain point. If you should kill all the enemies before the blossom arrives or the blossom floats of the bottom of the screen you'll go onto the next level but have to return to get it later, in this case all the enemies will have returned. Collecting all four cherry blossoms will allow you to go onto a special stage and the area boss.</p>\n<p>Each game area has one special stage. These stages use the familiar tiers but now they scroll upwards and are littered with traps and hazards; such as, wheels of fire, falling logs, spikes, conveyor belts, etc.. As the scrolling is automatic should Jajamaru-kun not keep up and fall off the bottom of the screen he will die, touching any deadly hazard will also dispatch our hero. Should the player reach the top of the tiers he will be confronted with a gate that his shuriken will open, this leads to a boss.</p>\n<p>Each area boss is attacked in a unique boxed in area, sometimes with platforms. The final boss is the only area where Jajamaru-kun may throw his shuriken vertically. There are no power-ups in boss rooms.</p>\n<p>The power-ups that can be found in the bricks between tiers wear out after a certain amount of time, with the exception of the frog. They will appear on the upper right hand corner of the screen so you know which ones you've picked up recently, getting the frog clears this list.<em> </em>Invisibility potion*: an invisible ninja is an unstoppable ninja. Once a ninja takes the potion you'll become an ninja outline and can go through enemies. Nothing can harm you, but that doesn't limit your ability to dispatch foes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Ninja Cart</em>: this is a small velocoped for ninja, one in this cart you'll be able to kill enemies by barreling into them, even though it doesn't make physical sense you can still jump in this cart.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Big Shuriken</em>: this will make your ninja stars about as big as you are, easily defeating evasive enemies</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Long Distance</em>: this weapon upgrade will make your attacks go across the entire screen.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Katana</em>: a fearsome sword, the katana can do away with any foe, regardless of if they have armor or are to low to hit with your normal attack. The katana also destroys incoming projectiles, however, this blade has a very limited range so be careful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Boomerang</em>: causes your shuriken to fly back at you, it wont harm you, but it is great for picking off foes that are weak from behind.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Speed increase</em>: this spherical power-up increases Jajamaru-kun speed to the the peril of his enemies, and himself.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Watch</em>: this item will give you more time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Extra Ninja</em>: this item will grant you an extra life, very rare! They do not count as a collected item.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Inscribed Coin</em>: these coins available in white and black are worth varying amounts of points. They do not count as a collected item.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Bombs</em>: these items look like two speed boost orbs, or the wheels of the cart, however, they are a trap. Jumping into these means instant death for Jajamaru-kun</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Trusty Frog</em>: Jajamaru-kun's noble steed, a humongous man-eating frog. Should you collect four power-ups instead of receiving the power of the fourth you will get to ride on your gigantic frog and eat all the enemies on the stage. This can be dangerous though if you have not yet gotten the stages petal as once on the frog it won't show up. There is no time limit on how long the frog stays, unless of course the time runs out entirely before you gobble up all the enemies. Once a stage ends you will have to repeat the item collection process to ride the frog again. Items in your collection carry over between stages so you can strategically pick a fourth on a stage where you need the frog.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

By fusing the best of animal and mechanical traits they create three bestial androids from a bird, a lion, and a rhinoceros. Bets are taken and then the robots are loosed into hostile mazes of scrap metal on old earth. Maybe they'll even make it back alive...</p>\n<p>The goal of <em>BUFFERS EVOLUTION</em> is to run through a course while collecting ten parts in the best time possible. The courses are large and vary between jungle scenes, deserts, old factories, and general mechanical wastes. These areas are cased in by electricity to stop the contests from escaping and thereby ruining the entertainment of the masses. This will keep you in the bounds of the course. With the press of a button your character will momentarily turn into a 'buffer', a sharp pisiform metallic object, while being a buffer you can destroy enemies by slamming into them, this will often bounce you in a given direction, which is useful for reaching high ledges. </p>\n<p>Although you do not need to get all the parts to clear an area special items can be accrued by collection parts, while on the course proper these parts will heal any damage you may have taken. Perhaps if you collect all the part in all nine areas you'll have the means to escape your captors? </p>\n<p>Gameplay is reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Sonic+the+Hedghog\">Sonic the Hedghog</a>\n although in those games you race against a countdown while here you are merely trying to get good times.</p>",

Depending on how high the bar is when you stop it correlates to how far your line goes. Bigger fish lurk farther out; however, bigger fish are more difficult to real in given their distance from shore.</p>\n<p>Once your hook is in the water you will be treated to a [fisheye?] view of it in the brine. The background water is represented in different gradients so that the player can tell if they are moving up and down. A meter on the right hand side of the screen shows how deep you are, the farther you cast the deeper you'll be. </p>\n<p>By pulling the line up with fish will be attracted to the hook. Should one grab on you'll get a \"HIT\". The view will now revert to being behind the fisher. Based on indications from a bar on the bottom you will have to push left and right, based on how the fish is trying to escape while pressing A. </p>\n<p>Once caught you'll learn how big your fish was and be able to exchange data about it with other WonderSwan players.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Fighting games are generally interested in making a player hit a complex mash of buttons to perform pugilistic wonders. This game is however card based, how can that work? During a battle between two opponents a set of five moves will appear on a roulette. The player hits a button to stop the rotation of the selector to semi-randomly select a field. A higher number card will always cancels out a lower number card. Higher number cards also do more damage. Block cards and counter cards also exist.</p>\n<p>A number of different attacks are available: combo cards pile up, allowing multiple cards to be selected until a combo card is reselected or a non-combo card is selected; juggling cards which allow for classic fighting game mechanics by allowing another attack after the first; charge cards allow the player to wait a turn to do extra damage should the player use an attack the next turn.</p>\n<p>All cards have different visuals, and oft times different names, for different characters. </p>\n<p>There are several game modes: a classic arcade battle where the player selects a character and a computer controlled character to face; an adventure mode where the player finds new cards and unlocks new character by defeating them; and a multiplayer vs. match for WonderSwan wielding humans.</p>\n<p>The story mode plays on a 15x15 grid map covered with shrines, villages, and impassible mountains. You will only have a certain number of steps to make it to stage exit or you'll lose. Of course this Harshadic field is populated with a grave propensity of villains. Roving in the dark, for all the area of the world is obscured by 'fog' until the player walks there, are mysterious stormtroopers called Crow, Owl, Eagle. Also wandering the land are <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tekken\">Tekken</a> characters who hold long standing grudges against the player's character. Above it all in a high tower is the heinous Ogre, can he be defeated? </p>\n<p>Along the way cards can be found that will increase the amount of moves that can be performed in combat. Sacred ziggurats exist, two per map, that will heal wounds and, if enough enemies have been defeated since the last shrine, a new form of attack card be obtained. These shrines may not be reentered. </p>\n<p>Players may fight their friends or foes using the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Communication+Cable\">Communication Cable</a> to connect two WonderSwans for a fight.</p>",

The players chibi avatar stands by the tee club aloft whilst a 'power bar' fluctuates up and down beside it. When the player presses a button the power bars movements will stop and how height the bar was will effect the distance of the shot. Before this the player may of course state the direction they'd like to hit the ball and where on it's surface they would like to strike it. Hazards are or course a threat to the novice, such as sand traps, meddlesome trees, etc. The flight of the ball is shown in an overhead view.</p>\n<p>Once the ball is on the putting green the view remains over head regardless if the ball is in motion or being struck. The player may here select the direction of the strike to the ball, and the power bar will recommence it's spasms; however, the golfer ball will move of its own accord without any golfer in sight. The putting green is covered by marks that indicate the subtle slopping of the ground that seeks to keep you away from your triple bogey. </p>\n<p>Should you find endlessly teeing off with yourself a bit tedious you may use the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Communication+Cable\">Communication Cable</a> to play with another human, or you may challenge the npc character. This veritable samurai of the rough, swarthily attired in a fly fishing hat, will critique your game as he putts against you.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The raven has made a friend. But sorrow be to this raven, for this fellow avian migrates, and will not return for seasons. Filled with sadness and regret the raven takes wing. As he soars through his lonely world his tears begin to fall... and water dying flowers. At last he knows what he must do until his friend returns, he will make new friends in the flowers. He will help them grow and spread their seeds. </p>\n<p>Each level in <em>Tane o Maku Tori</em> contains four pillars bridged by a series of horizontal or vertical rows. These rows are different for each of the three spaces formed by the pillar. The rows may be moved up and down, one set at a time. At the foot of a column, up to three in harder areas, will be a nascent flower. Water drops will fall along the path of the pillars, which will have a different theme for each level, and eventually either fall onto the ground or a flower. Water drops will always move along a bridge if it intersects their path, drops can't go up diagonals. Drops an combine to create larger faster moving drops. Any more than three drops and it will simply fall off the pillar, or bridge, and be of no use.</p>\n<p>When a flower gets enough rain drops, or tear drops, it will bloom, when all the flowers on the stage bloom it will be cleared. </p>\n<p>Enemies also roam the stage, gobbling up hydrogen based solution and plants. They follow the same laws as the drops and will move along beams when encountered, however they can go up vertical beams. Should one reach a flower it will nibble at it until dead. This ends the game; however, enemies can be destroyed by three drops combined. </p>\n<p>A time mode is available where the player picks a difficulty level and then plays on the level until a flower is eaten or they run out of time, each completed flower will add to the time. </p>\n<p>A two player mode is available through the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Communication+Cable\">Communication Cable</a></p>\n<p>This game is played vertically.</p>",

Shin'ichi Kudo, an inquisitive seventeen year old student, was investigating a blackmail case when attacked by members of the Black Organization. He was forced to take an experimental APTX 4869 drug which caused, in a rare side-effect, his body to transform into that of a seven-year-old. </p>\n<p>This does not stop Shin'ichi, adopting the name Conan Edogawa he moves in with Ran M\u014dri, his childhood friend and sweetheart. Enrolling in a elementary school to complete his disguise he vows to find out who is backing the Black Organization, and to have his revenge. With the help of his his oddball classmates, an ex-member of the Black Organization Ai Haibara, whose also been turned into a child, and his beloved he just might do it...</p>\n<p>The games story follows the Conan through his school life which intertwines with his search for justice. He forms a Junior Detective League in his school to help him out. This cast of characters will help supply you information throughout the game.</p>\n<p>The gameplay consists of using a map screen to travel to a number of areas collecting clues for the case you are on. Each area offers you the ability to examine the area, talk to bystanders, collect items, and sometimes attack if a threat is apparent. </p>\n<p>After collecting information you will have the chance to open your notebook, which will cause the WonderSwan to switch to a vertical orientation, and review your information. Also in the note books is a logic grid. On the grid you will have to select where you've deduced something intersects,who was at the scene at what time, by marking it with a circle and voiding all impossibilities with crosses. Once you've completed an entire grid you'll be able to present your deductions or press a point further allowing you to progress. If you've gotten your reasoning wrong, however, it is back to the drawing board and time to recheck you evidence and maybe time to see if you missed some clues.</p>\n<p>This game includes five scenarios, roughly translated to English as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continuous high school girl kidnapping</li>\n<li>Murder on the suspense drama set</li>\n<li>Jack the Ripper murder</li>\n<li>The mysteries incident's letter of notice</li>\n<li>Treasure cases at the end of the century</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p>A spin-off of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Rainbow+Islands\">Rainbow Islands</a> games, this title features Putty instead of the classic Bub &amp; Bob. Like the previous games set on the island the character's main tools and weapons are rainbows. These rainbows can be walked on to scale heights or cover gaps. Rainbows can also be used to kill enemies by striking them with the arc as it is created, or after it has taken form jumping on it so that it breaks and the shards rain death on those below. Enemies can also be trapped in rainbows. Enemies killed by rainbow shards will sometimes drop a special item or a gem. A series of gems are needed to properly clear each level.</p>\n<p>The goal of each area, aside from collecting gems, is to scale to the top of the island. Islands are made out of a series of themed platforms covered with associated enemies. These areas are scattered with items, mostly food, that will increase your score. Sometimes a rainbow will dislodge hidden food or an enemy will drop some when killed. If your score is high enough you will start to send out more than one rainbow at a time. At the end of each island there will be a boss. If you fulfilled certain requirements in the level you may get a special item.</p>\n<p>The islands in this game are, here listed with their theme:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Insect Island</strong>: Insects and nature</li>\n<li><strong>Monster Island</strong>: Classic horror monsters</li>\n<li><strong>Doh Island</strong>: Geometric</li>\n<li><strong>Darius Island</strong>: Machines</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This game plays vertically.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Mingle Magnet</em> is a simple puzzle game of the falling block variety. The player oversees a 10 x 10 square field where the first four rows (three on easy) have been filled by blocks. Each block shows one of three symbols, a dark gray circle, a light gray circle, and a white circle. When ever any of blocks with matching symbols touch they will form a link. By moving the cursor over a chain and clicking on it the player will be given points based on its size on the chain will be removed. The goal is to get a large score while making sure that new pieces can still enter the field. Once no more pieces can enter the game ends. Blocks fall at the same time one square apart, when the next set of blocks fall they will occupy the space given by the previous drop.</p>\n<p>The \"magnet\" aspect of <em>Mingle Magnet</em> come into play in how the player can control the placement of the blocks. All the blocks are attracted to a magnet which, although not seen, can be placed on any side of the field. All blocks will be drawn to the magnet. For example, if one has the magnet at the south of the field and then puts it to the north what was the top of the block pile will now be the bottom, and blocks will fall onto what was the bottom. The direction of the magnet is indicated by a magnetic field animation behind the action.</p>\n<p>This game is played vertically.</p>",

A power meter sways over head and should the play manage to stop the meter at just the right point he will be rewarded with his cast going closer to where he intended. Once in the water the player's lure will always be in the center of the screen.</p>\n<p>Catching fish is no easy matter as the PlayStation version frequently points out; it is all about finesse. The player will have to entice the fish with wiggles and jolts from the lure... this is of course assuming that the player has selected the right lure. Once a fish is caught a small screen will pop up within the screen, showing a close up of the fish's shadow on the surface of the water. The player will get a chance to see if he hooked something good should the fish jump, as they reel it in.</p>\n<p>Records can be shared by means of the Communication Cable.</p>",

This game combines enemies from all three previous <em>Ghosts 'N Goblins</em> games.</p>\n<p>Arthur can walk left and right, jump, and he is equipped with a lance to use as a weapon. Getting hit by enemies causes Arthur to lose his armor and run around in his underpants. Getting hit again will cause the player to lose a life. As in most games in this genre, Arthur can pick up power-ups such as daggers and bombs during the course of the game, proving greater firepower.</p>",

In the story mode the player starts by selecting an armored unit out of several available which vary in type (i.e. knight, ranger, seeker), weapons, and basic stats such as health and energy, after which one progresses through a series of stages backed up by a short dialogue cut-scenes between the stages.</p>\n<p>The basic movement occurs on a square map field where you can move your armored unit horizontally or vertically. You fight an opponent which is a hidden armored unit, visible only when you are adjacent to it or if you have a radar that can uncover it within a certain radius. Armed with weapons and special attacks based on the type of unit you have selected your goal is to defeat the enemy unit and progress to the next stage. You can fight at random map fields or use weapons of mass destruction to try and hit enemy unit without knowing where exactly it is located. After each stage, you are able to upgrade and edit your current weapon arsenal, or add new weapons and gadgets.</p>",

        "description": "<p>After the One Year War (Mobile Suit Gundam), the Earth has returned to a state of partial peace. Following this, the Earth Federation decided to downsize the army. However, insidious forces both inside and outside our world are awakening, and the flames of war are fanning again. Under the name of hunting down the remnants of Zeon forces, Earth Federation forms the Titans, a special military group. Meanwhile, Zeon reforms itself into Neo Zeon (Zeta Gundam), on a mining asteroid known as Axis. On Earth, the former forces of Dr. Hell (Mazinger Z), as well as the Dinosaur Empire (Getter Robo) begin to rampage. From outer space, the Vega Empire initiates an invasion. Only the very few remaining battalions band together to combat these new threats, both on Earth or in its orbit. Nobody knew, however, that these events were a prelude to a conflict that would encompass the entire galaxy.</p>\n<p>The second game in the Compact series for the WonderSwan, <em>Super Robot Wars/Taisen Compact 2</em> is known for its very large scenario. The game is divided into three parts, each released separately. This particular part deals with the conflict on Earth and follows the story of Ky\u014dsuke Nambu, the pilot of the Super Robot \"Alt Eisen / Alteisen\". The game supports the use of the WonderSwan's internal memory to write a \"game cleared\" file, that can be used to transfer data from one part to the next. Doing so, players can expect additional features and bonuses. However, it is entirely possible to start playing all parts even without transferring the save data altogether.</p>\n<p>In terms of new gameplay mechanics, <em>Compact 2</em> introduces support attacks and support defenses into franchise. Basically, when friendly units are adjacent to each other, the pilots can defend the unit or attack alongside the unit, depending on the order the player gives. Support abilities depends largely on the skill of the pilot in question. Skills can be customized after each mission and can replace existing ones, should the player choose so.</p>",
