As the hero of the game, you lead a growing army of troops as you progress through the game in a series of pivotal battles. Before each battle you are given the option to setup your army into distinct groups. Then you are given a mission on the map and you can then set your army out to do your bidding. As your unit groups travel along the map on the way to their given objective, they'll happen along enemy unit groups. When they meet, the game switches to an isometric view of the automated turn-based battle that ensues.</p>",

Town navigation is menu-driven and all graphics are now top-down 2D sprites, with all dungeons being pre-designed instead of randomly generated. Combat is turn-based using a menu system from which you select your actions for each party member (up to 3) and execute them, but otherwise remains unchanged.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In this game you keep watch on the wacky Neo Poke-kun, a cartoony programmer thing that lives locked in his small Tokyo apartment. You don't have direct control of his actions but instead interact with him indirectly by switching stuff in his apartment on and off, which triggers different reactions from him. More importantly you can invite different characters to visit Neo Poke-kun, which will also trigger different reactions from him. Depending on the time of day and the visitor you may get different reactions from Poke-kun, and if you make him happy enough he'll get to work and code a mini-game for you.</p>\n<p>These collection of 30 games form the bulk of the gameplay, and include different clones of other games, shooters, short platformers, and compact puzzle challenges similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Wario+Ware\">Wario Ware</a>.</p>\n<p>The game has a distinctly bizarre sense of humor with wacky animations played whenever something happens to your Poke-kun, and while some games use basic vector graphics, most use 2D sprites.</p>",

While you paint, two enemies walk around in the maze, when they hit you, you lose a life.</p>\n<p>A level has rollers which you can push forward with your paint brush. If you capture an enemy in the path of the roller he dies and is temporarily taken out of the game. This scores you extra points. Each subsequent enemy rolled over is worth more points.</p>\n<p>Every once in a while another creature will pop up, it will run around leaving behind track marks in your paint. Painting over this creature removes it from the game and scores you additional points. His tracks have to be repainted.</p>\n<p>When the entire maze is painted you win the level. Unlike the original arcade version the Neo Geo Pocket Color version has multiple levels.</p>",

There is another version of Dive Alert called <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/157820/dive-alert-matts-version/\">Dive Alert: Matt's Version</a>. The two games are rather like joint <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pokemon\">Pokemon</a> releases (Red/Blue, etc) wherein they are overall the same game with a variety of smaller differences.</p>\n<p>The player takes control of a character named Becky. The game takes place in the future and the world is primarily surrounded by water. The only land is a small patch called Terra. The player must prove their worth to be accepted on to Terra by proving their skill as a submarine commander and destroying enemy vessels.</p>\n<p>Becky's version features different characters, items and boats from Matt's Version. These are logged in a device similar to a Pok\u00e9dex (from Pokemon). Battles take place against enemy ships and a radar view is used to help the player guide torpedoes towards the enemy vessels. Much of the game is text-based with animated cutscenes. </p>\n<p>The game features the ability for two players to link up Neo Geo Pocket Color units to exchanges ships and data, and to battle one on one. The game also features battery back-up and a training mode.</p>",

The shots form a line where they impact. If that line connects otherwise unconnected blocks of the same color they will dissolve.</p>\n<p>There are new modes in Puzzle Link 2. Like the original, there are the standard challenge and puzzle rounds. But new to the series is the marathon-style game where you continue eliminating pieces as the game gradually increases speed. In this mode, more power-ups appear as the player performs faster. Here, you get three shots that will eliminate the same color tile from the board.

As usual, you play strip mahjong with pretty girls, this time several from many of the games. However, due to the system's limitations, only a few strip scenes are animated. It also has some visual novel-like qualities, particularly a story mode where you try to focus on one girl each time it is played. This is accomplished by choosing the right options when they are presented to you. If you succeed in focusing on only one girl, her CG is then unlocked in the gallery.</p>",

It offers a selection of modes and levels seen in earlier entries.</p>\n<p>The game includes three different game modes. Puzzle mode consists of 99 puzzles, taken from various earlier entries in the series for a \"best of\". The first ten levels can be selected from the start, and the best clearing times are saved per level. VS mode is the competitive variant of the game, played in best-of-three matches either against one of several different CPU opponents (with different strategies) or against another player via link connection. Survivor mode is an endless mode played for high score.</p>\n<p>Gameplay follows the standard model: the player controls a cannon at the bottom of the play field that shoots randomly colored bubbles. When three or more bubbles of the same color touch, they are removed from the field. In puzzle mode, the ceiling moves downward after a while, while in the other modes, additional bubbles are added from the top. In survivor mode only, bubbles also are added from the bottom sometimes. The game is lost once the bubbles reach the bottom. Popping more than three bubbles at a time moves extra bubbles to the opponent's field in VS mode.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The goal of <em>Delta Warp</em> is to gather all the 'Delta Power units' in each stage as quickly as possible. To do this, you must navigate your 'Delta' around the stage, changing its colour between white and black to match the colour of the Delta Power unit. Moving across the stage with the joystick will cause the Delta's colour to alternate with each space. However, pressing A or B will rotate the player-unit around the diamond patterns that make up the stage without the colour changing. The complexity of the levels gradually increases with the introduction of new mechanics such as multi-floor stages and special tiles that change the properties of the Delta.</p>\n<p>In addition to the game's one hundred original stages, it also features a level editor which allows you to create your own stages and trade them with others. A two-player 'Battle' mode is also available through the link cable.</p>",

In single-player, you must make your way through Tournament Mode, competing against eight progressively difficult opponents. You can also take the 'Ability Level Test' which grades you based on your play. For beginners, 'Reversi Lesson' provides ten short tutorial sessions to teach you the basics of the game. There's also a 'Free Play' mode where you can choose to see all available moves and to even take back your last move. Finally, there's a two-player mode accessible via the link cable.</p>",

These are logged in a device similar to a Pok\u00e9dex (from Pokemon). Battles take place against enemy ships and a radar view is used to help the player guide torpedoes towards the enemy vessels. Much of the game is text-based with animated cutscenes. </p>\n<p>The game features the ability for two players to link up Neo Geo Pocket Color units to exchanges ships and data, and to battle one on one.

After passing the exam and obtaining a license, players can accept various tasks which will reward them with money and Worker points.</p>\n<p>The worker points serve both as the game's reputation system and are an integral part of the game's license system. They determine who would accept to be a part of the player's party, as well as allow players to get new licenses, which works in a similar way to Final Fantasy's job system. Equipping different licenses will unlock different spells for players to use in battle. The more worker points players get, the more likely it is that additional characters can be hired.</p>",
