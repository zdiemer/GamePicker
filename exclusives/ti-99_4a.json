        "description": "<p>A mythical creature called a Wumpus is sleeping somewhere in a series of maze-like caves, and your goal is to hunt it down. The cave is dangerous, and in addition to the Wumpus there are bottomless pits and cave bats. Walking into a pit ends the game, encountering a bat will cause you to be relocated to a random location in the cave (which may or may not be safe), and walking into the same room as the Wumpus will cause it to wake up and eat you. To help figure out where these dangers are various cave rooms can provide clues. For example, finding blood splattered in the room means the Wumpus is near, or if you feel a breeze then a pit is near. From these clues you need to deduce the layout of the cave and the location of the Wumpus. If you think you know where the Wumpus is, you have one arrow to fire; a hit wins the game, but a miss means you are eaten by the Wumpus.</p>\n<p><em>Hunt the Wumpus</em> was originally a text based adventure written for mainframes, and this version maintains the same gameplay however graphical enhancements are added. During the game you have a top down view of the cave as you move from room to room with various colors used to indicate the clues. Depending on the difficulty level selected, the map will show you the entire cave that you have visited so far, or only the current room you are standing in. You may also select from several cave difficulty levels (this affects the complexity of the cave layout). When the game ends, you can optionally view the entire cave to see how close (or far) you came to winning.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Alpiner</em> is a third-person action game in which the player's goal is to climb safely to the top of various mountains. Each of the six mountains the player climbs has various obstacles which should be avoided: falling rocks, avalanches, wild animals, trees, and brush fires can all hinder progress. Being hit by these obstacles will cause the player to lose progress, falling down part of the mountain (some obstacles cause a short falling distance, others a long distance). </p>\n<p>Should the player fall all of the way to the bottom of the mountain a life will be lost. To help anticipate obstacles, voice synthesis provide a warning when danger is near. Each mountain has a time limit in which it must be climbed, though the timer only counts down when the climber isn't moving. As the player progresses through the levels the mountains become higher and obstacles become faster and more numerous.</p>",

You control a chef, and your goal is to make burgers! The screen consists of various platforms which contain the ingredients you'll need: buns, burgers, and lettuce. When your chef walks over an ingredient, it will fall to the level below. When all the ingredients in a column fall to the bottom of the screen, you'll have a complete hamburger; complete all of the hamburgers on the screen, and you can move on to the next level. Unlike BurgerTime, the ingredients won't cascade downward; there needs to be an open space below for an ingredient to fall into so you'll have to work your way from the bottom of the screen upwards. Of course, there are enemies (in the forms of burgers, pickles, cheese, and mushrooms) that wander about to make your task more difficult! Each platform has an enemy which wanders back and forth; although they can be crushed by falling ingredients (for bonus points), they will appear again and be faster than before! Your only defense against the various opponents is to avoid them.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Junkman Junior</em> is a clone of the game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/12833/jumpman-junior/\">Jumpman Junior</a>. Your goal is to collect all of the junk on the screen so you can earn points and move on to the next level. There are various platforms, ladders, and ropes you will need to climb and jump your way around to reach the various items. From time to time, a bullet will fire at you from off of the screen; be sure to dodge this, otherwise one of your lives will be lost! Although this is primarily an action game, there is a strategy element to it as well, as you may need to figure out an optimal route to reach all of the items. When an item is collected, often there is a consequence on the screen, such as floors disappearing or deadly fires appearing; if you aren't careful, you could find yourself in a difficult situation! Each level has a different theme, and may also feature additional challenges such as moving ladders and falling firestones. There are eleven levels in total to complete.</p>",

Waves of alien craft swoop down from the top and the player must shoot them down without colliding with them or the ground, running out of fuel, or overheating the ship's laser. Some enemies are harder to destroy and shoot back. At the end of each level, the player must navigate through an asteroid field which can yield many points, but can also result in a loss of ships in the process due to collisions.</p>\n<p>The game takes advantage of the TI's speech synthesizer: a female voice occasionally makes comments such as \"Nice shooting, pilot!\", or \"Asteroid field ahead\" throughout the course of the game.</p>",

The cavern has an extra bit as they add strange live dropping stalactites that follow you once they've landed on the ground. Don't get too caught up shooting, you have to stop shooting to move and the Slymoids are coming from all directions but in front of you.

        "description": "<p><em>Bouncer</em> is a single-screen action game where the player controls a red ball that uses trampolines to jump between different octagon shaped platforms. On each platform there is a square and to complete a level all white squares have to be collected. The game is a bit similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Q*bert\">Q*bert</a> but instead of a isometric perspective the game uses a slightly tilted top-down view. Instead of enemies jumping around the platforms there are a number of arrows that move horizontally across the screen. Any contact with these leads to a life lost.</p>\n<p>The player starts with four lives and an extra one is given upon reaching 3,000 points. Most squares are white but there are also red ones as well as a center dot. White squares are worth ten points while the center dot is initially worth 100 points. However every time the player touches a red square the center dot is reset and its value is increased by 100.</p>",

With the use of four directional keys the player has to shoot down the asteroids before being hit. The second stage is more like a traditional fixed screen shoot 'em up although the player's ship cannot move. Aliens appear in groups of three and move across the screen and the player has to shoot them down before they reach the bottom.</p>\n<p>Finally the player has to navigate his ship through a meteor belt. The ship automatically moves upwards and the player has to steer it left and right to avoid the meteors. Upon reaching the top of the screen a droid will appear to the left or right of the ship. The player has to quickly aim and shoot the droid before it destroys the ship. If the player has any lives left after the third stage he will return to the first stage but will play it on a higher difficulty. The player starts the game with ten lives.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Bigfoot</em>, your ultimate goal is to scale a mountain and capture the eponymous creature, who stands at the summit. Along the way, you collect food and gold. However, in order to collect one bundle of gold (yellow piles), you must first collect one bundle of food (green boxes). Using the fire button, you throw ropes which are used for climbing up the platforms. Once thrown, you can scale up and down the ropes. </p>\n<p>Bigfoot hurls boulders at you as you go. If your rope is near the edge of a platform instead of near the middle, you run the risk of being smashed by a boulder as you climb up the rope, so throwing the rope near the center of a platform is safest. During later levels, birds will come along and snag the ropes - fatal if you happen to be on a snagged rope at the time.</p>",

The game is played on single screen levels, each filled with a random assortment of crates, forming a reconfigurable maze.</p>\n<p>The player plays the role of Hopper, a kangaroo. Hopper is trying to escape from three circus trainers, who move around the screen trying to capture Hopper.</p>\n<p>Hopper can move around in all four directions, and when up against a crate, will push the crates in front of him. The pushed crates slide until they come into contact with another crate, or with the outside walls of the room. This allows Hopper to reconfigure the maze, and to defeat the trainers.</p>\n<p>In order to defeat the trainers, Hopper can either push a crate over them (squashing them), or trap them in a single 1x1 space with crates. In order to advance to the next level, all of the trainers must be defeated.</p>\n<p>The player has four lives. Each time a trainer captures him, one is lost. The game ends when the four lives are gone.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Astromania</em> is a shoot 'em up where the player has to save a number of planets from a group of invaders called Frizoids. Each planet is divided into two stages. The first one takes place above the planet's surface and is viewed from a side view perspective with some scrolling graphics although the player's movement is limited to moving up and down along the left edge of the screen. To complete a stage numerous enemies have to be shot down and, like the player, they can only move up and down along the edge of the screen. Enemies appear one at a time and when one is killed another takes its place. The gameplay is a bit slower than other shooters due to the player having to hold down the button for a brief moment to fire. </p>\n<p>After all aliens above the surface have been eliminated the player has to destroy the aliens' force field generator. The second stage plays similarly to the first one but here the action is viewed from a top down perspective. Instead of moving up and down the player here moves the ship left and right and shoot at the aliens above. Once the generator is destroyed the game moves on to the next planet that needs to be saved. After two planets the player gets to fight the invaders' mother ship which works similarly to the second stage although here it is necessary to hit a specific spot of the ship.</p>",

The player can move in four directions and a single shot is enough to destroy a robot. If a robot picks up a pod and then is shot it will drop the pod on the spot. A level is completed once all robots have been destroyed and pods will return to their original positions in the next level. Pods that have been stolen will not reappear and the game goes on until all pods have been lost.</p>\n<p>The game features a two player mode that is both cooperative and competitive at the same. Like in the single player mode the two players have to defend the pods from the robot attacks but they can also kill each other to get extra points.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Robopods</em> is a single screen game where the earth has been invaded by alien robopods. The player's task is to deactivate the robopods by climbing up between their legs. The robopods are numbered and have to be deactivated in the correct order or else they will explode and the game will end. The player can move around in any direction but the character leaves behind radioactive footprints which the player cannot step on, although occasionally safety mats appear across the track. In addition to the robopods, there are a number of alien land mines on the screen that have to be avoided. Stepping on a mine or the footprints or taking too long of a time will also lead to a game over. There are five skill levels that differ on the number of robopods and mines.</p>",

The number of atoms can be selected before starting with a maximum of ten. To locate the atoms the player has to send rays from the sides of the grid and see if the they are absorbed, reflected or deflected by the atoms. Rays that directly hit the atoms are absorbed while rays that move one box away from an atom are reflected. The rays' path through the grid is not shown so the player has to figure it out based on where they exit the grid. When the player thinks he knows the atoms' positions he can make guesses and will then get a score depending on how many were right.</p>",

In Letter Hop there are five rocks with letters and the player has to press the space bar to move the frog to the rock with the same letter as the one displayed at the top of the screen. For every correct answer another frog will make a hop forward and the game is complete when it has done five hops. Rock Hop shows four lily pads and one rock and the player has to enter the number of hops that are needed to reach the rock. Frog Race can be played by two players and shows a letter at the top of the screen. The first player to type the letter makes one hop forward and the aim is to reach the rock at the left edge of the screen.</p>",

The space lazer is used to shoot down the aliens while the repair craft is used to repair holes in the force field. While the repair craft can move over holes the lazer will fall down and destroy the generator if it attempts to do so. The lazer does however have a thrust that allow it to fly over holes.

While the first game had the munchman laying down a chain throughout the maze, this game is more like a traditional Pac-Man game with the player having to eat all the chains. There are four enemies called hoonos attempting to kill the munchman but by eating an energizer it can for a short while go after and kill them.</p>\n<p>Some new features set the game apart from other Pac-Man games. The maze is made up of two interconnected screens that the player can move between through two doors. To complete a level the chains of both screens have to be eaten.

The game uses pseudo three dimensional graphics to depict streets and buildings. The player controls his officer left and right along a street from a behind view and shoots at the enemies that appear on the side streets. The enemies appear one or two at a time and a single shot is enough to kill them. They do not always die right away and while they are wounded they can still shoot back and kill the player. After being killed an ambulance appears and takes the officer away and another one steps out of the SWAT van to take his place. The player has access to ten officers in total. In addition to the enemy fire there are also bombs being dropped from buildings that can kill the player.</p>",

The abbey has four floors with twenty five rooms on each and the player moves between rooms through doors, secret passages, lifts and stairs. The objective of the game is to find and destroy Dracula and to do so a hidden crucifix must be found and it is also necessary to gain a magic rating of at least 200. The magic rating increases by finding various items such as potions, goblets and wands. The player also has an energy rating which is 100% when starting out and increases with ten points for each room visited. Subsequent visits to the same room will however lead to a loss of five points. If the energy level reaches zero the game will end.</p>\n<p>There are several different creatures that live in the abbey. They include goblins, blobs, ghosts, imps and skeletons. Some of these are hostile and will take away some energy or magic. Others are friendly such as the goblins who are traders that will sell energy or magic in exchange for gold. To be able to open locked doors it is necessary to find a skeleton key. It will however reduce 25 energy points for each door. The same amount will be lost when moving through secret passages.</p>",

As can be expected it is inspired by James Bond books and movies with the player taking the role of the secret agent. An evil computer operator is planning to blow up the world and the player's task is to find his hidden aqua base, backfire his lasers and then escape before everything blows up. It all has to be done within 90 minutes.</p>\n<p>The game works like any text adventure with the player entering compass directions to move around while simple two word verb noun commands such as \"take card\" are used to interact with the world. The game has a built-in hint system which is accessed by typing \"help\".</p>",

To fire the lasers the player enters the altitude (1 to 9) and the area (A to E) followed by pressing the fire button. There are four cities that need to be defended and between them is the laser base that also needs to survive the attack. The missiles will appear in three waves that get increasingly harder.

When one column is full the aliens will start descending, one at a time, and explode upon reaching the bottom of the screen. If the player's ship is within the blast radius it will be destroyed and one of three lives are lost. In addition to the regular aliens, there are also deadly vessels which fall from the ship's side chutes and will kill the player no matter the position. When a certain amount of aliens have been killed the mothership takes off and another harder one will take its place. As it leaves it is possible to shoot its exhaust tube for extra points.</p>",

Once one briefcase has been collected another one appears on the opposite end and to complete the stage six briefcases have to be retrieved. For each run across the train the number of pylons increases. The second stage involve jumping up and down between cable cars. Once again the objective is to retrieve a briefcase.

The game is played on a single screen where the flies buzz around and the player has to shoot them with the can. But there are also other insects invading the screen. Cockroaches run along the floor and needs to be smashed with the can while bees are killed in the same way as the flies but their lethal sting has to be avoided. Each level is completed when ten flies have been killed and it has to be done within a time limit. The amount of spray is also limited but it is recharged after every 1000 points scored.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Blackbeard's Treasure</em> is a single screen action game where the player has to retrieve the lost treasure of Blackbeard the pirate. The treasure is located at the bottom of the sea and to collect it divers have to be sent down. The divers have to be guided from the boat at the top of the screen to the treasure at the bottom and then back up again. The problem is that the water is full of sharks and two giant octopuses are guarding the treasure. Any contact with these and one of the five divers is lost. Up to three treasures can be carried at a time and after ten have been retrieved the level increases. After twenty treasures an extra diver is given.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Moon Mine</em> is a shoot' em up where the player is the captain of the U.S.S. Recovery and has to capture treasure that has been stolen from Earth. The culprit is the evil Zygonaut who has hidden the treasures in a mine shaft in the centre of the moon. As the player descends down the mine shaft ten different creatures will appear that have to be destroyed. This is done with four lasers, one on each side of the screen. The creatures appear far down the shaft and move towards the player's guns. More points are earned by shooting them at a far distance.</p>\n<p>Firing the lasers too much will lead to them overheating. They are cooled with water and at times it is necessary to replenish the water supply. Pools of water occasionally appear on the screen and the player then has to send out a crew member to retrieve it. The crew member can destroy monsters with a hand laser but it only has twelve shots. At times treasure (silver, jade and amethyst) will appear and it is collected in the same way.</p>",

Tokens always drop to the bottom most available spot of a column. The goal is to get four tokens of the same color in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The first to do so wins the game. The game can be played against another player or the computer.</p>\n<p>Two other game modes are included. In Drop Out allows you to remove a token from the bottom row instead of inserting a new token. Wild Spot has one double color token in the playing field from the start at a random location. Both players can use it to get four in a row.</p>",
