        "description": "<p><em>Tycoon</em> is a simulation of a stock exchange for two to four players. Players buy and sell shares and the aim of the game is simply to earn the most money. The game is turn-based and for each turn a player can make up to four transactions. At the start each player has \u00a3100 that can be used to buy shares in six different companies. The year is divided into two periods and at the end of each period the prices will be revalued based on the demand created. When a year ends a dividend will be paid on all shares held. At certain times the game will be interrupted by a news flash which might affect the share prices, dividends or a player's cash assets. The game ends when a player reaches a predetermined target amount.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Takara B.D. Adventure</em> is one of the earliest Japanese full-scale text adventure games with pictures, the first being <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/143930/mystery-house/\">Mystery House</a>. The objective of the game is to find the secret tape and safely deliver it to Micro Cabin on the 5th floor of the Takara Building. There are also various hazards that will kill the player's character if not careful enough.</p>\n<p>There are no room descriptions and the text commands are in very simple English.</p>\n<p>This program has two parts, recorded on two cassettes that were sold separately. Part 1 is set in the passage on the first floor of the building and the purpose is to get on the elevator of the same building, and part 2 is after getting off the elevator.</p>\n<p>You can only play part two after you have finished part one.</p>",

The first one called \"Meiro Yashiki\" has you going around the maze searching for Arale, Senbei, Akane, Taro, Gatchan, and Peasuke then returning back to Time-Kun and get a bonus but if you run into King Nikochan or run out of time then the game is over. The second game mode called \"Maze Land\" has you going around in the maze saving your girlfriend while shooting at spiders that are keeping her hostage with your laser gun. Once you get her you have to get back to the beginning to get a bonus before the time runs out because the spiders will go through parts of the maze in an attempt to stop you from getting out and you have limited ammo, you also have three lives and if you get caught, run out of time, or shoot your girlfriend then you'll lose a life, and once all of them are gone then it's game over.</p>",

Get to the end to meet up at the distance of the train.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In part 2 you need to lower yourself down with the rope to the back of the train while avoiding tunnels that will knock you out, the helicopter gets destroyed and takes one life away from you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once you've successfully board the train, part 3 begins.
