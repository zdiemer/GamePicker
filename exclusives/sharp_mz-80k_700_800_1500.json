        "description": "<p><em>Tycoon</em> is a simulation of a stock exchange for two to four players. Players buy and sell shares and the aim of the game is simply to earn the most money. The game is turn-based and for each turn a player can make up to four transactions. At the start each player has \u00a3100 that can be used to buy shares in six different companies. The year is divided into two periods and at the end of each period the prices will be revalued based on the demand created. When a year ends a dividend will be paid on all shares held. At certain times the game will be interrupted by a news flash which might affect the share prices, dividends or a player's cash assets. The game ends when a player reaches a predetermined target amount.</p>",

The first one called \"Meiro Yashiki\" has you going around the maze searching for Arale, Senbei, Akane, Taro, Gatchan, and Peasuke then returning back to Time-Kun and get a bonus but if you run into King Nikochan or run out of time then the game is over. The second game mode called \"Maze Land\" has you going around in the maze saving your girlfriend while shooting at spiders that are keeping her hostage with your laser gun. Once you get her you have to get back to the beginning to get a bonus before the time runs out because the spiders will go through parts of the maze in an attempt to stop you from getting out and you have limited ammo, you also have three lives and if you get caught, run out of time, or shoot your girlfriend then you'll lose a life, and once all of them are gone then it's game over.</p>",

Get to the end to meet up at the distance of the train.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In part 2 you need to lower yourself down with the rope to the back of the train while avoiding tunnels that will knock you out, the helicopter gets destroyed and takes one life away from you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once you've successfully board the train, part 3 begins.

        "description": "<p><em>Building Hopper</em> is an action game in which you take control of the main character, Hopper. The object of the game is to use ladders and trampolines to reach the top of a 120m-tall building without getting hit by enemies and falling objects like dumbbells and billboards. The task must be done in a certain time limit. The enemies can be defeated by jumping on their heads, or make contact with them while jumping on a trampoline. When you press the \"1, 3\" key at the moment you bounce on the trampoline, you will make a short jump in that direction. (You can also jump in the opposite direction of your initial jump.) If you don't press any keys when you bounce on the trampoline, you will jump a certain height. Also, if you fall from a high place, the trampoline will bounce you for a distance greater than the distance you fell.</p>\n<p>One player will be lost under the following conditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Come into contact with enemy characters Poop (green), Hipgnos (red tentacles), Gegozl (yellow).</li>\n<li>Come into contact with the flames spit by Poop (green enemy).</li>\n<li>Come into contact with falling dumbbells or signboard.</li>\n<li>Come into contact with the blast of dynamite.</li>\n<li>Time reaches 0.</li>\n</ul>",
