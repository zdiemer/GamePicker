        "description": "<p><em>The Intruder</em> is the first episode in a four-part series based on the <em>Jurassic Park</em> franchise that started with a first movie in 1993. The game takes place both concurrently and after during the events of the first movie, but has none of the original characters or cast. It is set on Isla Nublar, the original island where the Jurassic Park with living dinosaurs is established. The story starts with different scenes that introduce the characters in a mixed-up chronology. It has Gerry Harding, the chief veterinarian of the park who shows his daughter Jess around. There is also Miles Chadwick and the professional smuggler Nima Cruz, two contacts sent by Dennis Nedry (from the original movie) who has a plan to shut down the park and run off with dinosaur embryos. But when the park's security systems go down and the dinosaurs roam freely, their plans are foiled. This first episode focuses largely on Nima Cruz as she investigates what happened to Nedry, tries to escape, and is bitten by a strange dinosaur. As Gerry and Jess make their way to the port, they come across Nima who is unconscious and they take her along to reach the visitor center and escape from a giant T-Rex. There they learn that the original cast has already left the island. From then on the three band together and the player controls Gerry as he tries to find a way off the island.</p>\n<p>The game is largely presented as an interactive movie. It consists of different animated scenes with visual clues where the player can interact, similar to the controls in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/45449/heavy-rain/\">Heavy Rain</a>. These are used to manipulate items, examine objects in the environments, choose topics for conversations, but also include many quick time events where the player has to react quickly or perform quick actions such as centering a dot to steady someone's mind or adjusting the frequency of a radio. If a sequence is successfully performed, the story continues until another opportunity to interact arises. There is no complete freedom of movement, instead it consists of a series of linked scenes. There are however opportunities where players can observe the environment in any direction (to find the location of new clues or hot spots) and often there is a choice between different locations to go to. Unlike earlier Telltale games players can die if a sequence is not performed successfully. The game then automatically restarts at an earlier checkpoint to retry. This is can be done an unlimited amount of times. As expected there are many encounters with dinosaurs, in fighting or escape sequences.</p>",

On his desk, lies a fantastic book: a bestiary populated by impossible, finely drawn animals. Not unlike all the monsters of myths and folklores, Gua-Le-Ni\u2019s impossible beasts are combinations of parts of real animals. To understand what I mean, it might help to think of fantastic creatures like the sphinx, the Minotaur, different chimeras or even South Park\u2019s Manbearpig.</p>\n<p>Such animal parts can vary from two to four animal parts. Each animal part, either a head or a body part, is reproduced on a taxonomic cube that can be rotated, flipped and moved until it matches the corresponding part of the passing animal. The goal of the game is precisely that of reconstructing the animals before they reach the end of the page-screen and disappear. When a match between the paper beast and the beast represented on the upper faces of the taxonomic cubes is accomplished, points are scored. </p>\n<p>Different game modes are present in the game's fantastic bestiary, some of which are purely focusing on mnemonic tasks, on action mechanics such as feeding and optimized manipulation of the taxonomic cubes.</p>",

The focus is not to shoot enemies, instead the player is attempting to pollinate flowers. Players gather pollen by hovering their bee over a flower and then deliver that pollen to another flower of the same color to score 100 points. Shooting enemies makes progress easier, but does not contribute directly to the score. </p>\n<p>The game also features a bomb function which converts nearby enemy bullets into honey. This honey damages enemies and each droplet is collected for 1 point. Careful use of the honey bomb can create long chains of honey as more bullets stick to the existing honey droplets. The game features a boss battle against a large dragonfly enemy, after which it begins again but at a harder difficulty and with more flower colors.</p>",

At the end of the level a score is given. For accurate and successful shots, more points are awarded. The performance is also rated by stars (from 1 to 3). The title screen shows the main game modes. Singe player (Play and Practice modes) and multiplayer (H.O.R.S.E. and \"1 on 1\"). H.O.R.S.E. mode is a level editor: the created levels can be given as a challenge to other players online (and vice versa: the player will face levels created by their challenger). A \"trash talk\" option allows to send challenging words together with the level. 1 on 1 challenges are played by splitscreen on the same iPad. In Challenge arenas, the player must satisfy specific requirements to clear levels (e.g. making the ball bounce at least 2 times before going into the basket).</p>\n<p>Four different robots are available later in the game (only one at the beginning).

The game is played on a <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/8199/genre-board-game-reversi-othello/\">Reversi/Othello</a>-grid, but with a 7x7 grid rather then 8x8, where the objective is to end up with more pieces then the opponent. Each player starts with two game pieces, known as microbes or cells, in diagonal corners. The player can make two possible moves each turn, either creating a new microbe adjacent in any 8 directions to a current microbe, or move a microbe two positions away, and losing the original position. In any case the destination has to be unoccupied, and all of the opponent's microbes adjacent to the new cell will be captured by the player who moved the cell.</p>\n<p><em>Infection</em> can be played against Henry Stauf, the main antagonist from <em>The 7th Guest</em>, with 7 difficulty levels. As in the original game, Stauf often taunts the players between moves. There is also a <em>Mono Y Mono</em> option where two human players can play together on the same device, and a <em>Demo mode</em> where the AI controls both players.</p>\n<p>The game was created as a stand alone game partly because the iOS version of <em>The 7th Guest</em> lacked this puzzle, due to technical obstacles.</p>",

The player's objective is to deliver cargo to people across three regions: the prairie, desert and mountains. Each mission becomes increasingly difficult and requires players to arm their trains with more advanced weaponry as Dr. DeRaille dispatches more powerful RoboCars to prevent the player from making deliveries. The player must successfully complete each mission to advance to the next level.</p>\n<p>The game is free-to-play and offers in-app purchases to make the trains more powerful.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>ALFA-ARKIV</em> is an alternate reality interactive fiction game. The app presents itself as an intelligence database that has been hijacked by freedom fighters. The player, as a new ally of this mysterious group, may access documents such as videos, confession statements, handwritten letters, etc, all of which relate to a woman named Rhea Numitorova. A member of a radical activist group called the Junsui, Rhea was detained by a Russian paramilitary organization after a failed suicide bombing. The further players go, the more they will discover about Rhea, the Junsui, and related figures and organizations, and new information will call the veracity of previous documents into question. At certain points in the story, players may communicate with a chatbot or receive in-app messages from characters, which allow the player to choose if and how they want to proceed.</p>\n<p>The game deliberately blurs the lines between fiction and reality. Not only is its story based heavily on real-world events, but players are often asked to visit websites and download software outside of the app, which will reveal new information to further the story.</p>",

They can freely place different objects on the screen, and once they are done, press the play button. This makes the physics engine take care of the rest. Depending on the creativity of the solution, a maximum of three stars can be earned, affecting the player's rating. The game also includes a level editor and by completing chapters more items to use in it are earned.</p>",

Unlike the PC version, which includes both flat and jumps schedules, the iPad has separate builds for each: the Flat Racing Edition and the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/161461/starters-orders-4-jumps-racing-edition/\">Jumps Racing Edition</a>. The Flat Racing Edition of the game includes UK, IRE, US and Australian game modes.</p>\n<p>The iPad editions lack replays, race commentary, online league play facilities, jockey control options, the construction kit, user schedule creation facilities, game horse transfers, and player horse notes. They also only have one save game slot each and include only one meeting per day in-game (except from in foreign feature races). The form book and horse pool are also smaller.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Starters Orders 4 (Jumps Racing Edition)</em> is a downgraded version of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/132512/starters-orders-4/\">Starters Orders 4</a> for the Apple iPad. Unlike the PC version, which includes both flat and jumps schedules, the iPad has separate builds for each: the Jumps Racing Edition and the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/161460/starters-orders-4-flat-racing-edition/\">Flat Racing Edition</a>. The Jumps Racing Edition of the game includes UK and Irish game modes.</p>\n<p>The iPad editions lack replays, race commentary, online league play facilities, jockey control options, the construction kit, user schedule creation facilities, game horse transfers, and player horse notes. They also only have one save game slot each and include only one meeting per day in-game (except from in foreign feature races). The form book and horse pool are also smaller.</p>",
