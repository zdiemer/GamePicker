        "description": "<p>The simple little country girl Papri has a problem: her boyfriend Minto seems to show signs of interest towards another little girl, Cocco. Papri has to win his love back! The only way she can achieve that is by collecting flower bouquets, presenting them to Minto as a token of her feelings and gradually making him forget the other girl.</p>\n<p><em>Girl's Garden</em> is <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/43207/yuji-naka/\">Yuji Naka's</a> debut and an early precursor of games with dating gameplay mechanics. Papri has to move through a confined top-down area, collecting flowers on the way. After having collected ten flowers, Papri can enter her boyfriend's house, completing a round and advancing to the next one, with the same goal but increased difficulty. Flowers must be picked up at full blossom; catching them too early will have no effect, while collecting wilted flowers will make Papri lose half of her bouquet.</p>\n<p>Papri's health is called \"love\" in the game, and is represented by hearts. She loses a heart if she falls into water or if a bear comes too close to her. Bears are roaming the area and can be temporarily distracted by dropping honey pots on the ground. Bees act as allies and will supply Papri with honey and bonus items that increase the score.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Golgo 13</em> is a scrolling shooter based on the manga of the same name, putting the player in control of its main character, the assassin Duke Togo. In this adaptation, however, the protagonist's goal is, on the contrary, to rescue people. The screen scrolls horizontally, displaying Duke on a car that is moving along the road, trying to keep up with a moving train on top of the screen. The player can move the car left and right, aligning it with the train's cars.</p>\n<p>The goal is to shoot the train's windows, letting the people trapped inside run out. The player controls a crosshair, moving it in all directions, and presses the fire button to shoot. Between the player-controlled character and the train there is another track with a never-ending cargo train on it; tall cars of this train will not only block the crosshair's path, but also bounce the bullets back at Duke, hurting him. In later stages trucks will appear on the road and helicopters will shoot missiles at Duke.</p>",

The inhabitants of Terram has constructed a terrifying weapon that can destroy space-time. The player character, piloting the Orguss craft, has 2:30 minutes to get to the weapon and deactivate it. This is done by flying either in the native ship form, or transforming into the powerful mecha Orgroid. The mecha shoots repeatedly if the player presses the fire button, while the ship's gun has to be fire separately for each shot. However, when the protagonist is in mecha form the screen scrolls slower, preventing the player from getting to the weapon in time. Enemies include hostile craft and stationary turrets on the ground. There are no power-ups of any kind, and the only stage of the game repeats itself after completion with increased difficulty.</p>",

In this title you play as Sherlock Holmes at the end of the 19th century who has agreed to find the portrait stolen from the art gallery. Basic gameplay is based around choosing appropriate commands such as Look, Take, Talk, Examine and so on, a separate menu also summons up the verbs related to movement such as Move or Enter. Despite those commands being in English, the majority of game text is in Japanese only, as the game was not released anywhere else. </p>\n<p>To solve the case you are free to explore the city of London which is presented as a grid map with 34 square in total, each of whose could be visited by a persistent investigator. To advance the plot you'll have to search the locations for clues, collect them in your inventory and speak with the characters by asking them about things you have learned so far. You can highlight objects and people using a cursor to get descriptions from Holmes which makes <em>Loretta no Shouzuo</em> somewhat a point'n'click title. Besides the city map, there are also a couple of maze-like locations that needs to be explored on their own.</p>",

The game is largely identical to the NES version, but this is the first release of the game for the SG-1000 platform. A major difference is the addition of a third mission called Mission C available on the title screen.</p>\n<p>Also new is that the player can now choose a new character, Jet Puri, in addition to Jet Paco as the original protagonist. The character selection is also done on the title screen. The character Jet Puri was previously introduced through a game in the 2017 NES release <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/132546/mojon-twins-gran-sabiduria-31-in-1-real-games/\">Mojon Twins Gran Sabidur\u00eda: 31 in 1 Real Games</a>, but unlike that game she wears clothes in this release.

        "description": "<p><em>Wonder Boy</em> on the SG-1000 is more of a de-make of the game released in the Arcades and various other platforms. The game features only five levels of one stage each. The design of the levels is different and several enemy types, bosses and bonuses are missing from the game entirely, including the game's iconic skate board and the invincibility fairy.</p>\n<p>The core gameplay remains intact with the player controlling Tom-Tom through various side-scrolling levels while avoiding or attacking enemies with a hatchet. Points are scored by collecting fruit. Tom-Tom has limited lives to reach it al the way to the final level.</p>",
