        "description": "<p><em>Deep Six</em> is an underwater shooter, in which one or two players (alternating) control a diver hunting for treasure. The diver is equipped with a harpoon gun with unlimited ammunition, but there are air reserves that will get depleted over time. The game is segmented into three screens, the goal of the first two is to clear them of the small fish, respectively jellyfish that swim around. Larger enemies also appear which can be shot for bonus points. On the third screen lies the treasure, guarded by giant octopi. These cannot be killed, but they can be stunned. After gaining the treasure, bonus points are awarded and the game begins again.</p>",

The player is in control of a car that leaves a blue streak while it drives through a city, viewed from an overhead perspective. The goal is to turn all the black roads into blue. Other cars and roadblocks must be avoided. The other cars can also turn into steamrollers which revert the colors back. The player can use emergency hazards which make the car temporarily invincible and allows you to drive into the other vehicles to stun them and receive bonus points. The supply of these hazards can be replenished by driving over oil cans that sometimes appear. There are also letters that spell out\" BONUS\", which can be collected for additional points. Once the entire street grid is turned blue, the next stage begins.</p>",
